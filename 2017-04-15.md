# Separation underway

- Overreaction
 - terms
  - "doesn't make a big deal out of it"
  - "dink"
  - "gyp"
  - "scalp"
  - "rape"
 - news
  - "So-and-so was elected, prepare for concentration camps"
   - insulting to fellow humans

- In session
 - My recollection:
  - Me: "I'd like to talk about what a separation would look like"
  - Dr P: "... Divorce... ?"
  - Me: "I don't know..."
  - Raine: "I need you to commit one way or another."
  - Me: "When you put it like that..."
 - Take-aways
  - Not everyone is as smart as her
  - Especially when they're upset
  - Not everyone things before they speak
  - Something, something ... intuition ...
  - This isn't news!!!
