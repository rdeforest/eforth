What I wrote to Bruce:

    Raine and I went to Ike's and then to Canterbury. We were having a great
    time, were playing shuffleboard and then I had to use the restroom. It
    took me a while because I was having booze squirts as consequences from
    Jay's going-away thing. When I came out I explained that to her and she
    asked "how was Jay's thing?" I told her about various things including
    "Gay Jay" introducing himself as such and repeatedly doing so through the
    night, and then to clarify I mentioned the phenomenon when kids like a
    particular line in a movie and won't stop repeating it, then I offered as
    a counter example a friend-of-a-friend in Irvine, CA who introduces
    himself as Gaysian, and then I said, "but he doesn't make a big deal out
    of it." Raine kinda blew up at me and it just kept getting worse the more
    we talked about it. At the end I said this was super weird to have an
    argument where neither of us disagrees with the other, and what is going
    on with her. She said "I'll give you some time to figure it out." I took
    that to mean that I shouldn't walk home with her and said as much, then I
    asked if you were free for a chat.

- she thought I was saying
  - there is a good vs bad way of being out
  - and that she thought so too
- If that were true, I would have said it in as many words

- I'm jerking _her_ around?!
  - What about her bag of pills?!
  - she turns on a dime
  - she is loud for quiet things and quiet for loud things
  - She said she felt me withrdraw, but
    - I felt pushed away starting from when she cut off her mom
    - Or possibly after our Tokyo trip...
  - I'm too often wrong about what she's thinking or feeling, good or bad
  - Alcohol is an excuse/facilitator, not a cause
  - She gives me the same hostile treatment she gives people she doesn't like
  - What about her saying she has no friends?
    - I think her many friends would be hurt to hear that

- I tried so hard but nothing's ever good enough

- She's angry?! Ha!
