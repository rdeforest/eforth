Hi Martha,

Sorry it took me so long to send this. I ended up chatting with somebody.

Raine and I have been having problems for a few years. In 2016 she gave me an
ultimatum that if I didn't get us a counselor by the end of the year she would
leave me. I got us a counselor in the middle of December. We have been going
to sessions and some things were getting better but I felt worse.

On April 14th we had a counseling session in which I asked to discuss what a
separation might look like. I don't quite remember how the conversation went
from there because I got super upset but the upshot was the Raine thought I
wanted out right away, was super pissed at me and wanted her space. She didn't
give me specific parameters for what her space was so I have only contacted
her once. She has contacted me since and given me permission to send her SMS
messages strictly related to arranging for me to come pick up stuff from the
apartment. She requires that all future communication be through our
counselor. I'm meeting our counselor tomorrow and hoping to figure out more
about Raine's requirements and expectations then.

For now I'm couch surfing, but eventually I will probably need a new place to
live, and until Raine can support herself I won't be able to afford much. I
talked with my manager and he said we could probably make arrangements for me
to work remotely for a while. If I find out tomorrow that there is no way
Raine will let me stay at our apartment then I will be looking for long-term
housing.
