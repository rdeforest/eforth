                        RIP, Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011)                        

There's a pair of handcuffs by the bed. They're surrounded by empty Chinese
food cartons, an empty bottle of wine, and two wine glasses. One of the
glasses has fallen over, leaving a red stain on the carpet which slowly
creeps towards the handcuffs.

The alarm clock went off an hour ago, but the room's inhabitants have shut
it off, preferring the warmth of their shared bed to the cold of the real
world.

Ow, crampped. The blanket in the back probably covers a hole that the cold could get in through, so don't move it to much. How can anyone live in a refridgerator box?
