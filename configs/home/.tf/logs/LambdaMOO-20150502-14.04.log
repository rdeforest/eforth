PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

You note that the 60 watt incandescent bulb implies that the owner either doesn't care about the environment, or hasn't changed anything since compact flourestent lights became affordable.

Message 1169 on *Server-Hackers (#24451):
Date:     Fri Apr  3 22:26:42 2015 PDT
From:     Puff (#1449)
To:       *Q&A (#48454) and *Server-Hackers (#24451)

I have no idea where to post this, but:

I use mud.el with the moo extensions.  Emacs 24 came out a couple
years ago and today I took it out for a test drive.  Emacs24 breaks
mud.el.  I'm not sure how because I can't even log into the moo.  I
connect to the MOO but the session doesn't show me the ">" prompt and
typing the connect command doesn't seem to do anything.  I'm guessing
the bit that actually takes input and sends it to the telnet
connection is broken, but that's pretty obvious.

Dunno if anybody else who still MOOs and/or cares about this speaks
enough elisp to debug it, but I thought it was worth putting out
there.

Puff the fractal dragon
Puff The Fractal Dragon, a draconic form composed of computer generated fractal images. His scales gleam and shimmer with the constant impact of electrons on phosphors, and his claws, sharper than Occam's Razor, glint with a varicolored glow. In spite of all of this, he seems to be quite a cute and almost cuddly little flying blowtorch.  Puff the fractal dragon's yellow Speedo swim trunks hug him closely.  Wyatt is wearing the most comfortable of his boots, his black Ropers. They are a bit ragged due to long periods of wear and tear.  Although it is unbuttoned a bit at the top, Puff the fractal dragon looks professional her white nurse's uniform. The dress hugs her bust, showing a fair amount of her cleavage. The uniform tapers snugly at the waist, where it flares out over her generous hips, stopping rather short mid-way down her smooth thighs.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 4 hours.

Information about Verb Permuter(#128):@permute-verbs
----
Syntax:  @permute-verbs <object>

prints out a tableau whose lines you can rearrange to get the verbs of a particular object in the order that you want them.  Concatenating these lines and executing the resulting expression carries out the permutation.

Showing help on `caller_perms()':
----
Syntax:  caller_perms ()   => obj

Returns the permissions in use by the verb that called the currently-executing
verb.  If the currently-executing verb was not called by another verb (i.e., it
is the first verb called in a command or server task), then
`caller_perms()' returns `#-1'.
