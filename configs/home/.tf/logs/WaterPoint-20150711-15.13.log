INTRODUCTION
============

A MOO is a kind of virtual reality, in which players move about from place to place manipulating their environment in what we hope are amusing, entertaining, or enlightening ways.

This is just a simple introduction to how to get around; more introductory texts are being written and will be listed here as we finish them.

Most commands have the form of simple English sentences:

    <verb>
    <verb>  <direct object>
    <verb>  <direct object>  <preposition>  <indirect object>

Don't use English articles (e.g. 'a', 'an', or 'the') in your commands; the MOO won't understand them.  You can refer to yourself as 'me' and the room you're in as 'here'.

The first five kinds of commands you'll want to know are listed below.  Type 'help <topic-name>' for details on any of them:

look[1]
      getting a description of the current room or any other object
say[2]
      speaking to the other players in the same room as you
@who[3]
      showing which players are currently connected to the MOO
movement[4]
      how to move around in the MOO, from room to room
@quit[5]
      disconnecting from the MOO

-----
MOVEMENT
========

The descriptions of most rooms outline the directions in which exits exist.  Typical directions include the eight compass points ('north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'northwest', and 'southwest'), 'up', 'down', and 'out'.

To go in a particular direction, simply type the name of that direction (e.g, 'north', 'up').  The name of the direction can usually be abbreviated to one or two characters (e.g., 'n', 'sw').  You can also type 'go <direction>' or 'go to <location>' to move; this is particularly useful if you know you're going to type several movement commands in a row (see `help go'[1]).  

Other commands for moving about include:

walk[2]
      going to a particular place
join[3]
      joining a particular person
home[4]
      returning to the place you live

Barry says, "HI"
Barry [to Crag]: it looks idle
Rob . o O ( to an untrained eye )
Charkes is asked to 'edit together' two videos for church
Charkes says, "I get 3 videos.  want me to put them in a certain order and just cut out one of the interviews from the long video?"
Charkes says, "response: List of shots, section of interview, more lists of shots, switch to person talking but keep volume low"
Charkes says, "wtf"
Rob says, "guess it's a real editing job!"
Crag idly wanders off.
Crag stands up from the first couch.
The Hallway
You see an operating systems record, a black chest, a timer.asm, a stamp, a doorknob, an idol, a birdie, a clam shell, an Internet health report, a bag of cheese chunks, a broom, a dictionary, a lamp, THIS, a duffel bag, and a linking book to Everything We Do Is Games (beta 1) here.
rgm is here, off in another world.
The Gull Point Lighthouse
A basic circular room forms the main entrance and the base of the light tower of the lighthouse.  A wooden chair is here.  A blue chair is here.  The door out is closed.  Dark stairs spiral down into the basement.  An old narrow ladder leads upward.  A door to the east leads to the house.  It is open.
Crag has arrived.
Crag sits on the wooden chair.
