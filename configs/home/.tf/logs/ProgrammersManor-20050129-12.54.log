The Elbow Room
The Elbow Room. You will no longer have to fight for it. But you do have to elbow your way in.  A Lux's nifty egg chair is here.  A Woven Morris Mat is here.
A sign here says, `Topic: Friday'
You see a crankcase here.
stormagnet, Devlyn_Syde, and Devil are here, asleep.

HELP ON THE LOGIN WATCHER MARK 2
================================

This feature can notify you when people connect and disconnect.   Try typing `@add-feature login' and `@login' to get started.

@login-o*ptions @Logino*ptions
==============================

@login-option <option> [is] <value>   sets <option> to <value>
@login-option <option>=<value>        sets <option> to <value>
@login-option +<option>     sets <option>   (usually equiv. to <option>=1
@login-option -<option>     resets <option> (equiv. to <option>=0)
@login-option !<option>     resets <option> (equiv. to <option>=0)
@login-option <option>      displays value of <option>

@login-options for a listing of available options.

@inter*esting
=============

Usage: @inter*esting [player] ...
Declares players interesting to you.
Displays current list of interesting players if called with no arguments.
An empty interesting list means you see all logins/logouts.

@uninter*esting
===============

Usage: @unint*eresting player [player ...]
Declares players to be uninteresting to you.  (I.e. removes them from your .interesting list.)

@login
======

Usage: @login [on|off|all|interesting]
Without arguments, tells you your current login-watcher settings.
@login on and @login off do the obvious.  If `all' is specified, sets the login watcher to show all login announcements, even those for people not in your interesting list.  If `interesting' is specified, sets the login watcher to show only login announcements for people in your interesting list.

You are currently listening to login watcher announcements for everyone.
