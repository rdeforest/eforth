Crag says, "YAY"
Crag says, "That was a long outage"
stormagnet says, "DAMN that was a long outage"
stormagnet loses
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "The house actually got COLD"
Crag says, "I wonder if I'll hear from Kia or Tom about it"
stormagnet says, "Because all the appliances/computers were off"
Crag heh
Crag says, "That's kinda scary"
stormagnet had to turn on the heat when the power came back on
stormagnet has cold fingers
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "How much do we spend on electricity?"
stormagnet says, "Our house is heated by MULTITASKING"
stormagnet says, "Too damn much"
Crag slaps a Powered by AWESOME sticker on the house
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Maybe we should look into reducing our power usage somehow"
stormagnet says, "We actually use less than average"
stormagnet says, "It just COSTS too much"
Crag says, "Still, there might be some easy ways we could conserve"
stormagnet says, "The bill has a nifty little graph on it that tells you how your power consumtion stacks up"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "NUMBER ONE: NEW WINDOWS"
Crag says, "I should put that on the tasks or notes or something on the horde"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "NUMBER TWO: GAS STOVE"
stormagnet laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: after the re-fi we might actually be able to afford windows
stormagnet says, "These actually aren't very note-taking worthy"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "no?"
stormagnet says, "They're the obvious fixes that have been frustrating me :P"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I wonder how much of our usage goes to computers"
stormagnet says, "Upgrading our thermostat is probably a good idea, too"
Crag says, "I'm going to start leaning on Top about moving the artspun server"
Crag says, "yeah, that would be nice anyway"
stormagnet says, "Get a nice programable one, with ambient temperature detection that WORKS"
stormagnet says, "Tom?"
Crag says, "Boothby"
stormagnet pictures the grocery store hauling the server away in a truck full of cabbages
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "And now... TEA! AND BREAKFAST!"
Crag says, "HOLY CRAP, IT'S 2PM"
Crag cries
stormagnet says, "You SURE you don't want to come home before jamming?"
stormagnet could make you some chicken soup
Crag says, "I am coming home"
Crag says, "That's what I said on the phone"
Crag says, "hold on, phone"
Crag says, "ok, back"
Crag says, "Yes, I'm coming home so we can drop that check off"
Crag says, "It sounded like asking you to do it was going to be a waste of your time"
Crag says, "Maybe I only thought that and didn'"
Crag says, "ARG"
Crag says, "I'm having a really bad day"
Crag says, "Maybe I didn't say it"
Crag says, "I don't want to come home early because I keep getting farther behind at work"
Crag says, "I have 30 tickets in my queue and 22 unassigned tickets"
Crag says, "I can probably ignore the unassigned ones for now, but I'm still stressing about them"
Crag says, "I'm sorry to leak my stress all over you"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "Yeah, it would have been a really big waste of time for me, but I was still willing to do it if you were really bogged down ^_^;"
Crag hugs
Crag says, "I'm horribly bogged down"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm vaguely considering canceling band practice"
stormagnet says, "You probably should"
stormagnet says, "Between all this work crap AND feeling under the weather"
stormagnet says, "It's a recipe for disaster"
Crag says, "I'm not actually sick"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Just sniffly"
stormagnet says, "YET"
stormagnet says, "That's the key word"
Crag says, "and I've cleared up"
Crag says, "I think it's allergies"
stormagnet says, "AH"
Crag says, "I think I'm having difficulties with the cats"
stormagnet says, "That would explain the headaches, too"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "How's your stomach feeling?"
Crag says, "it's fine now"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "maybe not 'fine'"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "I know what the root cause of ALL of this is: work"
Crag says, "and I've done everything I can about that"
Crag says, "If I were at full-power, my body could handle the feline attack just fine"
stormagnet nods

When the levee breaks

"It appears that the money has been moved in the president's budget to handle
homeland security and the war in Iraq, and I suppose that's the price we pay.
Nobody locally is happy that the levees can't be finished, and we are doing
everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us."
-- Walter Maestri, emergency management chief for Jefferson Parish,
Louisiana; New Orleans Times-Picayune, June 8, 2004
This picture is an aerial view of New Orleans today, more than 14 months
later. Even though Hurricane Katrina has moved well north of the city and the
sun is out, the waters continue to rise in New Orleans as we write this.
That's because Lake Pontchartrain continues to pour through a two-block-long
break in the main levee, near the city's 17th Street Canal. With much of the
Crescent City some 10 feet below sea level, the rising tide may not stop
until until it's level with the massive lake.

There have been numerous reports of bodies floating in the poorest
neighborhoods of this poverty-plagued city, but the truth is that the death
toll may not be known for days, because the conditions continue to frustrate
rescue efforts.
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
stormagnet says, "THat's a better summary of what I was talking about earlier"
stormagnet says, "Though I had NOT known about that little budget shuffle there"
Crag says, "woof"
stormagnet says, "As if the global warming angle on this wasn't ALREADY going to fuck Bush, there's that"
stormagnet says, "And this is hitting his 'base' pretty hard"
Crag says, "Too bad he's already on his second term"
stormagnet says, "Practically the entire fucking Bible Belt is under water right now"
stormagnet NODS
Crag heh
Crag says, "GOD IS PISSED"
God says, "I thought I was quite clear..."     --Crag
stormagnet says, "You already saw last years Florida map, right?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "DAMN STRAIGHT"
Crag says, "That was awesome"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Seriously, if there is a God, then I posit that he would be RIGHTEOUSLY PISSED"
stormagnet says, "They're in for some smiting"
Crag says, "Hm, I wonder"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I wonder what the difference between a typhoon and a hurricane is"
stormagnet says, "Is it just that one is formed in the Pacific Ocean and the other in the Atlantic?"
Crag says, "I bet Wikipedia knows"
stormagnet says, "That would be pretty stupid"
Crag says, "I think that might be it"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "OH COME ON!"
stormagnet says, "THAT IS STUPID!!"
Crag heh
stormagnet begins a campaign to call them ALL "tropical cyclones" 
Crag heh

The Senate was seeking to restore some of the SELA funding cuts for 2006. But
now it's too late. One project that a contractor had been racing to finish
this summer was a bridge and levee job right at the 17th Street Canal, site
of the main breach. The levee failure appears to be causing a human tragedy
of epic proportions: "We probably have 80 percent of our city under water;
with some sections of our city the water is as deep as 20 feet. Both airports
are underwater," Mayor Ray Nagin told a radio interviewer.

Washington knew that this day could come at any time, and it knew the things
that needed to be done to protect the citizens of New Orleans. But in the
tradition of the riverboat gambler, the Bush administration decided to roll
the dice on its fool's errand in Iraq, and on a tax cut that mainly
benefitted the rich.

And now Bush has lost that gamble, big time. We hope that Congress will
investigate what went wrong here.

The president told us that we needed to fight in Iraq to save lives here at
home, and yet -- after moving billions of domestic dollars to the Persian
Gulf -- there are bodies floating through the streets of Louisiana. What does
George W. Bush have to say for himself now?
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
stormagnet says, "FUCKING HELL"
stormagnet says, "I really may never get to see New Orleans"
Crag says, "That wasn't from the mainstream media, was it?"
stormagnet says, "Sadly, nay. Atrios"
stormagnet says, "But Atriod IS super highly trafficed and linked, so now the cat's out of the bag pretty thoroughly"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "It's hard to argue with natural disaster"
Crag says, "AND Natural disasters are the one thing almost everyone can agree The State should protect against and help clean up after"
Crag says, "Even Libertarians"
Crag says, "Partly because there's no way to fake a major disaster, or corrupt it or whatever"
Crag says, "And they're indiscriminant"
Crag says, "RAR"
stormagnet says, "And it's the sort of situation which canNOT be solved by The Rugged Individual"
stormagnet says, "It requires a huge amount of cooperation, organization, and foresight"
stormagnet says, "All notably lacking, lately"
stormagnet grrrrrrrrrs
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I CAN DRINK TONIGHT"
Crag says, "I'll look forward to that"
Crag says, "I'm going to go to practice still"
Crag says, "Playing is good for me"
Crag says, "But I won't stay past 8"
Crag says, "We're starting at 7 tonight"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "YAY DRINKING"
stormagnet was just looking at the Drinking Liberally site :P
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I'm heading home soon"
Crag says, "I never had lunch"
Crag sighs

Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "I'm doing my time now"
Crag says, "ok, here I come"

Crag says, "oog, a little hung over"
Crag says, "BUT WORTH IT"
Crag gets surly
Crag says, "I have a zit... on my ASS"
Crag says, "And I KNOW it's going to pop at an awkward time."
Crag says, "and be extra gross"
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "godDAMN my oversleeping skills are advanced!"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH ZITS!"
stormagnet says, "HATES THEM!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ON MY ASS"

Crag says, "and a pony"
Crag says, "I'm sure Bartels stocks ponies"
stormagnet says, "YAY PONIES!"
