Crag says, "I didn't feed the cats"
Crag says, "I Had gastro-intestinal difficulties at 2am and was grumpy when I finally got up, so I left the cats unfed out of spite."
Crag says, "Sorry"
Crag says, "The difficulties were almost certainly due to not eating enough."
Crag says, "In other news, there are seven Narnia books.  More info at"
Crag | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Wikipedia has some C.S. Lewis quotes on the influence of christianity on his writing.  The quotes they selected make it sound like he merely drew from christian stories in the same way he drew from Celt, Roman and Greek stories."
Crag says, "Which seems likely considering the result."
Crag says, "I think anyone who praises or condemns the books for their link to christianity is either not thinking for themeselves or has some agenda they're pushing."
Crag says, "I think I forgot to mention last week that this project I'm doing with Jean next year will count as 'mentoring' him, which will help qualify me for promotion."
Crag says, "Dan Bernstien, the author of Qmail and some of the other software we run and a fairly major figure in computer science, math and cryptography, has included his birthday on his online resume."
Crag says, "You may remember my conversations with Shannon where we related Dan to some other prominent assholes in the public eye."
Crag says, "Everyone knows him as stubborn and difficult to communicate with.  He has Saturn in Gemini, square Mercury in Virgo."
Crag says, "Good stuff"
Crag says, "Daniel called.  He's driving up and weather in the pass slowed him down a lot.  I expect he'll hit holiday traffic in Portland and Seattle.  He's going to call again later, but it looks doubtful that he'll make it tonight."
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry to hear about your intestinal distress"
stormagnet says, "Curry should fix that up- lots of fiber in the vegetables and rice"
stormagnet says, "The cats were fine- that or I was just very soundly asleep. I didn't get up until 8 o_O"
stormagnet says, "And YAY PROMOTION!!"
stormagnet says, "Is Daniel coming up for work or play?"
stormagnet says, "It might even be for the best if he stays in Portland overnight, since the electricians are starting work tomorrow morning"
stormagnet says, "So if he arrives really late, there won't be much chance of his sleeping in tomorrow morning ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "Okay, and with that, I'm off to vacuum and decorate cookies"
stormagnet says, "Erm, vacuum the FLOOR, that is"
stormagnet says, "NOT the cookies"
Crag says, "You're awake"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Daniel's coming up for Deborah's 50th birthday (his brother's wife)."
Crag heh
Crag says, "Deborah expresses her Capricorn sun rather effectively, seeing as she's a VP of some sort at IBM"
Crag says, "It's been a slow day, but I've been spending the whole time on astrology"
Crag says, "Membrane responded to my Theory post and now I'm typing up an introduction to advanced astrology.  It turned out to be a lot harder to type up than I thought it would be."
stormagnet says, "Okay, there is officially no way in hell I'm going to get downtown before you get off work"
stormagnet says, "I'll have to do those errands tomorrow, or something"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I kinda thought that would be the case."
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet <- predictable
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'm done with my "intro to non-newspaper astrology""
Crag says, "I'll post a link in a sec"
Crag | http://defore.st/intro-to-astrology.txt
Crag says, "Wow, almost time to go home."
Crag says, "I totally slacked off all day"
Crag says, "In light of Doug's post about freezing rain and snow in Portland, I'd say Daniel has no chance of making it up here tonight."
Crag says, "Which is fine."
Crag says, "Sadly, NOAA doesn't seem to think we'll catch any of the excitement up here"
Crag says, "Oh, I mean Mrs. Doug's post, of course."
stormagnet says, "Dammit"
stormagnet says, "Adding a chimmney to the gingerbread house made it just barely too tall for the cake stand cover"
stormagnet needs more dome covers, dammit!
Crag grins.
Crag says, "That's pretty funny."
stormagnet says, "I guess I'll have to make do with saran wrap for now"
stormagnet makes a face
stormagnet says, "Only we're out of saran wrap, so I'll have to go to the store and THEN make do with saran wrap >_<"
stormagnet says, "w00t"
stormagnet says, "Student license of StarNet is only $60"
Crag says, "StarNet?"
Crag says, "I forgot to grab my lunch"
Crag says, "crap"
Crag says, "oh whew, nevermind"
Crag says, "I thought Wrack had another kernel panic, but it was just sleepy"
Crag blinks
Crag says, "Lost net for a while.  Wonder what that was about."
Crag says, "Shoreline police department publishes monthly crime maps"

Crag says, "Good stuff"
Crag . o O ( where is my stormy? )
