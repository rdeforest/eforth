Alert the President!

By Will Shetterly

Men's nipples. Women's periods. Diarrhea. Human ear lobes and wisdom teeth.
Hind leg bones in whales. Clear proof that there is an intelligence that
shaped the universe, and it's not very intelligent. Teach our children the
Theory of Stupid Design now!

MANDATORY PRESS RULES, EFFECTIVE AUGUST, 2005


Dear Press,

The Following rules are effective immediately:

1. Reporters' questions to the president must be in multiple choice, and
choice (C) must always be "because, unlike Terrorists, I like freedom"

2. All reports on SCOTUS nominee John Roberts must reference his supreme
awesomeness. Specifically:
- When mentioning Robert's relationship with the law, note that Roberts is
the pitcher.
- Mention upcoming Roberts biopic starring Heath Ledger.
- Democratic criticism must be followed by clip of Roberts using karate to
fight Nazis.
- If "Firm buttocks" are mentioned in any context, the report must also note
that firm buttocks is a quality shared by supreme court nominee John Roberts

3. All reports on UN nominee John Bolton must be properly framed.
- WRONG: President Bush Bypasses Senate with Recess Appointment
RIGHT: President Bush Saves America by Narrowly Averting Boltonless Hell

4. The word "torture" is hereby banned; substitute "insufficient luxury";
"detainee" should be replaced with "Islamurderer".
For example, "protestors complained about the torture of detainees" should be
replaced with "protestors complained about insufficient luxury for
Islamurderers"

5. Anchors will say "Raaa-or" and make claw motion after every Hillary
Clinton clip. Optional: whipping sound after Mr. Clinton clips.

6. Until further notice, all reports on Karl Rove must use soft-focus lens
and "Wind Beneath My Wings" backing track.

7. Speaking of backing tracks, these individuals now have the following theme
music accompanying all reporting on them:
- George Bush: "Eye of the Tiger"
- Dick Cheney: "March of the Valkyries"
- Rick Santorum: "Sprit in the Sky"
- Michael Moore: "Detachable Penis"
- Condoleezza Rice: "Iron Man"
- Ted Kennedy: "Too Drunk to Fuck"

8. No more asking the president about made-up foreign countries, and then
laughing when he tries to talk about it. That was funny like one time, and
its not cool anymore.

9. Remember, the following rule remains in effect: All reports on Iraq must
follow a lengthier story on:
- White Womens' ongoing struggle to remain unmissing.
- Who R. Kelly may have peed on today
- How Blogging is the new something, or how something else is the new blogging
- The hijinks of Tomkat
I don't want to single anyone out, but we noticed a certain network aired
only four minutes of Cruise coverage one night. We're paying Tom a lot of
money to carry on like that, people- and that money is wasted when you slack
off on the coverage.

10. Finally, keep up the good work! I don't want to end on a negative note,
so let me just congratulate everyone on their coverage so far. Keep it up
guys!

- Scott

ASTW: Have you thought about writing for some more formal publication or
submitting your stuff to something like Harper's or The Baffler?

MC: Writing popular online essays is like being the prettiest girl in
Scotland - satisfying on its own terms, but you can't let it go to your head.

If you look at a publication like the New Yorker, there's a dearth of
articles written by guys who sit around reading web links in their underwear,
and a profusion of articles by people reporting from remote places, or
speaking to anonymous sources they've cultivated over a lifetime of careful
journalism, or deploying vast reserves of wit and erudition against a topic
they've studied carefully. It all just sounds like work.

ASTW: Thanks for sitting down with us.

MC: Thanks for emailing me this template.

In Seattle, my personal highlights include- I managed to barf in a Jack in
the Box on Capitol Hill, and steal candy from a Wal-greens. Paco and I also
realized that tons of people trip on the sidewalk in Capitol Hill- in a span
of about 10 minutes, we probably saw about 4 people almost, or completely
beef it on the sidewalk. Damn Seattle is hella dangerous. We chalk it up to
wearing flip flops.

He didn.t break the skin or draw blood (although he did GROOOWWWWL and there
was SNARRLLLING), but he did scare the holy living shit out of me, even
though that.s not necessarily the hardest thing to do. Just ask Jon who
tonight put a rubber tarantula underneath the bag of ravioli I was about to
dump into a pot of boiling water. I BOUGHT THE TARANTULA, for crying out
loud, last year, in hopes of frightening Jon, the unfrightable fucker who has
more than once stuck his head over the shower curtain when I am mid-shampoo
to purposefully convince me that a serial killer has entered the house and
stumbled upon my bathing experience with glee.

Sure, I was speeding, officer -- I'm insured!
Wed Aug 10, 2005 11:22 AM ET

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Tired of parking fines and speeding tickets? A Swedish company offers insurance against both, claiming to be the first in the field.

Swedish drivers who register with the Bisso company at the Web site www.bisso.se and pay an annual fee of 850 crowns ($112) are covered against three speeding tickets a year, as long as they are not more than 30 km an hour (19 miles an hour) above the limit.

For an extra fee, drivers can buy cover against parking fines. Fines in Sweden, which has one of the best road safety records in the world, range from 800 to 2000 crowns for speeding and 425 to 700 crowns for parking offences.

"We believe drivers are under economic pressure and there is no room in household budgets to pay fines. We offer economic protection," said Dan Glimmeras, head of marketing at Bisso.

He told Reuters insuring against speeding fines was not illegal, but repeat offenders could still lose their license.

Several thousand people had signed up for the insurance since May, Glimmeras said.

How To Tell How Gay Your Gay Son Is

Your children are gay, you have always known it! But how can you prove it for
sure? Behold Giblets's Guide to Proving Your Son Is Gay! These are can't-fail
tests that should have you diagnosing deviant offspring as early as age 5.
There's no use bothering with your daughter; she's stuck as a girl as it is.

# Casually ask your son at dinner, "So, ever have sex with a woman?" If he
appears uncomfortable, he's gay. Non-gays like sex with women.

# Place two photographs in front of your son lying face down. On the left
place a photograph of Tom Welling, TV's gay Superman; on the right place the
stern but genial visage of James Dobson. Flip them over simultaneously. Which
does your son look at first? If he looks at Tom Welling, he is gay. If he
looks at James Dobson, he is gay with an unnatural fixation for James Dobson.

# Tell your son you are going outside to play ball and wrestle alligators.
Then shove your son to the ground repeatedly and say, "Whassamatta, crybaby?
Gonna cry? Gonna cry?" If he cries he is a great big pussy and therefore gay.
If he "takes it like a man" he's still gay, but one of those butch tough-guy
gays, like a "bear" or a "top."

# Dunk your son into a deep pool of water. If he floats to the top, he is
full of buoyant gaymotrons (identified by physicists as the gay particle) and
therefore gay. If he sinks to the bottom and drowns, he is a poor swimmer and
unathletic and therefore gay. If he begins to sink and then just sorta hangs
there, the water is gay.

# Starve a large wolf cub for two days and have it wrestle your son. If he
loses to the wolf, he's gay - it was only a wolf cub! If he beats the wolf,
he is a lesbian. If he is beaten mercilessly by the wolf while apologizing
for its economic agenda, he is a Log Cabin Republican. If he is bitten by the
wolf, he is now a werewolf. Shoot him with a silver bullet before the rising
of the next full moon.

Twenty-seven KIPP charter middle schools, including one in the District, have posted "large and significant gains" beyond what is average for urban schools, according to a report by the Educational Policy Institute.

The Virginia Beach-based research organization, using data provided by the Knowledge Is Power Program, said 1,800 mostly low-income black and Hispanic fifth-graders showed gains significantly above average in reading, language and mathematics from 2003 to 2004.

Science's Quest to Banish Fat in Tasty Ways
By MELANIE WARNER

Low-fat fried chicken may seem like a contradiction in terms, but not to
Stephen Kelleher. On a recent summer morning, he hovered over a whirling
assembly line as a waterfall of gray liquid cascaded over slabs of breaded
chicken. Then the magic began.

During the bath in the liquid solution, which consisted of water and protein
molecules extracted from a slurry of chicken or fish tissue, a thin,
imperceptible shield formed around the meat. When the chicken was submerged
in oil, the coating blocked fat from being absorbed from the fryer.

Voil! The chicken contained 50 percent less fat than a typical piece of fried
chicken.

Just another day in the strange world of food scientists. Mr. Kelleher, the
founder of Proteus Industries in Gloucester, Mass., is one of many chemists
who work, often in secret, in a little-understood part of the $550 billion
processed-food industry. These are the people who ultimately put food
together, and their mission is critical: developing foods that let consumers
have their cake and eat it, too.

With two-thirds of Americans considered overweight and yet many professing a
desire to eat healthier, every major food producer and food-ingredient
company has ordered its scientists to find the holy grail: products that
either have less bad stuff - fat, white flour, sugar and salt - or more good
stuff like whole grains, fiber and fish oil.

Some of these food additives are natural and some are not. But even those
that are natural hardly evoke images of a country harvest. Fat-repellent
coatings, after all, do not grow on trees.

Coming soon to your grocery store, for example, could be salty corn chips
cooked in oil but that are marketed as healthy because the addition of
chemically modified starches make them high in fiber. Labeled simply as
"modified cornstarch," this additive cannot be broken down until it reaches
the colon, much like the natural fiber found in fruit and vegetables. Also
coming soon: bread containing microscopic capsules of fish oil, enabling food
companies to contend that the bread is "heart-healthy" because of the
cholesterol and triglyceride-lowering omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil.

Some nutritionists question whether all this alchemy will further confuse
consumers about the basics of good nutrition. Marion Nestle, a professor of
nutrition at New York University, maintains that the best way to get fish oil
into your diet will always be to eat fish.

"What this does is to turn food into medicine," said Professor Nestle.
"Omega-3's occur naturally in food like fish, chicken and eggs, and plants to
a lesser extent. Why do we need to get it from bread?"

One reason may be that products that can be marketed as healthier often
generate higher sales and fatter profits for food companies. PepsiCo, for
instance, reports that sales of its healthier "Smart Spot" items - products
like Baked Lay's potato crisps, Tropicana orange juice, Diet Pepsi and Quaker
oatmeal - are growing at double the pace of other products.

Foods labeled as healthy also present a show of good faith to administration
officials, members of Congress, consumer groups and trial lawyers, who all
monitor the food industry's response to the nation's obesity problem.

Ingredient companies today sell $4 billion worth of additives to the food
industry a year and are responsible for many of the common properties of
processed food. Additives, for instance, keep the fruit in yogurt suspended,
not plopped at the bottom. They make sure that chicken dinners do not come
out of the microwave hot around the edges and cold in the middle, and they
allow many foods to stay in warehouses or on supermarket shelves for up to
nine months without spoiling.

Tate & Lyle of London, one of the largest food-ingredient companies in the
world, makes the popular sweetener Splenda. It recently started selling a
whole-grain "cracker system" composed of Splenda and hydrolyzed wheat
protein, an additive that has been manipulated - either chemically or through
enzymes - to give the softness of white flour without adding carbohydrates.

Other ingredient companies are focusing on what they can add to food to make
it healthier. Both Cargill, the commodities giant that has a large
food-ingredient business, and National Starch Food Innovation, the food arm
of National Starch and Chemical based in Bridgewater, N.J., and itself a unit
of the giant Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain, have seized upon the
fact that the average American consumes less than half the fiber each day
that the government recommends.

Nutritionists consider fiber beneficial because it prompts slower, steady
digestion, preventing spikes in blood sugar and insulin. It has also been
shown to lessen the risk of colon cancer.

The most obvious way to get more fiber into the diet is to increase
consumption of whole and unprocessed fruit, vegetables and beans. But food
companies say that many Americans are unwilling to make significant changes
in their eating choices to do this, and food companies are more than willing
to fill in the gaps.

Rather than simply add a fiber like bran to foods, which can produce a coarse
consistency that some dislike, Cargill and National Starch are selling
something called resistant starch. They start with starch that has been
extracted from either tapioca or corn and then modify it through a patented
process - Cargill uses chemicals and National Starch uses enzymes - so that
it will resist digestion in a way that mimics naturally occurring fiber.

Judy Marlett, a fiber expert and former nutrition professor at the University
of Wisconsin, explains that when starch is modified to be resistant, the
molecular structure changes. The bonds between glucose molecules are covered
up so that digestive enzymes cannot get to them. As a result, resistant
starch, like natural fiber, is not digested until it reaches the lower
intestine, where bacteria are finally able to break it down.

Dorothy Peterson, a starch specialist for Cargill, says that the company is
marketing resistant starch as an additive for products including bread,
muffins, pasta and corn chips, allowing companies to increase the fiber
content by several grams a serving. "It's a simple way to do fiber addition,"
Ms. Peterson said. "We've gotten a tremendous amount of interest from
customers."

One corporate customer already using National Starch's Hi-maize resistant
starch is Sara Lee, which has added it to several products in its Delightful
line of low-calorie bread. Listed on the label as cornstarch, it adds just
under a gram of fiber for each two-slice serving. Dannon is using a similar
product, resistant maltodextrin, in its Light 'n' Fit With Fiber yogurt,
which has three grams of fiber a serving.

Omega-3 fatty acids, which studies have shown to protect against heart
disease and are essential for brain development in infants, is another
ingredient that food companies are clamoring over. Last September, the F.D.A.
approved the health claim for omega-3 that it may reduce the risk of heart
disease.

The best source of omega-3's is the oil in fish. But fish oil is, well,
fishy, and is not a natural fit for inclusion in the likes of bread, muffins
and cereal bars. To deal with this, National Starch recently perfected
technology that encapsulates fish oil, so it can be added to foods without an
unappealing taste or smell.

A specially modified cornstarch and a vegetable protein, usually soy, are
mixed with water and fish oil and then cycled through machines that evaporate
the water. In the process, the starch and protein molecules attach themselves
to the droplets of fish oil, forming a shield. The concoction emerges from
the machines as a beige powder.

Jim Zallie, a food scientist and National Starch group vice president, says
that a company in Seattle is testing the product for its bread. The label on
the bread, he says, is unlikely to advertise the fish oil content, but simply
cite the presence of omega-3's.

Kellogg has signed a 15-year licensing deal with Martek Biosciences, a
company that sells omega-3 fatty acids derived from algae, which have a
milder smell and do not necessarily need to be encapsulated. Kellogg declined
to comment on the deal or when the algae-based omega-3's might appear in its
products.

Kerry Ingredients, a Wisconsin-based subsidiary of the Kerry Group, a
European food giant, is doing similar encapsulation with fiber, also to avoid
the unseemly taste and texture issues. Without encapsulation, the ground-up
soybean hulls the company is using as fiber make food taste a bit like
sawdust.

But guar gum, which comes from the seeds of the guar plant and is used widely
in food as an inexpensive thickener and stabilizer, is even more problematic.

Kerry Ingredients is using guar, which has a neutral flavor, as a fiber
source, "but it's the consistency of mucus," said Jack Maegli, a food
scientist who heads research and development for new products at Kerry
Ingredients. "If you eat too much of it, it invokes the gag reflex. I know it
sounds unpleasant, and it is unpleasant. That's why we encapsulate it."

The problem, Professor Nestle said, is that ingredients that are extracted
from their natural sources are never as good as the real thing. She cited
plant sterols, another seemingly healthy ingredient popping up in various
foods. Extracted from soybeans using a chemical solvent, plant sterols are
promoted for their cholesterol-reducing benefits and have been added to
yogurt, orange juice and cereal.

But, Professor Nestle said: "No way do plant sterols replace whole fruits or
vegetables, or even beans for that matter. The evidence is pretty clear that
foods work, but single nutrients don't."

Food companies insist that, unlike their critics, they are pragmatists. They
say their consumer research shows that convenience and taste still outrank
nutrition as the top priority for most people and that consumers have no
intention of giving up their favorite foods.

That is good news for the industry. If Americans stopped eating large
quantities of fried chicken, sweetened breakfast cereal, cookies and snack
chips, the financial health of many companies would suffer.

And that is why food scientists like Mr. Kelleher of Proteus Industries keep
searching for the perfect recipe for low-fat chicken.

Pat Verduin, head of research and development at ConAgra Foods, which sells
fried chicken and fish to restaurants and schools through its food-service
operations, says that other companies have tried other coatings using a
pectin-based solution, which leads to a gummy texture and oil that pools
unevenly on the surface of the product.

"I think what Proteus is doing is novel," Ms. Verduin said, adding that
ConAgra is looking at the technology. "They may be on to something."

US schoolkids run amok on internet
By Lester Haines
Published Wednesday 10th August 2005 14:08 GMT
Get breaking Reg news straight to your desktop - click here to find out how

US authorites are preparing to throw the book at 13 high school kids for "computer trespass" after the Dirty Baker's Dozen - aka the Kutztown 13 - bypassed school computer security measures to indulge in an orgy of net surfing and online chat.

The Pennsylvania perps face a 24 August meeting with the beak in the rather agreeably named Berks County juvenile court charged with computer trespass - an "offense state law defines as altering computer data, programs or software without permission" as AP explains. The possible punishments if they are found guilty include juvenile detention, probation and community service, although mercifully it appears that the prosecution will not be pushing for them to meet Ol' Sparky.

Which is surprising, since the list of outrages perpetrated by the gang makes chilling reading indeed.

It all began last Autumn when the education authority supplied around 600 Apple iBook laptops to students at the high school. Naturally, they came complete with net-access-limiting filtering programme, and snooping software allowing the powers that be to see just what their charges were up to.

The administrators had not, however, reckoned on the sheer determination and machiavellian cunning of the students. They quickly found the admin password allowing unrestricted internet access - not by a keystoke logging black op or extracting it from the IT manager at the point of a gun - but rather because it was taped to the back of every machine.

Unsurprisingly, the miscreants immediately ran amok online, surfing with impunity and indulging in that most forbidden of fruits - iChat.

Naturally, in the same way as youngsters sent to borstal will normally complete their sentence rather better informed about improved criminal methodology than rehabilitated back into society, once the Kutztown 13 had access to the wild wild web, they became more sophisticated in their criminal activities.

Although the admin password on some laptops was changed, the rascals cracked that using a decryption programme they found on the net. They also disabled the remote monitoring function and used it to spy on the administrators' own machines.

Finally, and most disturbingly, AP reports that "at least one student viewed pornography".

Hence the 24 August dateline with destiny. The parents of the Kutztown 13 claim that the school has overreacted, and that the kids are being punished for making monkeys of the system, rather than any serious misdemeanour.

One of the criminal masterminds, 15-year-old John Shrawder, reckons a felony conviction could hurt his future prospects. He told AP: "There are a lot of adults who go 10 miles over the speed limit or don't come to a complete stop at a stop sign. They know it's not right, but they expect a fine, not a felony offense."

Shrawder's uncle John agrees, and has set up a campaigning website to champion their cause. He said: "As parents, we don't want our kid breaking in to the Defense Department or stealing credit card numbers. But downloading iChat and chatting with their friends? They are not hurting anybody. They're just curious."

That's as maybe. The school's legal representative, Jeffrey Tucker, insisted: "The students fully knew it was wrong and they kept doing it. Parents thought we should reward them for being creative. We don't accept that."

We're inclined to agree. Older readers will recall that such behaviour in our day would certainly have attracted a sound thrashing with the birch and most likely transportation to the antipodes. The problem with the kids of today is that...

stormagnet says, "She came up and sniffed my fingers again, though she was still too skittish for petting :)"
stormagnet says, "It's definitely the construction noises from the neighbor's house that has her spooked"

stormagnet  ^_^
stormagnet is SO RELIEVED
stormagnet says, "Wow, she is going to TOWN on those clams"
stormagnet says, "The can is empty, I can hear from the clinking, and she's still licking it"
stormagnet says, "I think a) I may have discovered her favorite food"
stormagnet says, "and b) It probably WAS other cats that ate the food that sat out for her over night"
stormagnet says, "She looks really hungry"
stormagnet says, "And thinner again"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if I could get away with scooching the bowls closer to the house each time?"
stormagnet says, "Especially if I randomly substitute a can of clams for cat food every now and then?"
stormagnet says, "Hmmm."
stormagnet says, "Though it would be a stretch"
stormagnet says, "She likes the shrine because she can travel under the bushes to get to it"
stormagnet says, "She doesn't have to come out in the open"
