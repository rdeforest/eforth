Crag says, "bastards"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "There was an emergency that trumped ours, apparently"
stormagnet says, "And this must be THE day for plumbing emergebncies, because they're booked solid, and AHS couldn't find us anybody else"
stormagnet says, "So I head home anyway, since I'm all clean"
stormagnet says, "Which is kind of a relief, anyway"
Crag says, "Hm, pluto squared neptune maybe (I'm guessing pluto is the plumber's planet)"
stormagnet is going to skip the gym until she can get replacement shoes

stormagnet says, "Tips over 3 times between the gym and the library"
stormagnet says, "Once in the street, forcing me to miss my cross light and scuttle back to the curb"
stormagnet says, "THEN, at the library, I realize that I left TWO of my overdue books at home"
stormagnet says, "Then, once I get home"
stormagnet says, "Marco decides to pounce into my lap all affectionately"
stormagnet says, "AND MISSES"
stormagnet says, "Sometimes, those cross-eyes are not so cute"

stormagnet says, "And drawing blood"
stormagnet says, "AND, even though it's finally dry enough to rake leaves, I realized belatedly that the yardwaste bin was already full"

 Goalmaster3000 writes to tell us Joystiq.com is reporting that Jack Thompson has rescinded his offer of a $10,000 donation to charity if a video game were made to fit his model. Recently a group of GTA modders cooked up a scenario to fit the bill but apparently Thompson is claiming that his piece .A Modest Video Game Proposal. was intended as satire that the video game community was not bright enough to grasp. Perhaps Thompson was just afraid he was going to have to sue himself?

Fastest rapper on the planet

By Judy Chia Hui Hsu

Seattle Times staff reporter

Seven hundred twenty-three syllables in 51.27 seconds.

That's what it took for Seattle's Ricky Brown, also known as NoClue, to break the Guinness world record earlier this year to become the fastest rapper on the planet.
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "Did they have to slow down the recording to verify it?"
stormagnet says, "Certified speech therapist judged, plus a recording"
stormagnet says, "Hooray for online utility bill analysis"
stormagnet says, "Sadly, it appears that I lose bragging rights on water usage"
stormagnet apparently does a lot more dishes, laundry, and hot baths than everyone else
stormagnet . o O ( though the ancient-ass toilets probably have something to do with the matter, too. )
stormagnet finally finds the Penny Arcade news item previously mentioned
stormagnet says, "DAYAMN"
Crag grins.

Crag says, "So the initials are the same"
Crag says, "Silent 'p'"
Crag says, "Maybe phVulgar"
stormagnet says, "That reminds me!"
stormagnet says, "Were the war protesters out when you got home yesterday?"
stormagnet says, "There was this chick waving a raindow flag"
stormagnet says, "With word PACE on it"
stormagnet says, "I'm still trying to figure out if this is some activist-group acronym that I'm not hip enough to know, or if she was really that dumb"
Crag says, "I didn't see them"
Crag says, "But I like the idea of her being that dumb"
Crag says, "I know it's terrible of me"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I was just wondering..."
stormagnet says, "I mean"
stormagnet says, "She was SURROUNDED by other protesters"
stormagnet says, "Surely, if it didn't stand for something..."
stormagnet says, "Some one would have told her"

stormagnet says, "Plumber finally arrived"
stormagnet says, "Only he says he only has the kind of snake that WON'T FIT IN THE HOUSE"
stormagnet says, "But, on the bright side, both toilets were flushed multiple times without furthur sewage backflow"
stormagnet headdesks
stormagnet says, "And now AHS is refusing to cover any furthur service until we get a cleanout installed"
stormagnet says, "But the plumber was ever-so helpful in instructing me on how to rent a snake from Home Depot"
stormagnet says, "BIG VALUE for my $45 call-out charge there"
stormagnet says, "Not helpful to this situation as of yet, but..."
stormagnet says, "Our current equity in the house is $13537.32, or about 6%"
stormagnet says, "BofA's refinance calculator says refinancing for a 30 year fixed rate at 5.875% would give us a monthly payment of $1,327.78"

stormagnet says, ""
stormagnet says, "That assumes good credit standing"
stormagnet says, "AND"
stormagnet says, "The fees for refinancing end up being $8,655.25"
stormagnet says, "Not a zero-sum, but not the silver bullet I was expecting, either"
stormagnet says, "OHWAIT"
stormagnet says, "Okay, a little better- that $1,327.78 monthly estimate includes escrow"
stormagnet says, "Ie insurance and taxes"
stormagnet says, "So that's $562.22 less a month"
stormagnet says, "Refinancing aside, I'm hoping that just maybe that $13537.32 in equity will help convince BofA to give us that $5k revolving equity line of credit"
stormagnet says, "What we could use to get the drain clean-out installed"
stormagnet says, "In the meantime"
stormagnet says, "It looks like we're going to have Hardware Store Adventures on Thursday"
stormagnet says, "Though a bottle of that Rid-Ex rootkiller would be a good idea to try picking up tonight"
stormagnet . o O ( Maybe while I make dinner? )
stormagnet . o O ( Of course, that equity is based on the county property value estimate )
stormagnet . o O ( Not market value )
stormagnet . o O ( So there's something )
stormagnet . o O ( ....... )
stormagnet says, "HE-LO"
stormagnet says, "According to BofA's property value calculator, our house is worth "Valuation Range   Highest - $323,000   Lowest - $290,000""
stormagnet says, "Which would, for the LOWEST value, give us 22.6% equity, or $65,537.32"
stormagnet feels MUCH better
stormagnet says, "Divided by three years, that's $21,845.77 a year!"

I think my previous problem was in expecting any element at all to make
sense.  Now that I can completely read them as the story telling equivalent

stormagnet says, "wow, who knew that elevation maps were so hard to find online?"
stormagnet says, "and EXPENSIVE to buy?!"
stormagnet says, "And it has to be high resolution, because low resolution maps are like "ehn, it's all pretty much sea level""
Crag says, "What're you looking for elevation maps for?"
Crag says, "Trying to get high?"
Crag giggles something awful.
stormagnet says, "Pretty much, actually"

stormagnet says, "Though the patio-door siized kit has enough leftover to cover another regular-sized window :)"
stormagnet ponders doing the bathroom windows in patchwork, as they have no view to mar
stormagnet says, "But then, the humidity might make them peel right back off if they aren't anchored to the frame...."
stormagnet says, "OH- but they're divided into two pieces"
stormagnet says, "So I totally could"
stormagnet says, "Well, I'll figure on 4 boxes, and if the bathroom windows don't work out, I could either a) leave them uninsulated or b) buy another box"

[ a story from Seth, via email: ]

As you may know, we have cats. Three cats. One of them, the mother to the
other two, is named Uri(1). Uri is capricious, demanding, uninterested in the
needs or desires of others, smart in a way best described as "cunning," and
somewhat vindictive. She is also very soft. She is, in other words, a very,
very good kitty.

This is a story about Uri.

Like many people, we have a clock in the bedroom. This clock has a feature
known as as alarm: we can have the clock make a noise at a predetermined
time. We use this feature to wake us up in the morning; without it, I would
gladly wake up at sunset.

This clock also has a built-in radio. It doesn't seem like a good idea at
first. The radio has an ineffective antenna, a poor analog tuner that loses
signal, and a single, low fidelity, monaural speaker. However, the alarm on
the clock can play the radio rather than the overly loud, adrenaline surging,
teeth-paining buzzer. We use this "radio alarm" feature. Wouldn't you?

Over time, we have searched for the best station to tune the radio to for the
alarm. Talk radio was too easy to ignore. Music we really like a lot left me
lying in bed listening rather than getting up. We tried polka inspired
Mexican pop, the kind you hear if you leave your window open while driving in
Arizona; when heard at less than maximum volume, polka-pop proves to be
surprisingly soothing. We tried classic rock, but for every morning where
Zeppelin, Stones, Seger or some other artist with strong rhythm and melody
gave us a driving beat to start the day we had another where Kansas, America,
Boston, or some other place-named band with muddly, indistinct sounds(2) left
us late and befuddled. And please, let's not recall the day that started with
Supertramp(3).

We finally settled on a station offering music guaranteed to get us up, but
not unpleasant enough to ruin our day. I don't know the name, the call
letters, or the frequency, but it's San Francisco's "light jazz" station.
They play "light jazz" versions of classic muzak renditions of otherwise
mediocre songs, occasional jazz, and, god help them, the alto sax stylings of
mister Kenny G. I begin most days saying, "make the Bad Music go away."

I did wake up one day to a nice musical rendition of the Hoagy Carmichael
classic, Skylark. Sadly, I stayed in bed enjoying it a little too long. The
next selection was Branford Marselais(4).

Like I said, make the Bad Music go away.

Now, our clock is not a masterpiece of industrial design. Configuring the
alarm or radio requires a dizzying array of simultaneous button presses and
sliding of small, indistinguishable sliders to precise locations. To turn the
alarm off (and make the Bad Music go away), you have to press a small,
circular button in a field of similarly-sized small, circular buttons. The
one saving grace is a raised section on the all-important alarm-stopping
button. Without this affordance, we would throw the clock across the room at
least once a month to make it shut up.

This clock has other features. One of those is a baffling "timer" feature. At
the single press of a button (the only one-button operation on the clock)(5),
the radio turns on and plays for one hour, at which point it stops. While I
appreciate it refusing to play that station any longer, I do not understand
why anyone would use this feature. The sound from the radio is awful; no one
would use the radio to actually listen to music. Nonetheless, the feature is
there.

As you might expect from the level of design the clock exhibits, the "timer"
feature--unlike the small, hard-to-find "stop the alarm" button--is huge,
stretching across the entire clock in a large, easy-to-press bar.

Which brings us back to Uri. Remember Uri? This is a story about Uri.

Every morning, right after we wake up, even before we get food or water for
ourselves, we feed the cats. Knowing that we feed them before we eat
reassures them of the natural order of things. Uri is, as has already been
said, demanding.

This Saturday, we slept in late. It being Saturday, we hadn't set the alarm
and we had both played computer games until well into the night. As a
consequence, the cats' breakfast was delayed. The two non-Uri cats tried
their usual ploys to get us up: bumping our heads, screaming in our ears, and
jumping off the bookshelf onto us. Real cat owners, however, can sleep
through any cat behavior except that "hairball" sound(6).

We finally woke up because Uri was doing something unusual. She was on the
dresser by the bed, stepping onto the clock and back off of it, looking
confused, and repeating. We stared at her while she continued this behavior
for upwards of ten minutes.

Eventually, she hit the "timer" button, starting the Bad Music. She then ran
directly to the food bowls, waiting.

Yes, she's very smart. Yes, she's very clever. But not really. After all,
given a choice between going hungry and hearing Kenny G, which would *you*
chose?

      Seth.

(1) Yes, we know Uri is traditionally a male name. Get over it.

(2) Debate continues over whether Foreigner fits into this category.

(3) It's true. Supertramp really *has* always sucked. "Logical Song", my ass.

(4) There's nothing really wrong with Branford Marselais. If he changed his
name, he'd be a fine session musician and ensemble member with no solo career
barring the one solo album every jazz musician eventually gets. He'd be one
of those names the jazz station dj would use: "And that was, of course,
Branford <newname> on sax alongside the ubiquitous Clam on bass." The major
talent jazz djs require is the ability to say that kind of thing with
confidence born of knowing the audience can't see them reading the liner
notes. But honestly, no one wants to wake up to a former Sting backup player
and Jay Leno bandleader.

(5) Not actually true. There is also a "snooze" feature. I don't understand
it, having never used it, but apparently is only works right one time out of
five or so, given the number of times Becky has to hit it until it works.

(6) Yes, this is an old Nicole Hollander joke. I know where I steal my
material from. I'd just rather *you* didn't know.

Recently, the food supplements glucosamine and chondroitin have been shown to relieve symptoms of pain and stiffness for some persons with osteoarthritis. These supplements are available in pharmacies and health food stores without a prescription, although there is no certainty about the purity of the products or the dose of the active ingredients because they are not monitored by the FDA. The National Institutes of Health is studying glucosamine and chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis and this research will clarify many issues regarding dosing, safety, and effectiveness of these products for osteoarthritis. Patients taking blood-thinners should be careful taking chondroitin as it can increase the blood-thinning and cause excessive bleeding. Fish oil supplements have been shown to have some anti-inflammation properties and increasing the dietary fish intake and/or fish oil capsules (omega 3 capsules) can sometimes reduce inflammation of arthritis.

Separately, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were drenched by torrential rains brought by Tropical Storm Alpha, now downgraded to a tropical depression.

Forecasters warn Alpha, whose formation made this year's Atlantic hurricane season the most active since 1933, could strengthen again.

It is the first time the US National Hurricane Center has had to resort to the Greek alphabet to name a storm, after all 21 names pre-assigned for storms this year were used up.

The hurricane season still has five weeks to run.

from my little bro:
A leading architect of the intelligent-design movement defended his ideas
in a federal courtroom on Tuesday and acknowledged that under his
definition of a scientific theory, astrology would fit as neatly as
intelligent design.

Today's Science Test:
What's your sign?
What is the influence of Venus upon your sign?
What's are the 3 most common compounds in the atmosphere of Venus?
Why do you think God (or the FSM) put those compounds there?

Toronto ISP encourages connection sharing
Wireless Nomad is a bandwidth co-op in Toronto that encourages you to share your connection over wired and wireless links. Damien Fox sez:

    Basically, we are an ISP co-op that runs DSL lines where we have to, uses mesh networking where we can, gets homes and businesses online cheap, and provides free wireless Internet access to the community around our subscribers.

    High-speed Internet for homes is $30 a month, and businesses are $50 a month.  Because we are a co-op, people actually own their own Internet connection - and since freedom of the press belongs to those who own one, this is another step towards putting people in control of their communications and their community.  The medium is the message, as we've been told, and we think community-owned Internet with free wireless for everyone says a lot.

But the notes, now in Mr. Fitzgerald's possession, also indicate that Mr. Libby first heard about Ms. Wilson - who is also known by her maiden name, Valerie Plame - from Mr. Cheney. That apparent discrepancy in his testimony suggests why prosecutors are weighing false statement charges against him in what they interpret as an effort by Mr. Libby to protect Mr. Cheney from scrutiny, the lawyers said.

It is not clear why Mr. Libby would have suggested to the grand jury that he might have learned about Ms. Wilson from journalists if he was aware that Mr. Fitzgerald had obtained the notes of the conversation with Mr. Cheney or might do so. At the beginning of the investigation, Mr. Bush pledged the White House's full cooperation and instructed aides to provide Mr. Fitzgerald with any information he sought.

The notes do not show that Mr. Cheney knew the name of Mr. Wilson's wife. But they do show that Mr. Cheney did know and told Mr. Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.

Some lawyers in the case have said Mr. Fitzgerald may face obstacles in bringing a false-statement charge against Mr. Libby. They said it could be difficult to prove that he intentionally sought to mislead the grand jury.

Lawyers involved in the case said they had no indication that Mr. Fitzgerald was considering charging Mr. Cheney with wrongdoing. Mr. Cheney was interviewed under oath by Mr. Fitzgerald last year. It is not known what the vice president told Mr. Fitzgerald about the conversation with Mr. Libby or when Mr. Fitzgerald first learned of it.

It's Fitzmas in October! Mr. Wonkette woke us at six ayem today just to let us know that Dick Cheney was Scooter Libby's source for Valerie Plame's identity! Because that is how we roll. Specifically, we rolled over and back to sleep but now we're excited all over again. The investigation discovered Cheney's involvement because Scooter took notes on the meeting. Cheney! Involved! Will he be indicted? Who cares? Did he break a law? Surely not a very important one. The thing to remember here is that no one should ever let Scooter near pen and paper ever again.

The grand jury, whose term expires Friday, is scheduled for a session today. Before a vote on an indictment, prosecutors typically leave the room so jurors can deliberate in private, and ask that the jury alert them when it has reached a decision.

Unlike the jury in a criminal trial, grand jurors are not weighing proof of guilt or innocence. They must decide whether there is probable cause to charge someone with a crime, and they must agree unanimously to indict. The prosecutor could seek to seal any indictments until he announces the charges.

Fitzgerald has looked closely not only at the possible crimes, but also the context in which they would have been committed. This search, say lawyers in the case, has provided him a rare, glimpse into the White House effort to justify the Iraq war and rebut its critics.

The trail has often led to Cheney's office, which officials describe as ground zero in the effort to promote, execute and defend the Iraq war and the campaign to convince Americans and the world that Saddam Hussein had amassed a stockpile of the most dangerous kinds of weapons. According to the report in yesterday's Times, the investigation also led to Cheney himself.

In the 1980s, Iraq purchased somewhere in the region of 200 or more tons of uranium from Niger. The evidence that we had that the Iraqi government had gone back to try to purchase further amounts of uranium from Niger did not come from so-called 'forged' documents; they came from separate intelligence.

The new packaging was a useful step, but the company could have gone further, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said.

"A far better step would be to provide calorie counts right on the menu board, so consumers would have that one critical piece of information before they placed their order," Michael Jacobson, executive director of the consumer group, which is frequently critical of the food industry, said in a statement.

McDonald's said it had considered that step, but that the information was too complicated to put on the menu board.

Others are to be named as well, these sources said. According to U.S. officials close to the case, a bill of indictment has been in existence before October 17 which named five people. Various names have surfaced such as National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, yet only one source would confirm that Hadley was on the list. Hadley could not be reached for comment.

That Vice President Cheney is at the center of the controversy comes as no surprise. Last Friday, Fitzgerald investigators were talking to Cheney's attorneys, and detailied questionnaires, designed to pin down in meticulous sequence what Cheney knew, when he knew it, and what he told his aides, were delivered to the White House on Monday, these sources said.

The probe is far from being at an end. According to this reporter's sources, Fitzgerald approached the judge in charge of the case and asked that a new grand jury be empaneled. The old grand jury, which has been sitting for two years, will expire on October 28.

Thanks to a letter of February, 2004 in which Fitzgerald asked for and obtained expanded authority, the Special Prosecutor is now in possession of an Italian parliament nvestigation into the forged Niger documents alleging Iraq's interest in purchasing Niger uranium, sources said.

They said that Fitzgerald is looking into such individuals as former CIA agent, Duane Claridge, military consultant to the Iraqi National Congress, Gen. Wayne Downing, another military consultant for INC, and Francis Brooke, head of INC's Washingfton office in an effort to determine if they played any role in the forgeriese or their dissiemination. Also included in this group is long-time neoconservative Michael Ledeen, these federal sources said.

On the Hill, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), democratic whip, are asking for public hearings to lay bare the forgeries and how their false allegations ended up in President George Bush's State of the Union speech.

George Stephanopoulos:  Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, is probably in his last week in the investigation into the CIA leak.  What do you think is the worst thing that happened, based on what you've read so far?
Howard Dean:  Y'know, it's interesting.  This is not about Tom DeLay and Scooter Libby, although I...
Stephanopoulos:  Tom Delay?
Dean:  I mean it's not about Karl Rove.  There are so many scandals I can't keep track of `em all in the White House and in Congress.
