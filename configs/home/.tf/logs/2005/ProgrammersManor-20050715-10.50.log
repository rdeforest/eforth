Planetary three-sun baffles boffins
By Lucy Sherriff
Published Thursday 14th July 2005 15:58 GMT

A Caltech researcher has identified a planet that has three suns. We wondered immediately if it was in a galaxy far, far away, but sadly for headline writers everywhere, the four-body system lies a mere 149 light-years hence, well within our own Milky Way.

The system, known as HD 188753, is located in the constellation Cygnus. The planet, whose existence was indirectly determined by measuring tiny Doppler shifts in the spectra of the stars, is thought to be slightly larger than Jupiter.

A relatively large central star holds court. The planet orbits just eight million kilometres away from it, whipping around roughly once every 80 hours. Further out, at about the distance from our Sun to Saturn, the other two stars are locked in a binary orbit of each other, and whirl around the main stellar body.

It transpires that in this region of our galaxy, binary and multiple star systems are more common than singletons like our Sun. But the presence of a planet in this triple system has foxed astronomers, causing some to suggest that we need to rethink theories of planetary formation.

Author of the research, Caltech's Dr Maciej Konacki, said that working out how a planet formed in this setting was "very puzzling". What is agreed on is that the planet is unlikely to have formed in the "normal" (as we understand it) way. Conventional theories of planet formation hold that gas giants form far away from their star, with gases coalescing around an icy core.

Astronomers speculate that some then migrate inwards, dragged by the remaining material in the accretion disk around the star. This would account for the many gas giants discovered in very close orbits around their stars.

But in this system, the two smaller stars orbit in exactly the gas giant-forming zone, and would have demolished any potential planet-forming material.

Dr. Konacki suggests that it might be better to think of the planet as a failed fourth star that just didn't have the mass needed to get going.

Meanwhile, Artie Hatzes, an astronomer at the Thuringia State Observatory in Germany told Nature.com: "You shouldn't see it, but you do see it. Maybe nature found a way."

Konacki's paper is published in the current issue of Nature

Mouse study suggests Alzheimer's damage reversible
Thu Jul 14, 2005 02:06 PM ET

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tests on mice suggest the brain damage caused by Alzheimer's disease may be at least partly reversible, researchers reported Thursday.

Their genetically altered mice regained the ability to navigate mazes after the genes that caused their dementia were de-activated.

This suggests that the brain damage caused by Alzheimer's is not permanent, they wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

"I was astonished. I didn't believe the results when I saw them," said Alzheimer's researcher Karen Ashe of the University of Minnesota, who led the study.

"When I saw the memory getting better I actually thought I had done something wrong in the experiment."

Alzheimer's is a brain-destroying disease that affects an estimated 4.5 million people in the United States alone and millions more globally. As the population gets steadily older, experts estimate this number will balloon to as many as 16 million by 2015 in the United States.

Outward symptoms start with memory loss, which progresses to complete helplessness as brain cells are destroyed. In the brain, neurons die as messy plaques and tangles of protein form.

The two proteins involved are unhealthy forms of natural brain compounds called amyloid beta and tau protein.

Ashe's team worked with mice genetically engineered to develop the mutant tau, but this mutation could be stopped -- or de-activated -- with use of a drug called doxycycline.

As expected, the mice developed dementia and had brain atrophy similar to human Alzheimer's disease.

And when the engineered gene was turned off, memory loss stopped, as expected. But the mice did not merely stop getting worse. They got better.

"Even mice that had lost half the neurons that are involved in forming memories, when we removed the molecule causing the memory loss from the remaining neurons by turning off the genes, the mice were able to learn and remember new information," Ashe said in a telephone interview.

"No one suspected so many neurons would still be able to function."

FROM MICE TO MEN

She noted that it is a long way from treating a mouse to treating a person.

"How are we ever going to turn off the gene in humans?" Ashe asked. What might be possible, she said, would be stopping the production of the mutant proteins. And current vaccine efforts are aimed at removing the bad proteins from the brain.

"The point that makes us hopeful is the remaining neurons were functioning," she said. "When we removed the molecules that presumably were causing the malfunction, the mice were able to perform better."

Ashe said her team used a swimming maze test, in which mice must swim and find an underwater platform to stand on.

"The maze situation is very similar to parking a car in the parking lot and remembering where you parked it," she said.

William Thies, vice president for medical affairs at the Alzheimer's Association, said at the very least the mouse would be a useful tool for testing new therapies.

"It at least opens the possibility that people will get better," Thies said in a telephone interview.

The other interesting finding, Ashe said, was that the tangles of brain cells were not in themselves, evidently, toxic to surrounding brain tissue.

"The neurofibrillary tangles, which are one of two major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, turn out not to be involved in causing memory problems, at least in mice," she said.

Some process may be going on at a microscopic level, and the tangles may be a result but not a cause of the brain damage, she said.

Yale Recruits Patients For Alzheimer's Vaccine Trial

New Haven, Conn. -- July 8, 2005 -- Yale School of Medicine is recruiting patients with Alzheimer's disease to test a vaccine that appears to slow the accumulation of beta amyloid plaque in the brain.

Alzheimer's, which is marked by a progressive loss of mental ability and function, affects 4.5 million Americans.

This trial will test a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the beta-amyloid protein and that will be administered by intravenous infusion. The antibodies, while not of human origin, have been engineered to have the structure of a natural human antibody. The Phase IIa placebo-controlled study will last 27 months and will involve a total of approximately 25 visits, including six visits to the General Clinical Research Center at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

A clinical trial of an earlier vaccine was halted three years ago when several participants developed meningoencephalitis, said Christopher van Dyck, associate professor and director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Unit at Yale. The earlier trial differed by using "active" rather than "passive" vaccination. Because the new approach does not induce an active immune response--but rather administers antibodies that have already been engineered outside the body--it is believed to have much less risk of autoimmune reactions.

"The trial is based on the assumption that protecting the body's immune system against beta amyloid that builds up in Alzheimer's disease victims could slow or even prevent a disorder," van Dyck said. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease was bolstered in the late 1990s after mice bred to develop Alzheimer's-like disease were protected from beta-amyloid plaque formation and mental decline after they had been vaccinated at birth. Older mice receiving the vaccine also showed some benefit.

The earlier active vaccine, despite it's unacceptable safety profile, yielded some favorable results. Participants whose immune systems mounted a response against beta-amyloid performed significantly better on a series of memory tests than did those who received a placebo injection, according to a study in Neurology reporting the findings from the first trial.

Persons eligible to enroll in the trial have mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease and may be taking other approved treatments. To enroll or for more information please call 203-764-8100.

Crag says, "Yeah, but he's OK"
Crag says, "He works hard and he's not an idiot"
Crag says, "We like Randy"

Crag says, "The problems are HPs fault."
stormagnet says, "HP IS ALREADY ON THE LIST, THOUGH!"
stormagnet says, "Re-run fist shakings just aren't as satisfying"
stormagnet says, "Man, there is something seriously wonky with my fstab and flash"
Crag says, "I think I know what it is"
Crag says, "I think every time you plug it in it gets a new device name"
Crag says, "And you're supposed to use "autofs" or something like that to do the mounting without using the fstab"
Crag says, "Filesystems don't have to be in fstab to be mounted"
Crag says, "You can just do mount /dev/whatever /mountpoint"
Crag says, "Except you do have to be root then"
Crag says, "BUT, I think you can setup something to watch for new devices and have it create fstab entries for them"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag says, "You can check what device name gets assigned with dmesg | tail"
Crag says, "ANd if it's different from what's in your fstab, then that's the problem."
Crag says, "I think the normal desktop environment automagically does all that for you"
Crag says, "It's probably my fault that it doesn't work on your computer."
stormagnet says, "Mount still isn't working, though"
Crag says, "mount /dev/sdsomething /flash?"

stormagnet says, "Maybe nautilis is just being weird"
Crag says, "because that's who mounted it"

stormagnet says, "Is there a way I can make the device stop being busy so I can remount it?"
Crag says, "Change out of that directory, make sure no processes are in there"
Crag says, "You can see what's using it with this command"
Crag | lsof | grep /media/flash
Crag says, "And I see it's famd"
Crag says, "Which is part of your desktop"
Crag says, "See if you can right-click and unmount it"

Crag says, "You can umount it now"
Crag says, "No, it went away on its own, finally"
Crag says, "It was there when I gave you that lsof command"
Crag says, "I think the unmount attempt probably killed it"
Crag says, "success!"
Crag says, "I see your userid on the files"
stormagnet says, "ARRGH"
stormagnet says, "Still no deleting from nautilis"
stormagnet says, "meh"
Crag says, "Hm..."
Crag peers
