An on-the-record anecdote about the young Hillary bloodying the nose of a boy
in her fifth-grade class for giving away one of her baby rabbits becomes, to
Klein's thinking, evidence of a "controlling, combative" personality that
rules Clinton's personal and political behavior to this day.

Had I read Catcher in the Rye at 16 like everyone else, I might have fallen
in love with it, but at 20, I.d already dated Holden Caulfield a few times
and was sick of his shit.

On the Frontier, Homeland Security Defending Policy on Long and Short Pants

By Stephen Barr

Tuesday, June 21, 2005; Page B02

At the Department of Homeland Security, officials and union representatives are warming up for heated debate over one of summer's coolest styles -- cargo shorts.

The Federal Labor Relations Authority, in a ruling last week, ordered the department's Customs and Border Protection bureau to meet the National Treasury Employees Union at the bargaining table and negotiate over the rules for wearing cargo shorts at work.

Crag says, "what's that about?"
stormagnet  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/20/AR2005062001276.html
stormagnet can't make this shit up!
Crag says, "That's silly"
stormagnet says, "Are you calling HOMELAND SECURITY SILLY, CITIZEN?!"
stormagnet says, "Why do you hate America?"
Crag says, "because of the sand which is there."
stormagnet says, "Speaking of which..."
stormagnet says, "Go eat!"
Crag says, "yeah, ok"
Crag idles: sand which
[Idling at 11:26 A.M. on Tue, Jun 21: sand which]

stormagnet says, "COOL!"
stormagnet says, "Hey, it says it's a nonprofit, too!"
stormagnet says, "Doesn't say how much the lessons cost on the page, but if it's nonprofit, it's probably pretty affordable"
stormagnet says, "If it's not too expensive, I would like to go too ^_^"
stormagnet says, "That said, it's time for me to go do my weight lifting"
stormagnet idles: weights
Crag says, "It would help me a lot of you went too"
stormagnet says, "Oh good!!"
stormagnet looks forward to it
stormagnet says, "I got my new gym shoes"
stormagnet says, "They are 1337"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't realized how much my ankles were hurting until they STOPPED"
Crag says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm still not good at telling the difference between necessary expenses and luxuries"
Crag says, "Bruce sent me a cool link:"
Crag | http://www.iaito-katana.com/
stormagnet says, "Because I have to define 'necessary for WHAT?'"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "Yes, I have some difficulty with that balance too"
Crag says, "I can be an excellent excuse-maker at times"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "In this case, the article that lit a fire under my butt was one explaining that the reason you're supposed to replace your gym shoes so often isn't so much COMFORT as SAFETY"
stormagnet says, "Worn out gym shoes are apparently a really good way to end up with a lot of sprained ankles/knees/feet"
Crag says, "That makes sense"
Crag says, "I wouldn't have thought of that, either."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "BUT DAMN THEY IS EXPENSIVe"
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad that Sierra Outpost had clearance waiting for me in my time of need"
stormagnet says, "From now on, whenever I see good gym shoes on clearance, I will buy them. I will stock up."
stormagnet says, "BECAUSE DAMN I GO THROUGH 600 MILES FAST"
stormagnet says, "Grr."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Arooo!"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I do about 30 miles a week at the gym alone"
Crag says, "That sounds about right."
Crag says, "So two pairs of shoes per year, then."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "And a half"
Crag says, "woof"
stormagnet says, "I will wear out the left foot one year"
stormagnet says, "And the right foot the next"
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "Okay, I is stinky"

Crag says, "that's bizarre"
Crag says, "If it's true that her crying and wimpering invoked protective feelings in the lions, then that might be a good way to defend oneself from animals in the wild."
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "But it probably only works for kids."
stormagnet says, "Well, I'll have no problem with that!"
Crag says, "or something"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Aw"
Crag says, "You'd probably cry because the lion wouldn't let you give it a big ug."

Crag gives you a big ug
stormagnet says, "You totally have to read Henderson the Rain King"
stormagnet says, "Lions figure prominently"
Crag says, "And the story comes up on other news sources too"
Crag says, "It might actually be legit."
Crag says, "I'm stunned."
stormagnet says, "Oh, I'm willing to bet it's legit"
stormagnet says, "Animals are a lot more complex that just predator/prey"
Crag says, "Even so..."
stormagnet says, "And lions are famous for being family animals"
Crag says, "that's true"
Crag says, "I ain't lion to ya"
stormagnet says, "FREE SNORKEL!"
Crag says, "do. do. do. dodeedeedo. do. do."

stormagnet says, "What time do you think you'll get home tonight?"
Crag says, "Depends entirely on the library upgrade"
Crag says, "THe drives are upgraded, but the library stopped working."
stormagnet says, "Well, crap!"
Crag says, "I was hoping to leave at 3 again"
stormagnet says, "Fucking tape libraries give you no end of grief, don't they?"
Crag says, "But it doesn't look good.  I could be here late enough to keep us from visiting that doko"

Crag says, "I'm on the phone with HP now."
Crag says, "Two techs on the one, one on site."
Crag says, "I feel so special."

Crag says, "It's raining, but I'm heading out anyway"
Crag says, "I'm taking back roads."

Crag says, "I might take an hour"
stormagnet says, "There's thunder up here"
