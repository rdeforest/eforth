Waterpoint: subtle and ponderous[301]

The Dense Forest
The trees crowd around thickly, and a heavy carpet of pine needles and broken branches cover the ground.  A park bench is here.  The day is finally surrendering to the night as the light fades to the west.  It is hot and breezy.  The forest opens up into a clearing to the south.  You hear the sounds of water from an opening to the northeast.  A dark path leads a short distance west into the woods to a large, sagging wooden structure.
