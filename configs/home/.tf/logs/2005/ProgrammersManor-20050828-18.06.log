The kitty situation has progressed from worried -> concerned -> sitting back
with popcorn and laughing my ass off.

The dynamics between those two seem to be mitigated by a) Marco being just
bat-shit Siamese looney enough to enjoy being chased and b) Sancho being too
fat and lazy to do so properly.

The morning so far has consisted of Marco sneaking up close to Sancho, then
randomly tearing halfway across the room, while Sancho takes maybe two steps
and then flops back down.

Rinse. Repeat.

This gives new meaning to "cat burglar"
Tue Aug 30, 2005 11:02 AM ET

BERLIN (Reuters) - German police called to a break-in at an apartment in the northern town of Itzstedt found the intruder still on the premises and hiding under a kitchen cabinet.

The "cat burglar" had somehow crawled into the ground-floor of the apartment, broken window blinds, torn down drapes and trashed furniture.

Police also found fish and fish remains from a broken aquarium scattered around the apartment, said Julika Reinhardt, spokesman for the police in the town north of Hamburg.

Two officers finally found the offender, a cat, hiding under a kitchen cabinet but the heavyweight male resisted arrest, biting one officer in the thumb before they both managed to overpower it.

Reinhardt said the cat, wearing a name tag, was returned to its owner who would have to pay for the damage.

"No one knows how the cat broke in," she said. "But the damage was considerable."
