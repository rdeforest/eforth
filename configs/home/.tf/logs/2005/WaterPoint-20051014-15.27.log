Waterpoint: differentially overawing[309]

The Dense Forest
The trees crowd around thickly, and a heavy carpet of pine needles and broken branches cover the ground.  A park bench is here.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is hot and breezy.  The forest opens up into a clearing to the south.  You hear the sounds of water from an opening to the northeast.  A dark path leads a short distance west into the woods to a large, sagging wooden structure.

Subject:  I'm coming to visit!

I will be in the Seattle area Friday July 29 through Monday August 1.  I'd like to get together with people and do something toddler-friendly.   Mostly restaurants are not a good idea -- they are OK with restaurant eating, but not with sitting around for a long time talking.  It would be better to do something like going to a playground where we can sit around and talk and they can slide down the slides.  Someone suggested we go to a beach when I was around talking about this a few weeks ago.  Anyway, let's organize!

(Beaches in the Pacific Northwest are a great idea if you want to put your kids in cryo-storage!)

There's a good chance I will be in Seattle from Jul 3-5 while my wife is sampling travel seminars.  I'll be free for misc meals, video gaming, helping you change your oil, whatever.

Ok, I'm available for dinner tommorow anytime after 4/5pm.  I will also accept suggestions (sushi, thai, chinese a plus) near the Sharaton at 1400 6th downtown.  MOOmail by about noon Friday or call me at dinnertime 503-703-3521.  Also available for hanging out/lunch all day Saturday and dinner Saturday evening.  Vaguely planning to catch an all-digital ROTS showing Saturday eve.  Available for hanging out again on Sunday until I head home.

So my housemate's brother, with whom we are staying, says we can invite people over for dinner on Friday (the 29th).  He's planning some feast for us.  I'm not sure how many he actually intends me to invite, but I thought I'd throw it out as a possibility and see if anyone was interested.  He lives in Kenmore.

We are currently planless Monday, as well, but that might change.

I lost power around an hour ago.   The UPS failed very shortly thereafter.   It was not a clean shutdown and Waterpoint has slipped back in time to the last good checkpoint, at 1:00pm PDT.

It looks like the UPS batteries are completely dead/broken.   I'll have to order new ones.

This happened twice; the second time, I didn't change heading until the distance was positive and so successfully reached real ocean.
