stormagnet cheers
stormagnet says, "YAY burgers!"
stormagnet says, "And it's sunny and dry enough that I think I may be able to go rake leaves today"
stormagnet says, "maybe mow too?"
Crag says, "Well how about that"
Crag says, "Perhaps"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "okay, yeah"
stormagnet says, "That WAS a funny post"

Crag says, "I already bumped it up"
stormagnet CHEERS!
Crag says, "I can't decide if I want an Xbox 360 or not"
Crag says, "Especially at $400"
Crag says, "The only interesting game I've seen so far is Gun (Western by the Tony Hawk team)"
stormagnet says, "We can certainly wait and see"

stormagnet says, "The people who are making that SleepSmart thing"
stormagnet signed up on their reserve list, albeit with the stipulation of not paying more than $199
Crag says, "That sounds good"
stormagnet says, "Say, did you feed the cats this morning?"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I didn't want them to wake you up"
stormagnet thought so
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "Thank you"
Crag says, "You're welcome"
Crag says, "I've decided my next musical instrument purchase will be an acoustic bass"
Crag says, "not an upright, mind you"
Crag says, "But like a large four-string guitar"
Crag says, "Or maybe five or six string"
Crag says, "I figure I can probably get a mediocre one for around $300"
Crag says, "Especially if I shop around a lot"

Crag says, "I dunno about these miniature cookie things"
Crag . o O ( sleepy stormy! )
stormagnet says, "I overslept like crazy!"
stormagnet says, "Did you feed the cats again this morning?"
stormagnet says, "They let me sleep forever, but they're also trying to covince me that they're starving to death, now that I'm awake"
Crag says, "I didn't feed them"
Crag says, "I was feeling slightly spiteful, so I intentionally didn't feed them in hopes that they would aggrivate you. :)"
Crag says, "I feel much better now, though"
Crag says, "I think I might have blamed you for something in my dreams, but I don't remember"
Crag says, "Kindof like"
Crag says, "Paint my elephants, will she?  I'll show her!  No food for the cats!  HAHAHAHAHA!"
Crag says, "So yeah, the cats are probably very hungry"
stormagnet says, "You were talking a lot in your sleep"
stormagnet says, "It was cute, but also a little worrying"
Crag says, "I have no idea what I was dreaming"
stormagnet says, "You were probably feeling spiteful because I came to bed waaaay late with cold feet"
Crag says, "Could be"
stormagnet says, "Would you like to hang out with Nicole too?"
Crag says, "When?"
stormagnet says, "Do you have practice or anything?"
stormagnet loses
stormagnet says, "After work"
Crag says, "Next practice is tomorrow"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I could hang out tonight"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I might dominate Nicole's attention though"
Crag says, "But if that's OK with you, then sure"
stormagnet says, "That is A-OK"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag smiles.
stormagnet says, "We were planning on shopping around the thrift stores for house-type stuff for Nicole, then getting dinner"
stormagnet says, "OOH!"
stormagnet just realizes that the TJ Maxx at Northgate that Nicole wants to go to is conveniently located to THE RED ROBIN!!
stormagnet checks to make sure
stormagnet says, "It is indeed!"
Crag says, "nice"
stormagnet says, "I should bake some REAL cookies sometime soon"
stormagnet says, "Though I meant the Cookie Crisp to fall more into the trail-mix category of "small, munchie snack thing for midday""
Crag says, "They taste too artificial to me"
Crag says, "I'm turning into a health food nut!  Ack!"
stormagnet LAUGHS!!

 I can eat cornbread, but Josh can't because it has milk and I make it without sugar. 
Wild rice is great.  No potato of any kind for me :(.  Maeve and Jake can't eat them
either but Josh can and would love it.  I just make everything and put out warnings as to
which things some of us can't eat. Only Jacob can eat cane sugar so I use Maple syrup and
honey.  I will bring some with me.

 Jacob can't eat almost all fruit.  That includes palm oil, coconut of any kind including
fats, and olive oil.  The only vinegar that works is brown rice vinegar.  All citrus is
out.  I was planning to just do what we do at home and have pumpkin pie for Jacob and
fruit or mincemeat for the rest of us.  I like to make my own mincemeat at home and will
bring a jar if I get around to it.  Otherwise fruit pies are great.  Cherry pie is fun. 
There is no such thing as too much pie.  Jacob can also eat pecan pie.  I rendered my own
lard and it make really great pie crusts.

Crag says, "I talked with one of the ToonTown guys.  He sounded like he was interested in getting me into the toontown SI position."
Crag says, "If Tom makes me an offer I'm going to ask him how long I can think about it without hurting my chances. :)"
Crag says, "Ok, I'm almost done for the day"
Crag says, "What's the plan?  Do I need to pick Nicole up or anything?"
stormagnet says, "That might be a good idea- I hadn't thought that far"

stormagnet says, "ooooh"
stormagnet says, "Hey, did you feed the cats?"
Crag says, "no"
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "I think the cats think I should sleep a lot o_O"
stormagnet says, "They had me pinned down this morning"
stormagnet feeds them now
stormagnet says, "I think I'm going to have to pull an all-nighter to get my schedule back on track"
stormagnet says, "I'd been leary of doing anything that would deprive me of sleep until I was sure I had gotten over my infection"
stormagnet says, "But I just took the last antibiotic last night, and I had a seriouslie-in this morning"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "My phone interview was moved to 2pm"
stormagnet crosses fingers
stormagnet holds breath
stormagnet says, "I see you are at least properly french-toast-stick-fortified"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "Yes.  I et them all up"
Crag says, "I still have a lot of uneaten food left"
stormagnet says, "That's as it should be"
stormagnet says, "Snacks are bliss"

stormagnet says, "I swear to God, somewhere, in the office of some shady GOP think tank, is an EXTREMELY dogeared copy of 1984"
stormagnet showers
Crag says, "My goodness"
stormagnet says, "This, on the other hand, sounds fun:"
stormagnet | http://www.thestranger.com/blog/archives/2005/11/06-12.php#a002232
stormagnet was about to shower when she noticed she had email from Liz
stormagnet says, "Which I will rant about later"
stormagnet says, "AT LENGTH"
Crag says, "oh dear"
stormagnet . o O ( how the hell did 'sure you can spend the night' turn into 'sure you can spend the week', anyway? )
Crag says, "WEEK!?"
Crag says, "I still haven't heard back from SBRI yet"
Crag says, "rar"
stormagnet says, "I have to show you this email train, it's pretty priceless. I have no idea what to respond with- I keep typing things and then deleting them."
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag says, "I'm headed out shortly."
Crag says, "Will head home first, then vote, then band practice."
Crag gets email from stormy...
Crag says, "I'll have to read that at my desk."
stormagnet says, "ooh"
stormagnet says, "Sorry, I didn't see that you were headed out"
stormagnet says, "I can just show you when you get home, then"
Crag says, "Nah, I'll read i tnow"
Crag says, "ugh"
Crag says, "It got mangled by our email server"
Crag says, "I'll check them out at home"
Crag idles: homeward
[Idling at 4:07 P.M. on Tue, Nov 8: homeward]
stormagnet says, "OH!"
stormagnet says, "I forgot to mention last night"
stormagnet says, "I talked to Jeff, he's going to bring the U-Haul over Saturday afternoon"
Crag says, "Awesome"
Crag says, "I think I lost the capital one card"
Crag says, "Unless you know where it is, can you cancel it and get a replacement?"
stormagnet says, "I have it, no worries"
stormagnet says, "I used it to order the slipcover"
stormagnet says, "AND"
stormagnet says, "I think I just found the solution to our oven-size problem"
stormagnet says, "A stand-alone, programmable roaster oven"
stormagnet says, "It looks kind of like an oversized crock-pot, and Target has it on sale for $40, which is about 33% off standard retail"
stormagnet had no idea such a thing existed
stormagnet will now price check online
stormagnet says, "Crap"
stormagnet can't remember the url for that awesome price aggregator
stormagnet . o O ( not pricewatch, not priceline.... )
stormagnet says, "Well, Froogle can't find a better price"
stormagnet says, "And it's getting good reviews on the message boards that popped up"
Crag says, "Interesting"
Crag says, "I like the mobile kitchen appliance thing"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "I was hoping Bed Bath and Beyond would stock them, so I could a) take them up on their 'match any price' guarantee and b) use the gift cards, but alas1"
stormagnet says, "They do not stock them"
Crag says, "bummer"
stormagnet says, "Also not available on the website"
stormagnet may have to actually go to the brick and mortar again, AUIGH.
stormagnet says, "Yup, looks like it"
stormagnet says, "Maybe after work"
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet will call when they open and see if they'll hold one for her
stormagnet | http://www.flickr.com/photos/miss_sonia/61561556/
stormagnet . o O ( BELLY! )
stormagnet | http://products.consumerguide.com/reviews/product.epub?productId=28023
stormagnet says, "For that matter... we still have that Target credit card"
stormagnet says, "It has no balance on it, so I haven't been getting bills, but once in awhile they'll send us mail saying 'use our card! pretty please!'"
Crag says, "You're going to be a wreck by this afternoon"
Crag says, "It would be insane for you to come downtown today"
stormagnet says, "CAL ME MAD, WILL YOU?!"
stormagnet says, "I'LL SHOW YOU!"
stormagnet says, "I'LL SHOW YOU ALL!!"
stormagnet laughs maniacally
Crag says, "I rest my case"
stormagnet confirms that, yes indeedy, if she uses the Target card, there will be an additional 10% discount
Crag says, "nice"
Crag says, "Let's go shopping Tomorrow."
Crag says, "What better way to anticipate good news?"
Crag says, "Oh, and I still have plumbing madness to contend with"
Crag says, "I was thinking to pour more chemicals down more different drains to catch the various clogs through the system"
Crag says, "And also to get LOTS more root killer"
Crag says, "I was thinking to put a whole pound of root killer in the system every night before bed"
Crag says, "So it can sit and soak and KILL KILL KILL"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Scratch that, looks like the Target card died a lonely death via account inactivity"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "This is a no-raincheck, limited-quantities sale, though"
stormagnet says, "So if they say the don't do overnight holds, I'm going in"
stormagnet wonders if Target honors competitor gift cards
stormagnet . o O ( some places do )
Crag | The contracts have finally been signed and the celebration is on! The WDIG Seattle 2005 Winter Holiday Party is scheduled for Friday, December 9th at the Lake Union Cafi in Seattle. Details will follow, but be sure to get it on your calendar now!
stormagnet cheers!

stormagnet says, "More longevity goodness!"
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "Wow, the secret to dealing with Target seems to be to call right after they open"
stormagnet says, "That's when the competant people are on shift AND they have time to deal with you"
stormagnet says, "I've got a 24hr hold on (what I gather was one of the last) Rival Roaster Ovens AND a size 9 pair of those heels I still need to exchange."
stormagnet says, "Oh, dang"
stormagnet says, "I forgot to ask about competitor gift cards"
stormagnet says, "I'll just bring them with and ask when I get there"
stormagnet says, "Do you want me to meet you downtown later, or go after you get home and traffic has died down a bit?"
stormagnet says, "They're open until 10, so timing isn't much of an issue"
stormagnet says, "Or I could try bussing to the Target, and meeting you there"
Crag says, "I like that last option best of all"
stormagnet says, ":grins"
stormagnet says, "Okay, it's a plan :)"
stormagnet . o O ( I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet! )
Crag says, "Kerri and I are negotiating some sort of sippy/nibbly thing tomorrow.  I'm assuming you'll be coming along too."
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I just came up with what I think is a new expression"
Crag | It's like a needle in a needle-stack
Crag says, "or substitute 'looking for' as appropriate"
That is not a valid command.
Crag s/substitute/insert
Crag says, "So I have a question about that fatty acid in milk thing"
Crag says, "The guy is saying that animals raised in a bubble grow bigger because their bodies aren't busy fighting off attackers"
Crag says, "Do the animals' immune systems still develop correctly?  Or are they more vulnerable to attackers when they finally meet them?"
stormagnet says, "That's what the artical was addressing"
Crag says, "My eyes glaze over reading those articles"
Crag says, "I need pedestrian summaries"
stormagnet says, "Their immune systems are compromised by living in a bubble, but they grow bigger because their immune systems aren't triggered"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Um, the upshot that I was pasting it for is- the supplements I'm already taking also help treat arthritis"
Crag says, "Excellent!"
stormagnet says, "As well as helping prevent cancer, etc., but- ARTHRITIS!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Does it say anything about my consumption of half-n-half?"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "Am I saving myself from cancer and arthritis too?"
stormagnet says, "I *was* taking them because an excellent double-blind controlled study indicated that taking 3g of CLA daily, the subjects lost 3% body fat and increased their muscle mass. Which is the weight-loss holy grail, since usually losing fat also means losing muscle."
stormagnet says, "And, sort of"
stormagnet says, "The dairy and CLA are good for you, but it's still fattening, which is bad for you"
stormagnet says, "So you'd have to balance it with enough exercise to burn the excess calories before it would be a nutritional bonus"
stormagnet says, "The amounts in regular dairy are tiny trace amounts"
stormagnet says, "There's also a fair amount in ground beef, though"
stormagnet says, "It would be very, very hard to get the 3g daily that I'm taking thruogh dietary sources, though :)"
Crag says, "BEEF"
Crag says, "0xBEEF is the best hex integer ever"
stormagnet says, "this comes right on the heels of finding out that Omega-3s are also anti-inflammatory"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "0xBEEF is 48879 in decimal"
stormagnet says, "Have we passed that on the odometer yet?"
Crag says, "And 0xBEEFFEED is 3203399405"
Crag says, "Yeah, we're over 50k on the odometer"
stormagnet says, "D'OH"

Crag says, "qw() means 'quoted words', and it's shorthand for making a compile-time list of space-delimited words"

Crag says, "The first two lines do nothing because of the lines which follow them"
Crag says, "I think what they intended was @EXPORT_OK = qw($remote $used_serverName $used_portNr)"
Crag says, "But what's even MORE broken is that this EXPORT_OK is for the Exporter interface, which they're NOT ACTUALLY USING"
Crag says, "Which is why this retarded code isn't breaking anything"

The Los Angeles Times said the federal review was prompted by a complaint from a former UCI patient who had languished on the transplant list from 1998 to 2002 and ultimately underwent a transplant at another hospital.

She discovered only through a lawsuit that UCI had turned down 38 livers and 57 kidneys offered on her behalf, the newspaper said.

NICOSIA (Reuters) - A runaway ostrich that eluded police caused severe damage when it attacked a Mercedes car during a three-hour rampage.

"Somehow it got out of its pen. We sent two patrols after it, but in the meantime it caused some damage to the bonnet and bumper of a Mercedes before we caught it," a police official in Cyprus said.

The ostrich caused considerable damage when it pounced on the car, the daily Phileleftheros reported.

The ostrich is the largest of birds and can weigh at least 400 pounds. It is also the fastest creature on two legs and can run up to 43 miles per hour;

"It took us more than three hours to catch it," the police official said.

I may be 100% misogynist now. Reading the previous post my first thought was,
"That problematic thing is probably female." My next thought was, "Hey, just
kill her or smash her pretty face to shreds with a broken bottle and that'll
cure the problem." Then I realized I'm a bad person and took more Xanax.

Crag says, "The sun is the center, the soul, the self"
Crag says, "Basically I'm a sensitive, feeling, serving, all-encompassing entity"
Crag says, "And the rising sign is how we're perceived"
Crag says, "So people perceive me as protective, and relationship-oriented, especially family relationships"
Crag says, "There's a lot of relationship there"
Crag says, "Jupiter is karmic blessings"
Crag says, "Jupiter in pisces is blessing me with beneveloence in the sensitive, feeling, serving relationship stuff"
Crag says, "Which the books summarize as 'people can't help but like you'"

I would like to know about the junk puppies. The Juppies.
I'm excited.

Also, I'm awake and I have coffee. There are signs that indicate it is well
past time to clean the litterbox and scrub the bathroom floor. These signs
cannot be discussed in polite company.

stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "Two things I forgot to specify in my message:"
Crag says, "Most of today was mellow, but I keep answering the phone and regretting it :P"
stormagnet says, "1) There's no prepay penalty, so we could refinance it whenever we like, which gives us time to fix our credit rating"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet understands
stormagnet says, "2) That would get us Zippo's title back, since we're consolidating that loan with the mortgage"
Crag says, "Tell me again what the interest rate is?"
stormagnet says, "10%"
stormagnet says, "ish"
Crag says, "And are they buying the 80% loan too?"
stormagnet shakes head
Crag says, "Oh ok"
stormagnet says, "They offered to, but it wasn't as good of a deal"
Crag says, "I didn't think so"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I'm still confused though"
stormagnet says, "She tried to make me go for a package deal of 9%"
stormagnet wasn't having any of THAT nonsense
Crag says, "How can we use the house as colateral if they don't get the title for the house?"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "You're so smart!"
stormagnet says, "They're offering to refinance the mortgage"
stormagnet says, "Like we tried to do with BofA and failed"
Crag says, "Wooing you was the smartest thing I ever did in my life"
stormagnet says, "But not consolidate both mortgages"
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet blushes!
Crag says, "So they'd be buying the 20% loan then, right?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "So we'd consolidate our debts, get money for repairs, get money for wisdom teeth, AND get a lower interest rate"
Crag says, "And if we default, how do they get their money back?"
stormagnet says, "Same way any mortgage does"
Crag says, "Who gets preference between them and ocwen?"
stormagnet has no idea
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "But that's how it works"
Crag says, "It all sorta made sense to me initially when it was just one financer"
Crag says, "But maybe I misunderstood then too"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "It doesn't have to be, you just USUALLY get a better rate that way"
stormagnet says, "I think if we defaulted on either, the house would go up for auction, and they'd split the proceeds 80-20"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet says, "Mind you, that would by law require a 6 month grace period, which I daresay is longer considerably than whatever grace period we have on the Zippo loan :P"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "It sounds like a good idea to me"
Crag says, "Going from 13% to 10% can't be bad"
stormagnet says, "Well, 12%"
Crag says, "And I'd love to get Zippo back"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "right 12%"
stormagnet says, "AND losing the pre-pay penalty, so we could refinance to our heart's desire :)"
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "So if BofA comes to their senses in a few months we might even get down to 5% or something insane like that"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "Staying with Disney will clearly help with all that"
Crag says, "So that's good"
stormagnet says, "Well, in 30 days we should get two of the three bad marks on our credit stricken"
Crag says, "Great"
stormagnet says, "Because they were DAMN, DIRTY LIES"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That shit pisses me off"
stormagnet says, "And the third is simply having a high balance on the credit card, which we can also take care of"

For the better part, the Attention Deficit Disorder ADD ADHD symptom test outlined for children is about the same for the adult, with the word "work" substituted for "school." You can also look at the Attention Deficit Disorder test for children and ask yourself if, as a child, you had such symptoms or currently have such Attention Deficit Disorder symptoms.

Below is an adult symptom test with symptoms unique to the Attention Deficit Disorder adult. This self test is not a diagnostic test but a source of information for the adult trying to determine if Attention Deficit Disorder might be present in their life.

Tooth decay vaccine

November 16, 2005 - 7:45AM
http://tinyurl.com/9mhkl


Portuguese scientists said today they had developed an experimental vaccine
which has protected rats against tooth decay and could pave the way for a
version which works on humans.

"What we found is that the animals which were vaccinated with this protein
developed much smaller lesions than the control group which had not been
vaccinated," said Paula Ferreira, one of three Oporto University researchers
who worked on the vaccine.

"There is still a long road to travel (for a human version). Before that
experimental models which are closer to man need to be tested, namely in
monkeys, and for that financing is needed," she told Lisbon-based TSF radio.

Rats were used to test the experimental vaccine because the type of tooth
decay they develop is similar to that which occurs in humans, she added.

The three scientists have already patented the vaccine in Portugal and are
working on doing so in the United States where they are also seeking funding
to further their research, Ferreira said.

Tooth decay, or cavities, is one of the most common health complaints in the
world. It is caused when acids produced by bacteria that are normally present
in the mouth eat away at a tooth.

Researchers in various countries have sought to develop a vaccine which would
eliminate the bacteria that creates this acid from the mouth in order to
prevent tooth decay from forming.

sort of attribution because by the time it reached him, the fact I'd taken a
tip and posted about it had been knocked off.  Thankfully, I have many ninja
cronies helping to make sure that I get some credit for this.

I know it's sort of pathetic that I care, but I did the research, verfied the
goddamn facts, AND GET NOT A SINGLE NOD OR TIP OF THE HAT.

Bah.

The Very Best of Vin Diesel

1.Vin Diesel once walked down the street with a massive erection. There were
no
survivors.

2.Vin Diesel can win a game of Monopoly without owning any property.

3.There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Vin Diesel allows
to live.

4.If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: "I End
Lives."

5.There is no "I" in team. There are two "I"s in Vin Diesel. Fuck you, team.

6.When Vin Diesel goes to donate blood, he declines the syringe, and instead
requests a hand gun and a bucket.

7.In an average living room there are 1,242 objects Vin Diesel could use to
kill you, including the room itself.

8.Vin Diesel has always been able to find Waldo, except for one time. He found
himself stumped on the last page of Where's Waldo Now?, not being able to find
the Waldo without a shoe. He threw the book down and screamed, "This is
BULLSHIT!" They're all wearing shoes." He then proceeded to eat the book and
exclaim, "IF I CAN'T FIND WALDO, THEN NO ONE CAN!" The book he ate belonged to
a child that he had borrowed it from. The child began to cry and Vin ate him
for good measure. The incident has since been refered to as Christmas.

9.Vin Diesel is the reason why Waldo is hiding.

10.Vin Diesel once beat Super Mario Bros 3 without even touching his Nintendo
controller. He just yelled at his TV in between bites of his "Filet of Child"
sandwich, and the game beat itself out of fear.

11.Vin Diesel is the only man to ever defeat a brick wall in a game of tennis.

12.Vin Diesel has two speeds: walk and kill.

13.Vin Diesel can set ants on fire with a magnifying glass. At night.

14.When Vin Diesel jumps into a body of water, he doesn't get wet. The water
gets Vin instead.

15.Vin Diesel was the hunter who shot Bambi's Mother. He then wore her carcass
like it was a coat while he made his rounds at the local children's hospital.

16.If you were to lock Vin Diesel in a room with a guitar, a year later you
would have the greatest album ever, it would sweep the Grammy's. When asked
why
he doesn't do this Vin replied "Because Grammy's are for queers." then he ate
a
knife to show the seriousness of his response.

17.It takes 14 puppeteers to make Vin Diesel smile, but only 2 to make him
destroy an orphanage.

18.Vin Diesel played Russian Roulete with a fully loaded gun and won.

19.Vin Diesel is not lactose intolerant, he just refuses to put up with
lactose's shit.

20.When Vin Diesel was born, the nurse said, "Holy crap! That's Vin Diesel!"
Then she had had sex with him. At that point, she was the third girl he had
slept with.

21.On his birthday, Vin Diesel randomly selects one lucky child to be thrown
into the sun.

22.You are what you eat. That is why Vin Diesel's diet consists entirely of
bricks, steel, and the tears of small children.

23.In fine print at on the last page of the Guiness Book of World Records it
notes that all world records are held by Vin Diesel, and those listed in the
book are simply the closest anyone has ever come to matching him.

24.Magnetic compasses do not point toward true North - they point in the
direction of Vin Diesel. He just likes to sit on a lawn chair and shout,
"Jackets are for pussies!" at the Acrtic researchers.

25.Vin Diesel can divide by zero.

26.Not only was Vin Diesel the first to shoot a baby out of a cannon, he was
the first to eat a high velocity baby shot out of a cannon.

27.When Vin Diesel runs with scissors, other people get hurt.

28.Vin Diesel ripped out of all Charlie Brown's hair but left a single strand
to remind him one day he'd come back to eat him.

29.When Vin Diesel does a pushup, he isn't lifting himself up, he's pushing
the
Earth down.

Sunday, November 27th 2005 13:25:43, from Misha

I finally read _In the Beginning... Was the Command Line_, and enjoyed it
quite a bit.  The book makes a strange counterpoint to _Quicksilver_, through
which I am still slogging:  _Command Line_ doesn't have a -lot- to say, but
its few points are important and Stephenson makes his case clearly and --
though I lack proper motivation to put these ideas into real practice --
convincingly; but _Quicksilver_, to me, has been a quagmire of minutiae.
Three hundred pages' worth.  I guess that's why it's the Baroque Cycle,
right?  I think I get it, mostly, but so far am not liking it.

Crag says, "You are awesome"
Crag says, "And with that, I'm off"
Crag idles: not at work
[Idling at 4:00 P.M. on Sun, Nov 27: not at work]
stormagnet says, "Ugh"
stormagnet says, "Looks like we can expect to pay about 3k for electrical instead of 2k"
stormagnet says, "That awesome company I got the estimate from before?"
stormagnet says, "Apparently, a little TOO awesome for their own good"
stormagnet says, "Folded"
stormagnet *knew* she should have jumped on that one when she had the chance
Crag says, "Oh well"
Crag says, "I got free lunch at the Met today"
Crag says, "I probably cost the company about $60 today"
Crag says, "pepper corn steak"
Crag says, "delish"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME!"
stormagnet says, "Also, Reva's on MySpace, and has a blog post you MUST see"

Crag says, "Nice"
stormagnet says, "Oooh- an electrician shall be here within the hour for the first of my estimates"
stormagnet says, "First of 5"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "I won't get their estimate for a few days, but this first guy carefully took into account what parts/hardware we had already"
stormagnet says, "So all that money we dropped at the hardware store with Jeff won't go to waste"
stormagnet says, "Aaaaaaaaaand- second estimator headed over on the heels of the first."
stormagnet says, "And the first one said that the process, from estimate to job completion, should easily be finished by New Year's"
stormagnet says, "So, before I go back to school."
Crag says, "nice"
stormagnet says, "What are we doing on the 10th?"
stormagnet says, "You had an appointment of some kind?"
stormagnet says, "Dentist? Psych?"
stormagnet says, "Barb's party?"
stormagnet can't remember, can't find it on the calender
stormagnet says, "Did you deposit the CitiFinancial check yesterday, or were you going to do it on your way home today?"
stormagnet just got off the phone with Citi, reminding her that the grace period on the auto loan ends tomorrow
stormagnet says, "If it doesn't post by tomorrow, we should probably just drop off a check for a regular payment"
Crag says, "10th is barb's party"
Crag says, "9th is company party"
Crag says, "Dentist is the 1st"
Crag says, "I did not deposit the check, will do it after I get home"
Crag says, "It's in your purse right now"
Crag says, "I'm sure it won't post tomorrow, we'll have to drop off a check"
stormagnet says, "Okay :)"
stormagnet says, "Your dentist apointment, or mine?"
stormagnet vaguely remembers mention of a follow up appointment at the oral surgeons, but can't pull the specifics out of the haze
Crag says, "Mine"
Crag says, "Yours is..."
Crag says, "the 8th at noon"
Crag says, "You want to come to the bank with me when I make the deposit?"
Crag says, "Not necessarily, but no harm in asking either"
stormagnet says, "I think I'll need to stay home"
stormagnet says, "Electrician still isn't here yet, so I might still be busy with the estimate then"
Crag says, "k"
stormagnet says, "We have lots of anime downloaded for later, btw :)"
Crag says, "great"
Crag says, "I've got practice tonight"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Okay"
Crag says, "But I'm completely free tomorrow night"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "After my appointment w/ Dr. Wood I mean"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "SO BUSY"
Crag hugs!

Hi Louisa,

I just dropped Emiko and her Certic hut at school. I am very thankful of
you for helping Emiko to get started with the very solid foundation. I
have been dreading this 3rd grade project as I saw all the fancy works
parents put together for their children every year.  Emiko's was
probably the only one which can be truthfully said to be built by a 3rd
grader. Thank you.

Crag says, "That's pretty cool that Shinya sent that"
Crag says, "He's so reserved, that it must REALLY mean a lot to him"
Crag says, "Sunday still conflicts with work for me"
Crag says, "But we can talk about it when I get home"
Crag idles to hurry home soon

Crag says, "So I've been browsing throught that http://www.childsupermodels.com/ site that was posted on Junk and squicked some junkies out..."
Crag says, "Is it bad that I want to defend the site?"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll feel differently when Dr. Wood finds the correct medication and dosage."
Crag says, "And I'd probably have a completely different take on it if I had grown up as an early-blooming girl with scary guys leering at me all the time."
Crag says, "But I'm not sure"
Crag signs
