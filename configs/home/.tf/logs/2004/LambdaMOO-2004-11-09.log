Hi, I'm noticing that #102386:expire_old_messages doesn't seem to be working - is this because of the network issue? Thanks

New modem has arrived from Speakeasy.
New modem appears to actually work.  
Dslreports tells me my connection speed is about 100K faster on the upload speed than the old modem; or maybe that was just a testing fluke.  
Whatever.

Now I just have to replace my ad hoc filter wiring that's currently just dangling out of the box on the side of the house with the box cover open and flapping in the breeze.  And then we'll be good to go.

> Too bad Covad messed up so thoroughly.

I'm somewhat confused by this.  I thought Covad did the actual installations for Speakeasy.
