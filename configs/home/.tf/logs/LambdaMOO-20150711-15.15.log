PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

For assistance either now or later, type `help'.

Storage room
Boxes, crates scrapes of stuff, and the desicated remains of a rat are all strewn about this small room. There is dusteverywhere... at least you hope that's dust. There's a hammock strung between two walls and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light.

You note that the 60 watt incandescent bulb implies that the owner ther doesn't care about the environment, or hasn't changed anything since incandescent lights became hard to come by.
There is new activity on the following list:
