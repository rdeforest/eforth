The Front Parlour
A room set aside for receiving callers of a more general or unexpected variety. Well appointed, but its formality renders it a bit impersonal.  An oriental rug lies soft underfoot.  A bureau a gradin stands off to the side of the room.  A desk chair is pulled up next to the desk.  A sideboard stands against the wall next to the doors to the foyer.  Across the room, some setees are drawn up in a semi-circle around a tea table.  Opposite the settees, a large marble fireplace occupies the eastern wall. In front of the hearth are a pair of wingback armchairs, with a small occasional table between them.

DELETE
======

Syntax:  delete <line-number> from <note>

Removes a single line of text from a note.  The first line of text is numbered 1, the second is 2, and so on.  Only the owner of a note may do this.

-----
LISTDELETE()
============

Syntax:  listdelete (list <list>, int <index>)   => list

Returns a copy of <list> with the <index>th element removed.  If <index> is not in the range `[1..length(<list>)]', then `E_RANGE' is raised.

    x = {"foo", "bar", "baz"};
    listdelete(x, 2)   =>   {"foo", "baz"}

=> 2

`HELP TASKID' NOT FOUND
=======================

Sorry, but no help is available on `taskid'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

-----
TASK_ID()
=========

Syntax:  task_id ()   => int

Returns the non-zero, non-negative integer identifier for the currently-executing task.  Such integers are randomly selected for each task and can therefore safely be used in circumstances where unpredictability is required.

`HELP ADDMESSAGE' NOT FOUND

`HELP ADD-MESSAGE' NOT FOUND

`HELP MESSAGE' AMBIGUOUS
========================

Sorry, the topic `message' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help message-sequences'[1]                     `help messages'[2]
`help @messages'[3]     

-----
MESSAGES
========

Most objects have messages that are printed when a player succeeds or fails in manipulating the object in some way.  Of course, the kinds of messages printed are specific to the kinds of manipulations and those, in turn, are specific to the kind of object.  Regardless of the kind of object, though, there is a uniform means for listing the kinds of messages that can be set and then for setting them.

The '@messages' command prints out all of the messages you can set on any object you own.  Type `help @messages'[1] for details.

To set a particular message on one of your objects use a command with this form:

        @<message-name> <object> is "<message>"

where '<message-name>' is the name of the message being set, <object> is the name or number of the object on which you want to set that message, and <message> is the actual text.

For example, consider the 'leave' message on an exit; it is printed to a player when they successfully use the exit to leave a room.  To set the 'leave' message on the exit 'north' from the current room, use the command

        @leave north is "You wander in a northerly way out of the room."

[Note to programmers: This class of commands automatically applies to any property whose name ends in '_msg'.  Thus, in the example above, the command is setting the 'leave_msg' property of the named exit.  You can get such a command to work on new kinds of objects simply by giving the appropriate properties names that end in '_msg'.  Additionally, in many cases the _msg property is accompanied by a _msg verb, which defaultly returns the named property, but which is available to be customized in more complex ways than allowed by simple string substitution.  You should check for the particular property you're considering whether the verb form exists (typically with @list).]

The following help topics describe the uses of the various messages available on standard kinds of objects:

container-messages[2]
      the messages on objects that can contain other objects
exit-messages[3]
      the messages on exit objects
thing-messages[4]
      the messages on objects that can be taken and dropped

-----
@MESSAGES
=========

Syntax:  @messages <object>

List all of the messages that can be set on the named object and their current values.  See `help messages'[1] for more details.

$YOU:SAY_ACTION
===============

$you:say_action(message [,who [, thing[, where[, dobj[, iobj]]]]]).

announce 'message' with pronoun substitution as if it were just 

  where:announce_all($string_utils:pronoun_sub(message, who, thing, where, dobj, iobj)); 

except that all involved parties get modified messages, with the appropriate use of 'you' instead of their name.

who   default player

thing default object that called this verb

where default who.location

Any of these may be lists, of the form {<list of objs>, @<args to $string_utils:english_list>}.

`HELP SLEEP' NOT FOUND
======================

Sorry, but no help is available on `sleep'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

SUSPEND()
=========

Syntax:  suspend ([int <seconds>])   => value

Suspends the current task, and resumes it after at least <seconds> seconds.  (If <seconds> is not provided, the task is suspended indefinitely; such a task can only be resumed by use of the `resume()' function.)  When the task is resumed, it will have a full quota of ticks and seconds.  This function is useful for programs that run for a long time or require a lot of ticks.  If <seconds> is negative, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  `Suspend()' returns zero unless it was resumed via `resume()', in which case it returns the second argument given to that function.

In some sense, this function forks the `rest' of the executing task.  However, there is a major difference between the use of `suspend(<seconds>)' and the use of the `fork (<seconds>)'.  The `fork' statement creates a new task (a "forked task") while the currently-running task still goes on to completion, but a `suspend()' suspends the currently-running task (thus making it into a "suspended task").  This difference may be best explained by the following examples, in which one verb calls another:

    .program   #0:caller_A
    #0.prop = 1;
    #0:callee_A();
    #0.prop = 2;
    .

    .program   #0:callee_A
    fork(5)
      #0.prop = 3;
    endfork
    .

    .program   #0:caller_B
    #0.prop = 1;
    #0:callee_B();
    #0.prop = 2;
    .

    .program   #0:callee_B
    suspend(5);
    #0.prop = 3;
    .

Consider `#0:caller_A', which calls `#0:callee_A'.  Such a task would assign 1 to `#0.prop', call `#0:callee_A', fork a new task, return to `#0:caller_A', and assign 2 to `#0.prop', ending this task.  Five seconds later, if the forked task had not been killed, then it would begin to run; it would assign 3 to `#0.prop' and then stop.  So, the final value of `#0.prop' (i.e., the value after more than 5 seconds) would be 3.

Now consider `#0:caller_B', which calls `#0:callee_B' instead of `#0:callee_A'.  This task would assign 1 to `#0.prop', call `#0:callee_B', and suspend.  Five seconds later, if the suspended task had not been killed, then it would resume; it would assign 3 to `#0.prop', return to `#0:caller_B', and assign 2 to `#0.prop', ending the task.  So, the final value of `#0.prop' (i.e., the value after more than 5 seconds) would be 2.

A suspended task, like a forked task, can be described by the `queued_tasks()' function and killed by the `kill_task()' function.  Suspending a task does not change its task id.  A task can be suspended again and again by successive calls to `suspend()'.

By default, there is no limit to the number of tasks any player may suspend, but such a limit can be imposed from within the database.  See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.

Returns a non-zero integer (i.e., a true value) if <object> is a valid object (one that has been created and not yet recycled) and zero (i.e., a false value) otherwise.

    valid(#0)    =>   1
    valid(#-1)   =>   0


In almost all cases, you really want to be using $recycler:valid(), which behaves the same as valid() but additionally returns false if the object is $garbage.

-----
TASK_ID()
=========

Syntax:  task_id ()   => int

Returns the non-zero, non-negative integer identifier for the currently-executing task.  Such integers are randomly selected for each task and can therefore safely be used in circumstances where unpredictability is required.

TASK_STACK()
============

Syntax:  task_stack (int <task-id> [, <include-line-numbers>])   => list

Returns information like that returned by the `callers()' function, but for the suspended task with the given <task-id>; the <include-line-numbers> argument has the same meaning as in `callers()'.  Raises `E_INVARG' if <task-id> does not specify an existing suspended task and `E_PERM' if the programmer is neither a wizard nor the owner of the specified task.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $CODE_UTILS[1]
=====================================

parse_propref("foo.bar")  => {"foo","bar"} (or 0 if arg. isn't a property ref.)
parse_verbref("foo:bar")  => {"foo","bar"} (or 0 if arg. isn't a verb ref.)
parse_argspec("any","in","front","of","this","baz"...)
                          => {{"any", "in front of", "this"},{"baz"...}} 
                                           (or string if args don't parse)

tonum(string)           => number (or E_TYPE if string is not a number)
toobj(string)           => object (or E_TYPE if string is not an object)
toerr(number or string) => error value (or 1 if out of range or unrecognized)
error_name(error value) => name of error (e.g., error_name(E_PERM) => "E_PERM")

verb_perms()    => the current task_perms (as set by set_task_perms()).
verb_location() => the object where the current verb is defined.
verb_documentation([object,verbname]) => documentation at beginning of
           verb code, if any -- default is the calling verb

check_syntax(lines) => what set_verb_code() would return for the source in lines
disassemble_code(lines) => {1, disassemble() results} or {0, set_verb_code() results}

   Preposition routines

prepositions()     => full list of prepostions
full_prep ("in")   => "in/inside/into"
short_prep("into") => "in"
short_prep("in/inside/into") => "in"
get_prep  ("off", "of", "the", "table") => {"off of", "the", "table"}

   Verb routines

verbname_match (fullname,name) => can `name' be used to call `fullname'
find_verb_named          (object,name[,n]) => verb number or -1 if not found
find_callable_verb_named (object,name[,n]) => verb number or -1 if not found
find_verbs_containing (pattern[,object|objlist])

verbs(object) => (partial) list of verbs on the object

   Verbs that do the actual dirty work for @show:

show_object  (object)
show_property(object,propname)
show_verbdef (object,verbname)

   Dirty work for explain_syntax

explain_verb_syntax(thisname,verbname,@verbargs)

   A random but useful verb

verb_or_property(object,name[,@args]) => result of verb or property call,
                                         or E_PROPNF

   Player manipulation:
connected_players()   =>   returns all actual players connected
players()             =>   returns all actual players

   Regular Expressions for parsing code
no_open_quotes_regexp => a regexp that matches a moo-code line with all strings properly closed

`HELP KILL' AMBIGUOUS
=====================

Sorry, the topic `kill' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help @kill'[1]         `help kill_task()'[2]   

-----
@KILL
=====

Syntax:  @kill task_id
         @kill [object]:[verb]
         @kill soon [number-of-seconds]
         @kill all
         @kill %trailing_id


Immediately kills one or more forked tasks.  The '@forked' command is useful for finding out what tasks you have pending; see `help @forked'[1] for details.  Only the owner of a task may kill it.

@kill task_id kills only the task with that id.

@kill object:verb kills all tasks which were scheduled by the object running the verb named.  Both object and verb are optional:  @kill object: kills all tasks scheduled by that object, and @kill :verb kills all tasks which were scheduled by any object running that verb.  This can be useful if you have several similar objects which are running tasks from similarly named verbs.  (Perversely, @kill : kills all tasks...  Any object running any task.)

@kill soon kills all tasks scheduled within the next minute.  @kill soon number kills all tasks scheduled within that number of seconds, e.g. @kill soon 300 would kill all tasks scheduled within the next five minutes.  This can be useful if you have a runaway task you want to quickly remove, but don't want to kill you later tasks.

@kill all kills all tasks.  Like @kill soon, but more dramatic.

@kill %trailing_id expects you to specify the last few digits of a task id.  It then kills all tasks that end with those digits.

Example:
  @forked
  1359083655  Sep 16 21:45:00 1991  yduJ          #5803:heartbeat (10) [#68]
