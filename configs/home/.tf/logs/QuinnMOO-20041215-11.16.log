Crag's slope
This area is a mostly level part of what would be a fairly steep rocky incline.  Most of the stones are bare.  A few have moss growing in their shade.  Looking out and down, a broad landscape of forests, mountains, fields and streams is visible.  To the left and right the slope is too steep to be safe.
You see Crag's Solid Stone Class Container here.

MintyCandyCane enters the room carrying a small sample of erotic oils and lotions.  Then she whispers, 'Take off your clothes and lay down,' to you.  You eagerly comply.
Starting at your feet and working her way up, you become more and more relaxed as MintyCandyCane sensuously caresses every part of your glistening body.
Crag hugs!
MintyCandyCane continues to massage you with her small collection of exotic oils.  First she works your calves, and then carefully works her way up to your thighs.
Next she moves up to the very lowest regions of your back.  The feeling of her baby soft fingers is exciting you.
MintyCandyCane rubs your back, meticulously working her way up to your shoulders.  You are much more relaxed now.  When she is finished, MintyCandyCane slowly leans over and gives you a gentle kiss on the lips.
