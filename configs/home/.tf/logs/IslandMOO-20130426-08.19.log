The Northern Entrance
An elevated portico framing the main entrance at the northern front of the Manor. A flight of marble stairs leads down to the northern drive, and a smaller flight to the west leads to the port-cochere.  A pair of massive oak double doors bar the entrance, inscribed with the family crest.  Through the tracery windows, you can catch a glimpse of the vestibule inside.
