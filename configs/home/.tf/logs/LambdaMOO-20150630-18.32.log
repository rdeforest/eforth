Subject:  mud.el

FWIW, my mud-mcp.el works for Emacs 24.  To be sure, the code is mostly about implementing a MCP 2.1 interface [and thus pointless for LambdaMOO] but there are about 100 lines of code down at the end (scroll down to "comint.el support ... el cheapo mud.el") that implement a mud mode on top of comint (which I did because I got tired of dealing with the idiosyncracies of mud.el and also comint was sort of the "modern" way to do things 13 years ago).  Anyway, that's all here if you just want to get up and running in Emacs 24:

  http://www.ipomoea.org/mcp  

scroll down to "Emacs Lisp"; the first file (mud-mcp.el) suffices, though if you connect to Waterpoint or other such places then you'll want the other two.  And then it's M-x mud-mcp-connect, which creates a comint mode buffer, and as long as you have done a 

   (defconst mud-sites '("LambdaMOO" MOO "lambda.moo.mud.org" 8888) ...)

somewhere, just as for mud.el, you're off to the races.

Subject:  systemd

So, having now upgraded to Debian 8 (jessie) I now see there's this thing called systemd which has taken over just about everything.  And I'm now wondering if anybody's looked at having the MOO server use socket activation.

Or is there something I'm missing about why this would be a horribly bad idea?

Socket activation will defer the launching of the moo until the first connection request comes in. So your system ought to boot up faster. But I imagine that all the people out there with auto-reconnecting clients will connect to you within a minute or two of booting anyway and cause the launch then.

>  To what end?

The two wins that occur to me (there might be others) are

(1) making it possible to connect pretty much the moment the machine boots.  There is of course, *some* delay in waiting for the actual server to start and read its db file, but that's pretty damn fast these days.  In other words, if we *know* we're going to be starting a server, then barring some kind of server bug, there's no reason not to just grab the port right away, at which point you can just connect and you're done -- you don't have to keep retrying -- and then, once the server comes up, it's life as before.

(2) getting rid of a couple layers of shell scripts.  It's one thing if you're not sure about how you want to set things up and thus need to remain flexible; it's quite another if you've been doing things the same way for 15 years and you're just copying boilerplate code from all of your other services because there's nothing you're doing that's really THAT different from what, e.g., a webserver or a mail server has to do...

.. or, worse, when you've got AD HOC code that is basically doing the same things, but is different because it has to deal with a LambdaMOO server executable that was written 25 years ago prior to various modern conventions about the right way to administer servers.  (...e.g., why the f--- do we have to pass all of our network configuration on the command line [where it can get garbled by the shell]; surely there can be a config file that the server reads on startup, which specifies logfiles, listening ports, IP addresses, unix sockets, [speaking of which, why can't the same server executable do ALL of TCP sockets, UNIX sockets AND have a single-user mode?  Postgresql does this just fine; and it's really NOT the security measure that Pavel thought it was], outbound connection rules [not just on vs. off -- that separate iptables config for MOO needs to go away; anyway didn't Apache already solve this problem [and of course completely changed their solution in 2.4; yay...]], etc... ) 

.. and of course every time yduJ connects she's all "buh, how do I do X; fuck, I have to read all of these README files" because we don't use any of the (now) standard interfaces for, say, starting and stopping services.

In other news I am generally appalled at how fast Debian 8 boots (or at least how fast it boots when it doesn't have to fsck).

I don't find much value in 1), I think socket activation makes things overly complex for long-running services that have massive saved state.  Socket activation" is the contemporary equivilent of inetd's "wait" functionality (which was very rarely used with TCP services).  So you can connect as soon as the machine is up, but you're still not able to do anything until the actual service is running. Some jackass a while ago got the smart idea to use socket activation for mysql and that resulted in a massive series of race conditions and bugs (especially when mysql was used for local account resolution). There's very little reason to use socket activation on long running services, especially when the service is the primary reason the machine exists anyway.  It adds complexity to what should be a simple process.  You'd also have to modify the moo server to accept a listening socket from its parent (I don't know off hand if this was added).

If you want to solve 2), then just create a .service file that runs the LambdaMOO server in the foreground, and then you can get rid of all your shell scripts.
