Binder says, "Yo yo yo."
Crag says, "Howdy"
Binder says, "How's it going?"
Crag says, "I've got a bit of a cold, I think"
Crag says, "It's just a funny feeling in my throat right now"
Crag says, "But it's been building for weeks"
Crag says, "DEATH COLD 2006"
Binder says, "Allergies?"
Crag says, "I haven't had them before, but who knows"
Crag says, "I think it's more likely to be a psychosomatic reaction to stress"
Binder says, "What's stressing you?"
Crag says, "Deadline I missed last month"
Crag says, "It's not logical stress, either"
Crag says, "There are no reprecussions to fear, my bosses are still very happy with me"
Crag says, "I have unfinished business"
Crag says, "At the end of June my boss and I agreed to talk about the whole thing later when I had gotten some sleep (I'd been up all night).  Since then she's been out sick and on vacation."
Binder says, "So still unresolved and possibly unresolvable."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "It's hard to have a constructive perspective about situations one has no external control over"
Binder says, "Yeah.  Sometimes better to just let them go."
Crag says, "possibly always"
Crag says, "But, easier typed than done."
Binder says, "True."
Binder says, "But not much to be done about it, other than to relax."
