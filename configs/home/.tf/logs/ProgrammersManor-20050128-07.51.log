The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  You are sitting on it.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.

Minty says, "Ohhhh"
Minty says, "So ya chatted wif her?"
You say, "Just a little"

You say, "nah"
Minty says, "ahh"
You say, "I have a job lead in California"

Minty says, "I thought you were in Calif already?"
Minty says, "Cool!"
You say, "I've been in Seattle for over three years."
Minty says, "Ohhhh"
Minty says, "duh me"
Robert grins.
Minty giggles.
You say, "I used to be in California."
Minty says, "I was sooooo surprised that you answered my email so quickly!"
You say, "It was kinda just chance."
You say, "I only check my mail every other day now"
You say, "I just happened to check it at the right time."
Minty says, "Ahhh, coz normally, I'm not that lucky ;)"
Minty nods.
You say, "Stick with me and you'll get lucky all the time!"
Minty yays!
Minty giggles.
Minty says, "Ok, so these people that are coming here would like to have prog bits."
You say, "Certainly"
Minty says, "enceladus, Marcy, kirsty and Babs."
Minty says, "BUT!"
You say, "I want to switch back to the Programmer's Manor DB first though"
Robert . o O ( but )
Minty says, "Babs has a hard time getting in here, she got in and didn't know it.. but then she tried it again, and it told here that someone was already using that name."
Minty <-- slow typer.
You say, "Ah"
You say, "Does she want her password reset then?"
You say, "And what kind of hard time is she having?  SLow connection or something?"
Minty says, "So, I tried using a different name, I used Suzie, and I made it in alright."
You say, "Hm"
You say, "I saw that someone created users named 'user' and 'name'"
Minty says, "It told her that someone else was using the name babs."
Minty says, "That was Babs"

You say, "Alright"
You say, "I'll delete Babs, user and name, and she can re-create herself"
Minty says, "She tried using a password too, and I think she said that it said the pass was invalid or something."
Minty says, "Ahh, okies"
You say, "She'll have to create herself again when we go back to the other db anyway"
Minty says, "All of us will?"
You say, "In fact, I'll just leave it at that"
You say, "Nom not everyone"
You say, "Just the people who weren't in the old db"
Minty says, "Ahhh"
You say, "You and Marcy were in it"
Minty nods.
You say, "This is the stabby MOO"
You say, "the one I thought I lost"
Minty says, "Ohhh"
You say, "We found it :)"
Minty says, "what do you mean by stabby?"
You say, "You don't remember the rampant stabbing?"
Minty says, "which one?"
You say, "Binder wrote knife code"
Minty says, "Ohhhhh!  Yes!"
You say, "Where people could stab each other"
Minty nods.
You say, "That's the DB I'm restoring tomorrow."
Minty says, "Ahh, gotcha"
Minty says, "Oh, and lag here was terrible yesterday."
You say, "Complete with three-story manor, fountain, ballroom, etc"
You say, "Hm"
Minty says, "Coolies!"
You say, "I don't know why that would be..."
Minty says, "Probably a routing problem."
You say, "Maybe I should setup some kind of traceroute page for people to check their connection with."
Robert shrugs.
Minty grins.
Minty says, "Oh, did you still want to make me a wiz?"
Minty . o O ( eek! )
You say, "Certainly."
Minty gulps.
You say, "In fzact"
You say, "I'll make you a wiz now so you can read the help before I restore the other db"

You say, "Ok, you're a wizard now"
Minty gasps!
Minty says, "I am?"
Minty faints.
You say, "So the only commands you'll ever need are @programmer and @quota"
Minty laughs.
Minty says, "Ahhh"
You say, "@programmer gives people prog bits (surprise)"
You say, "And @quota grants quota"
Minty nods.
You say, "You can check out the help on the commands, but it should be pretty self-explanatory"
Minty says, "Ok"
Minty says, "Where do I check them out?"
You say, "Just type 'help @programmer' or 'help @quota'"

Minty says, "I think I would be better off copying and pasting all that to an email to myself.. that way, I can print it out, then I'd have it handy."
Minty nods.

Minty yays!
You say, "I do some faith in you, yes."

Minty whews!
Minty laughs.
You say, "Mostly I expect the MOO to be obtuse enough that you'd have to really WANT to break things to do so."
Minty says, "Well, sometimes I'm not too sure on some things, and I take a chance.. but I'll try not to screw things up."

Minty sighs.
You say, "In fact, the old db might still have it"

Minty growls.
You say, "weird"
Minty nods.
You say, "I just don't get why that would amuse him"

@BLACKLIST
==========

Syntax:  @redlist   [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]
         @blacklist [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]
         @graylist  [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]

Syntax:  @unredlist   [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]
         @unblacklist [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]
         @ungraylist  [<domain or subnet> [commentary]]

With no argument, the current contents of the <color>list are printed.
Otherwise, the specified domain or subnet is added to or removed from the list and mail will be sent to $site_log.  

If the given domain or subnet has subdomains/subsubnets that are already on the list, you will be prompted as to whether you want to remove them.  Note that adding an entry for a particular domain or subnet effectively adds all subdomains/subsubnets, so unless there's some reason for keeping an explicit entry for a particular subdomain, chances are you will indeed want to remove them.  One reason to keep an explicit entry for a subdomain would be if you intended to unlist the full domain later but wanted to be sure you didn't unlist the subdomain in the process.

See `help blacklist'[1] for a description of the functions of these <color>lists.

Minty nods.
Minty says, "I believe he's truely a psycho."
You say, "THe commands for blocking people by site are @redlist, @blacklist and @graylist"
You say, "in case something like that comes up"
Minty says, "Ahh, I saw that when I checked wiz-index"
Robert nods.
Minty says, "But lots of people don't go there anymore, and if they do, it's only for a short time."
You say, "Maybe that's why people do those things"
Minty says, "And that's really sad, coz it used to be sooooo fun to go there."
Minty nods.
You say, "Maybe they get a feeling of control by driving nice people off"
Minty says, "Yep"
Minty says, "Well, when they find themselves all  alone there.. too bad."
You say, "There's always another place to go"
Minty says, "Yep"
Minty says, "Oh, enceladus made his own moo too, so I've been going there.  He just made it the other night."
You say, "Those people are probably too sane to be committed but not sane enough to be socially adjusted."
Minty says, "Exactly!"
You say, "Heh, making a MOO is pretty easy. :)"

Minty wouldn't know.
Minty laughs.
You say, "On my server it's one command to get it started."

Minty tries to get used to things.
Minty nods.
You say, "So there's an adjustment period for programmers used to Lambda"
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "But I think it makes more sense"
Minty nods.
You say, "For example:"
You say, "In Lambda MOO it takes three functions to announce something different to the actor, victim and other people in the room."
Minty says, "wow!"
You say, "In Waterpoint core it takes one: $you:say_action"
Minty says, "Cool!"

Minty nods.
