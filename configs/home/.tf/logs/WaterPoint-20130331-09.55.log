Subject:  $exit:sweep_for_followers causes a WAIF to be passed to :accept

Ragnar touched a linking book with JoD following him. As a result he got this traceback:

#7136:acceptable (this == #6803), line 2:  Type mismatch
... called from #1:accept (this == #6803), line 1
... called from #7:move (this == #5700), line 16
... called from #7:sweep_for_followers (this == #5700), line 18
... called from #7:move (this == #5700), line 36
... called from #7:invoke (this == #5700), line 4
... called from #7016:touch enter (this == #6749), line 10
(End of traceback)

The problem is that line 17 of $exit:sweep_for_followers creates a group WAIF and passes it to $exit:move, which then calls :accept on the destination with the group WAIF as argument. This breaks :accept implementations which assume the argument passed will be an object.

I think $exit ought to call :accept individually on each member of the group.

When you get a traceback with a raise()'d error code, it's difficult to tell what kind of error it is to catch it later. For a short example try $http:get("blah"). It tells you "Invalid URL" but not that it's an E_INVARG error.

Subject:  $string_utils:space(-len, fill) not working as advertised

According to the documentation for $string_utils:space(len, fill): "If len is negative, fill is anchored on the right instead of the left."

However, this effect is negated by the line:

 7: if ((n = abs(n)) > 100000)

A fix is nontrivial but straightforward. Some parts of the verb depend on `n' being positive (lines 14-15, 19). I suggest changing the argument name to `len' and setting n = abs(len) on line 7, then replacing references to `n' with `len' on lines 4-5 and 24.

Seconded!  And, there should be some NLP built into the MOO to automatically set the topic sign by tracking the topic of actual conversation threads.

Also, there should be a pony.  A pony that doesn't bite.

Presumably this is because of a quota issue but the traceback should probably not have occured. Rather, the verb likely needs to be -d and do something like "Curiously, %t rebounds sharply off the %d with no apparent affect." (with the correct variables, of course.)

Well, I did something like this with the Spontaneous Combustion Feature, and I ended up needing a FAQ item because people weren't connecting the change in effect to quota problems.  So I think maybe a traceback is called for.

Now, maybe it ought to trace back before printing the 'ground to dust' message.  I could totally buy that... I'll try to do that when I get the chance.

I mean, unless somebody seconds the 'no traceback' position in the meantime ...

 I read 727 on *Bug-reports and decided to see if it was fixed.
walk to nearest river --- yielded output:
 You don't know of any way to get from here to the generic river room.
but the command: walk to nearest riv
yielded a walk to a series of rooms that ended with Splash!
 You have arrived.
 just in case someone wants to try to find out what happened
I ended up in  The River Eddies (in the water) ie: #736
 which is a child of generic water room (#414)
so my bug is slightly different, in that if I walk TO a river, I don't actually
expect to end up IN the river.

The reason that the generic river room matches is that the search is on leaves($room) and there are no kids of #1818.  It has the exact alias 'river' while 'river eddies' #736 only has that as a prefix.

MAIL
====

The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from other players.  It provides commands to view and manage your own collection of saved messages and, in addition, to browse through other collections that may be available (e.g.,archives of public mailing lists).  Help is available on the following commands:

@mail       [1]
      seeing a table of contents for a collection of email messages
@read       [2]
      reading individual messages 
@next       [3]
      reading the 'next'     message
@prev       [4]
      reading the 'previous' message

@send       [5]
      composing and sending a message to other players
@answer     [6]
      replying to one of the messages in a collection
@forward    [7]
      resending one of the messages in a collection somewhere else
@forward-me [8]
      resending a message to your email address

@rmmail     [9]
      discarding some subset of a collection
@unrmmail   [10]
      undoing the most recent @rmm on a collection
@renumber   [11]
      renumbering the messages in a collection

@mail-option[12]
      describing and setting various customization flags

For viewing collections other from your own, the following commands are useful:

@rn         [13]
      list those collections that have new messages on them
@subscribe  [14]
      indicate that you want @rn to report on a given collection and add yourself to its .mail_notify list
@skip       [15]
      ignore any remaining new messages in a given collection
@unsubscribe[16]
      ignore a given collection entirely from now on and remove yourself from its .mail_notify list

Two other related topics:

mail-forwarding[17]
      describes mail forwarding
message-sequences[18]
      describes message-sequences arguments to @mail, @read, @rmm, and @answer.

Unfortunately, fixing this required writing a new section or two on pronoun-sub parsers so readers would have some idea what a "$pronoun_sub.two_letter:parse()" was doing there.

Fortunately, I wrote them.  I also fixed the earlier example with the sun, including the typo it contained.

Hopefully, the new sections make the document less confusing.  They do seem to lose some of the focus, though, and delay getting into examples, and that makes me worry.

I think the reason it does is a reluctance to encourage slorping large, inconvenient to manipulate binary objects into the MOO.  It's true, though, a hardwired Accept is probably not the way to enforce this.

Besides binaryness, not every text object is one of {text/html, text/ascii, text/plain}. Oh, and text/ascii is as far as I know not part of any standard.

There is a recent trend to not use text/* but rather application/* because text/* is specified with some unfortunate encoding default, and modern designs want to use UTF-8 by default.

Examples:
application/xml
application/json
image/svg+xml

Anyway, the disastrousness-for-some-applications of this would be reduced by revising the header produced:
Accept: text/html, text/plain, text/*;q=0.95, */*;q=0.90

This would avoid our hardwired list causing servers to return 406 Not Acceptable.

$http:get_now and :get_now_b now only send their static Accept: headers if the extra_hdrs do not contain any Accept: headers.

afaict, :get_now_b should just replace :get_now and then further be enhanced to always use a binary mode connection and then when binary=0 it should unbinary the response for the caller.  Otherwise HTTP responses that don't end in a newline get truncated.

Subject:  libevent

Currently the LambdaMOO server uses a homegrown abstraction mechanism to abstract over network sockets and event polling mechanisms.  Of the mechanisms available in various OSes and flavors of *nix, only poll(2) and select(2) are currently supported.  Some configuration, in theory at least, is done by hand.  MOO also uses the standard UNIX DNS resolver, in a separate process to keep it from stalling the server.

libevent, for those who don't know, is a library offering an abstraction over network sockets and event polling mechanisms.  It is available for a number of common flavors of *nix (including Mac OS X) as well as Windows.  It configures itself.  It supports modern high-efficiency polling mechanisms as well as the old standbys and is actively maintained.  It includes a builtin asynchronous dns resolver.  The license is 3-clause BSD.  See <http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/> for details.

Would it be worth creating a dependency (or alternately, an inclusion) in order to use libevent as the network and polling abstraction mechanism (and DNS resolver) in LambdaMOO?

I confess to having considered modifying the server to replace its network abstraction with libevent.   Does anyone, anywhere even use the non-multiplexed-TCP networking variants?  I don't remember now what I wanted to do that the current abstraction made hard that prompted me to think this was a good idea, though.

libevent is nice.

(...or maybe 1.8.4 or maybe 1.9.0 prerelease?  buh...
    Anyway I posted this on *Server@LM about
    my recent hacking binge: ...)

Various things (in the wrong order, but anyway):

(1) server_version() now takes an argument that causes it to return
    structured information about the server build and the various
    options that have been compiled in.

(2) .protect_<property>=1 now prevents non-wizard *WRITES*
    the way it should have in the first place.  
    And, also, it actually *works* now (Jay had it disabled by default
    because it used to be horribly slow.  No longer; see next item.)

(3) The caching regime for server options, wherein you have to call 
    load_server_options() in order for server option changes to 
    actually take effect, has been extended beyond the
    .protect_<builtin_function> options, both to include all of the
    .protect_<property> options *and* also the

(4) New $server_options:

      max_string_concat (integer)
      max_list_concat   (integer)
      max_concat_catchable (flag)

In more detail...

server_version() takes an argument.

server_version(1) returns the entire structure of what's available,
and likewise for any other non-string argument.

A string argument retrieves a particular group (of settings) or
an individual parameter.  

Various possibilities:

    server_version() 
    server_version("string")
      -> original version string

    server_version("major")
    server_version("minor")
    server_version("release")
    server_version("ext")
      ->  components thereof

    server_version("features")
      -> {} [eventually] list of "waif","xml",etc...
         i.e., once those other branches incorporate this code

    server_version("options")
      ->  settings of various #defines from options.h

    server_version("make")
      -> variables on the make command line

    server_version("source")
      -> source control information

You can delve inside these to retrieve particular values, e.g., 

    server_version("options/DEFAULT_FG_TICKS") => 30000
    server_version("source/vcs") => "git"

Note that for options, what you're seeing is the compiled-in value, which may have nothing to with the actual parameter in effect if
something from $server_options is overriding it.

If you ask for something that's not there, E_INVARG will be raised.

The exact structure returned by server_version(1) is not yet specified -- that it's a list of pairs with the first item of each being a string is unlikely to change, but that's as much of a promise as I want to make at this point.  The question of which groups are available and/or contain anything useful will likewise depend on variations in the server build.

As for max_{string|list}_concat, the short story here (and what basically started this whole thing a couple weeks ago) is I officially got tired of various well-known, blow-up-the-MOO, memory-allocation-death one-liners being available.  The new options limit the ultimate sizes of lists and strings you can build; if you go over then we jump straight to out-of-seconds-buhbye with somewhat less bit-churning than before.  

If you set max_concat_catchable to something true, the out-of-seconds abort is replaced by a pleasant E_QUOTA error that you can actually catch.  This is perhaps more in keeping with the spirit of the language, however I've since found this option rather less useful than one might think, seeing as once values get above a certain size, you're usually mostly dancing with out-of-seconds death no matter what you do.  This bit may get taken out in a future release unless somebody actually finds it useful.

Note that there remain LOTS of ways to eat up memory that these options won't block.  Someone explicitly determined to crash the MOO will almost certainly be able to find a way around the new limits.  The point of this particular exercise is more to catch the one-liners that a newbie might be tempted to type by "accident" (presumably thinking, "No, that would be really stupid if *that* could crash the MOO; I wonder how they handle it...").  We will of course continue to appreciate your not trying to crash the MOO.

I just recently used the web to download a new extracted JHM core from here.
Great work whoever was involved!
I would like to suggest that the page include information about how
to download a copy of a server that works with it.
currently (Jan 2008), if you don't know the right command invocation, you get
an error message from sourceforge of:
browsing to CVS at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3692
something to the effect that "lambdamoo" was not a valid CVS repository.
I used the commands below to retrieve the code, even in the midst of this error.
watercore]$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@lambdamoo.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lambdamoo login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@lambdamoo.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/lambdamoo

.. that's it ...
I then just did a $ configure ; make
and it worked fine.
I am evaluating to see if this copy of the server includes the waif stuff.
I am suspicious that it won't.
It would be nice if someone would update the website to include this information for the next person trying to do this.

Subject:  Questions about newly extracted JHCore

As I mentioned earlier on *core, I have used the automagic core extractor
from here, and am now looking at the core that is extracted.
one of the first things I did was to eval ;players()
which gave me a list of objects.  I expected that the list returned
would all be corified players, such as $core_wizard or $housekeeper .
to my surprise, there are three objects i.e.:  #176 (J. Text)
 #181 (topic-owner), and  #185 (Quota) which are not corified.
Thinking they might be properties on $local, I checked there as well
but they aren't.  Knowing that using raw object numbers is bad-JUJU, 
I am wondering how these objects are used, and why they weren't deemed
worth of being corified with $names ...

Subject:  Could we include Ways Feature (#211) in the core extraction?

I am testing the newly extracted JHCore, and note that Ways Feature (#211) 
is not exported. We do export some features, so I assume that new core
has adequate support for this feature. While it is true that some cores
may have the need/desire to have a less VR way of listing the exits from
a room, it is common enough that a MOO will need this. The feature already
has its verbs owned by unknown hacker (#35), so it probably won't require
a major change to make it exportable.

PS: where is the step-by-step explaining what you have to do to make
something exportable from the core extraction code system?

Some of the objects that are in the core are referenced indirectly, like $topic.owner.  The old lambdacore scheme of taking all $foo is not used to make jhcore.  There's a seed list and each of those objects has a :nominate_for_core which returns other objects it needs (like its parents) and that's repeated to create the full set.

BTW $player:nominate_for_core includes @$player.features (the default features) so that's where the core features come from.  To be in the core you just have to be nominated.  You *can* have an :init_for_core or extend :nominate_for_core.  There's a parallel system for modules but only Ken understands modules.

Subject:  elaborate please...

I seem to understand 158 on *core to mean that if I have on my player
 a verb named "nominate for core" that I can nominate objects for inclusion
in cores that I extract.  So if I wanted to include the @ways feature
in a core that I extract, I would just have to have a verb that
returned that object number on my player object.
How do I keep the cores I want to extract from including all the objects
that someone else wants to have in their extracted core, but which I
don't want ?

Should it do this?  How do we determine what objects should be available if so?

CVS HEAD in fact does not include waifs.  Nothing in JHCore itself requires waifs, although there might be some modules that do.

If you want waifs for your own code or for modules or other porting, they are available in a branch (WAIF) on the sourceforge CVS.

Robby also has a branch in a git repository which integrates waifs, xml parsing and partial unicode support.  There may still be some issues to iron out with the unicode support.  If you're interested in this, ask Robby about it.

The Little Point
A small jut of land sticks out into the sea here. The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  The Susan Variable is resting here.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is chilly.
A small motorboat with the words "Susan Variable" written across the bow next to a small painting of the state flag of Virginia.
