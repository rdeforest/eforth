Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Subject: Build on Zaurus PDA: ast.c Compile Error

Trying to build the server on my Linux-based Sharp Zaurus PDA, make aborts with the following messages:
---
bash-2.05$ make

/config.status

Strange because I can find no `1' in any relevant place in the source.

Any insights (other than 'Why the h*ll do you want a MOO on your PDA?') most welcome.

Additional details:

Platform: Sharp Zaurus SL-C860 (Japan domestic version)
OS: Linux kernel 2.4.18-rmk7-pxa3-embedix
gcc version: 2.95.1
Lambda server: 1.8.1
Unpacked in directory I have rwx permission for.
configure runs normally.
options.h set for NS_BSD/NP_TCP.

Almost certailny your compiler is running out of RAM.  Either add more swap or build on a real machine iwth a cross-compiler (I strongly recommend the latter).

You really think a memory shortage is triggering the parse error? Other packages that have run out of memory during build have died with a nice 'out of memory on device' message.

Maybe your compiler is doing the moral equivalent of "#define arm 1" - this would explain the complaint about "1" in line 340, which is "Cond_Arm *arm, *next_arm;".  Try changing "arm" to something like "this_arm" in ast.c, decompile.c, and parser.y.

Looking forward to messages like *** Server shutdown by wizard (#2): system has been up for more than 4 hours, need to change battery ***

That seems to be exactly what was going on. Not strange since the Zaurus uses an ARM architecture CPU. Replacing 'arm' with 'my_arm' took me through a good part of the build. Now to figure out an error from bison...
