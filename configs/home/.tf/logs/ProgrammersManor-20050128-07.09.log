The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.

Sorry I haven't been around lately, but I've been really busy taking care of one of my dogs, who is very sick.  She has been afflicted with Blastomycosis, and I am currently treating her with Sporanox (@ $66 per week) and trying to pull her through this.  If you want to know more about the disease, use google, and type in Blastomycosis in dogs.  People do get it too, however, it's not a contagious disease.  I'll pop in when I can to say hi.  Take care!

Marcy giggles
Marcy says, "that's Minty"
You say, "Oh heh"
Marcy says, "and her dog has her ups and downs"
You say, "I saw the M and stopped reading the word"
Marcy laughs.
That is not a valid command.
Marcy says, "are you Crag?"
You say, "The M and the y for that matter"
You say, "yes"
Marcy says, "aha"
Marcy says, "thought so :)  Never knew your real name"
You say, "Crag, el Crago, Robert..."
You say, "Robert Andrew de Forest, at your service."
Robert bows.
Marcy curtseys.
He looks craggy...
He is awake and looks alert.

 the friendly stuff                      
You sit on the large maroon couch.
Marcy sits on the large maroon couch beside you.
You say, "So welcome to the MOO!"
Marcy says, "thanks!"
You say, "We're going to be restoring the old database this weekend, I think"
Marcy says, "Minty brought me here yesterday"
You say, "So you'll probably have to create yourself again when we do"
Marcy says, "yay!"
Marcy says, "okay"
You say, "Unless you were in that db already"
You say, "Were you around when we had lots of rooms here?"
You say, "The Manor theme"
Marcy says, "I think I was, yes"
You say, "OH ok, then you won't have to create yourself then"
You say, "heh"
Marcy says, "not sure though, it was a long time ago, so we'll see"
You say, "It has been a long time"
Marcy says, "nod"
You say, "I can't believe how fast last year went"
Marcy [to you]: busy guy eh?
You say, "kinda"
You say, "Mostly it's just that work drains my life force"
Marcy says, "awww"
You say, "In the 13 years I've been in the work force, this job is the only one that felt like "work""
Marcy says, "you work at Disney I think?"
You say, "But I have a lead on a new job which will be much more fulfilling"
You say, "yeah"
You say, "Still"
You say, "I've been working at Disney almost three years"
Marcy says, "oh, good luck on getting the new job"
You say, "Ironically, this is my least satisfying job, but also the one I've held the longest."
Marcy says, "funny how that works"
You say, "Maybe it's some kind of self-punishment thing I'm doing to myself."
Marcy giggles.
You say, "I think it's been months since I talked to you.  Anything new going on?"
You say, "Adventures?  Surprises?  Gossip?"
Marcy says, "Not really, pretty tired of sjr and it's bull"
Marcy says, "one adventure, Minty came to visit me last summer!"
Marcy says, "yay!"
You say, "YAY!"
You say, "I want to visit"
Marcy giggles.
You say, "I'm so tired of Seattle"
You say, "I get pissed off whenever I stop to look around me."
Marcy says, "awww, well come visit then"
You say, "I will!"
Marcy says, "yay!"
You say, "Where are you again? :)"
Marcy laughs.
Marcy says, "Canada"
You say, "Sounds great!"
Marcy says, "it is"
You say, "I can even fake the national anthem already"
You say, "Oh Canada, our home and native land..."
Marcy laughs.
You say, "Glorious and freeeee..."
Marcy applauds!
Robert mumbles something, "..command"
Marcy giggles.
You say, "WIth *mumble*hood and *mumble* hood..."
You say, "dum dum,... dumm dum.. dum dum..."
Marcy [to you]: lol
You say, "hmmm hmm, hmm hmm, hmmm hmmm, hmm hmm"
You say, "We stand on guard for thee!"
Marcy says, "woohoo! perfect!"
Robert laughs
You say, "My dad used to be in Kiwanis"
Marcy says, "cool!  "
You say, "I went with him a few times, and they sang both the US and CA anthems"
Marcy nods.
Marcy says, "I have to run for a few, but I'll be baaaack :)"
You say, "ok"
Robert grins.
Marcy hugs, thanks for the welcome
