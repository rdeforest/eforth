stormagnet has reconnected.
stormagnet says, "I GOT MY ADD CODE"
Crag grins.
Crag hrms
Crag says, "I'm having net conjestion, you doing any thing?"
Crag puts "Quality Of Service Network Conjestion Management" on his todo list
Crag says, "I CC'd you on my reply to my dad because I think my email is so incredibly interesting."
Crag says, "Mmm, Laws posted cat genetics news in Science> :)"
stormagnet says, "Wheee!"
stormagnet says, "I wasn't doing anything- on the network, anyway"
stormagnet says, "I was reading a printout for my next class."
Crag says, "Meh, must have been a spam flood or something"
stormagnet says, "Which reminds me- I need to set up a coLinux samba partition for sharing data between in and win"
stormagnet says, "That sounds a likely scenario"
stormagnet says, "There are some compsci students at a table one away from me"
stormagnet says, "I overheard them admiring my tablet"
stormagnet says, "Then mocking it when it made a windows sound"
stormagnet says, "Little do they know that this tablet is 1337er than all of them put together >:}"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "not like they'd know if you were just playing windows sounds in Linux anyway"
Crag says, "punks"
stormagnet . o O ( That windows beep? was my colinux terminal throwing a message. BITCHES. )
Crag says, "You should wear my Penguin Computing t-shirts if you don't have a personal or class dress code to live up to :)"
Crag says, "You want to setup samba right now?  I can lead you through it"
Crag says, "Actually, it's dead simple"
stormagnet says, "They can't see my screen, so they couldn't know how tricked out I have this thing >:}"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Naturally it starts with apt-get install samba"
Crag says, "Then all you have to do is edit /etc/samba/smb.conf"
Crag says, "And change..."
stormagnet nods
Crag checks his own config to jostle his memory
Crag says, "You might want to just read through the config"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "btw"
Crag says, "It's not too long and has a lot of comments"
Crag says, "And the stuff that doesn't make sense you can ignore"
stormagnet says, "Is there a way I could configu8re my gnome desktop geometry to match my starnet settings?"
Crag says, "Gnome should pull all its geometry info from X, which IS starnet"
Crag says, "So whatever is happening is a surprise to me :)"
Crag says, "Er, in other words, I don't know :)"
Crag says, "I wonder if there's a part of me that's threatened by how readily and frequently you ask me questions that I don't even know where to start looking to answer."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I DO know that there's a part of me that's aroused by your hard questions."
Crag grinsl
stormagnet says, "Well, that's why I *ask*"
Crag laughs
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet ... loses? (or WINS?)
stormagnet says, "How do I find out what to set that to?"
Crag says, "The answer is: yes."
Crag heh
Crag says, "WINS is stupid, you can ignore it"
Crag says, "WINS is 'WIndows Name Services'"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But the default mechanism uses NetBIOS broadcast, a technology from the mid-80s that works fine"
stormagnet says, "Some dumbass ns serving?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Pretty much"
stormagnet says, "Right thenm"
stormagnet says, "THEN"
stormagnet typos for Great Justice
Crag says, "WINS is a huge improvement over NetBIOS for large networks, but is terrible compared to DNS"
Crag typos too
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "OH WOW"
Crag says, "I just found out something cool"
Crag says, "NetBIOS name resolution works for Putty too"
Crag says, "So you can use 'colinux' as the hostname in PuTTY"
stormagnet says, "RAD!"
Crag says, "No need to export IP info via samba"
Crag says, "And that means you can use it with PSCP too"
Crag says, "Which is the PuTTy scp program"
stormagnet says, "And then I don't have to worry so much about my terminal paste buffer"
Crag says, "Totally"
stormagnet says, "And my inability to share it with win"
Crag says, "Yup"
stormagnet says, "SWEET"
Crag says, "Ok, checking samba config..."
stormagnet says, "So, DNS proxy = yes?"
Crag says, "Not sure, jussec"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "Waitaminnit"
Crag says, "Oh, you can leave DNS proxy off"
stormagnet says, "Okay :)"
Crag says, "I think the default config is all you need"
Crag says, "It will export your home dir by default"
Crag says, "So you can go to \\colinux\stormagnet and see your home dir"
Crag says, "With no special config or anything"
Crag says, "Damn, Debian sure does rock sometimes"
stormagnet says, ""
stormagnet says, "I forget"
stormagnet says, "Do I need to ifdown before pump?"
stormagnet's net is not working in colinux...
Crag says, "I don't think so, but I couldn't say definitively"
stormagnet ... forgot
Crag says, "Also, it occurs to me that you won't have to restart any of your services when you change IPs because they will listen on all interfaces and IPs by default"
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "Ummm"
stormagnet says, "Doing sudo pump from a terminal in colinux has it wigging out"
Crag says, "Wigging out?"
stormagnet says, "Maybe I just need to allocate more RAM, or something"
Crag says, "'free' will tell you your RAM situtionat"
Crag says, "situation even"
stormagnet says, "Freeze- no windows/icons - but I'm in single window mode..."
Crag says, "This is with the colinux-terminal-fltk?"
stormagnet will try puttying in :)
stormagnet says, "No, in desktop"
Crag says, "..."
Crag says, "X?"
stormagnet <- GUI addict
Crag says, "X will disconnect"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Because of the network topology change"
stormagnet says, "That would explain my problem, yes"
Crag says, "You will have to re-connect, and your old session will either be still around and unresumable or have died."
Crag says, "You can restart GDM via console or putty if you need to slap X with the cluestick"
stormagnet says, "free does seem to indicate a need for more RAM, though"
stormagnet is down to 16k
Crag says, "One or both of us should convert these conversations to online notes and lessons some day."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "18K ?!"
Crag says, "Er 16 even"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "ahehehehehjehehehehe"
Crag says, "Can you paste it at me?"
stormagnet says, "remember, we didn't allocate much, and gnome is turning into a bloaty little bitch"
stormagnet says, "waitaminnit"
Crag says, "I allocated 192M"
stormagnet says, "maybe meg"
Crag says, "I think you've probably got 16 or 160M"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Not 160m, that's for sure"
Crag says, "You also have a further 192M of swap"
Crag says, "So I'll be REALLY surprised if memory pressure is a real problem."
stormagnet should have puttyd, can't paste from fltk
Crag says, "Doh"
Crag says, "You can still putty in and etc"
Crag says, "or whatever"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Here's what my free looks like:"
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]

Done @pasting.
stormagnet needs to wrap up and head to class soon, though, be warned
stormagnet says, "Free Mem: 16424"
Crag says, "That's 64M allocated with some coLinux overhead, 59M used, ~2M free, no swapping"
stormagnet says, "So, more than your top line, so not bad"
Crag says, "Yeah, don't worry about it"
stormagnet stops teh freakage
Crag says, "You're probably using a lot of buffers and cache"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Worry when your Swap used gets above 96M"
Crag says, "Which would happen quickly if you ran firefox... aheh"
Crag kicks the mozilla developers in the 'near miss'
stormagnet says, "huh"
stormagnet says, "no gdm"
Crag says, "No /etc/init.d/gdm?"
stormagnet says, ":restarts x-win, gets the same"
stormagnet says, "gah"
Crag makes confused dog faces
Crag cocks his head
stormagnet says, "My colinux is back to the gnomeless mode"
Crag says, "Gnomeless mode..."
Crag says, "no login banner?"
Crag says, "Or"
Crag says, "OH"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "no xdm"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "or gdm, or whatevs"
stormagnet says, "trying to putty in to colinux just timed out"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "did I inadvertantly kill my colinux service"
Crag says, "You have no net"
Crag says, "Check your fltk console"
Crag says, "Try /etc/init.d/network restart"
Crag says, "You'll probably want to make an alias for that in your .bashrc"
Crag says, "Something like"
stormagnet says, "attached, monitor0"
Crag | alias bouncenet='sudo /etc/init.d/network restart'
Crag says, "It'd be nice if there were a way to poke your colinux without touching the console..."
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet says, "command not found..."
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "try networking instead of network"
Crag says, "I always forget which one is the new one"
Crag says, "Mostly because to me it's just /etc/init.d/net<tab>"
stormagnet says, "that done the trick"
stormagnet says, "woops, alarm went off"
Crag says, "time to go?"
stormagnet says, "time to haul ass"
stormagnet nods
Crag nods solemnly
Crag says, "I'll be around"
stormagnet says, "I may be back :)"
stormagnet says, "I am, in fact, back"
stormagnet says, "And somehow, once again, I managed to pick a crooked desk >_<"
Crag says, "doh"
stormagnet says, "I hate hate HATE these tiny lecture hall desks"
stormagnet says, "I've seen AIRPLANE TRAYS that are bigger"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "And at least THOSE are centered"
stormagnet says, "I swear, these desks are going to screw my back up worse than the backpack"
stormagnet says, "I am even beginning to suspect that they are DELIBERATELY crooked, in order to sort of tilt towards the student"
stormagnet says, "For (supposedly) a more comforting writing angle"
stormagnet says, "But laptops sit crooked, and books and beverages slide off them"
stormagnet says, "Maybe I just have a knack for picking the worst ones"
Crag says, "That would figure"
Crag says, "It goes along with your bug-finding thing"
stormagnet says, "I think I found an adjustable knob"
stormagnet says, "Hang on"
Crag hangs on for his life
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Nope"
stormagnet says, "Or if it is adjustable, it needs a special tool"
stormagnet is mightily tempted to bring a toolbox in her bag >:}
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
stormagnet says, "guewst lecturer just scared the shit out of me"
Crag says, "I have a special tool"
Crag says, "I don't know if it works on desks"
stormagnet says, "For a minute I thought I'd gone to the wrong cl;ass again"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "May I refer you to our student code of conduct, sir?!"
stormagnet says, "that's harrassment!!"
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "Only if it's in your pants"
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "Today's film is one I saw in TechCogEd"
stormagnet says, "sweet"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "that certainly facilitates chatting in class :)"
Crag says, "sweeeeet"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'm not feeling at all productive"
stormagnet says, "oh good"
stormagnet says, "I can facilitate that, too"
stormagnet ,-m enabler
Crag says, "I feel pretty good about making use of part of my vacation"
Crag says, "But I feel bad about not actually taking time off"
stormagnet . o O ( FUCKING TYPOS )
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet is still getting used to this keyboard
Crag says, "Fucking typos?  Are those what gets typed when people have sex on a keyboard?"
Crag says, "I don't think I could get used to sex on a keyboard"
stormagnet blinks!!
Crag giggles.
stormagnet says, "you're certainly riled up today, or something :)"
Crag says, "Yes, or something"
Crag says, "I went to sleep and woke up fantasizing about you bringing classmates home"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "I'll take the camera to practice, shall I?"
Crag ...
stormagnet says, "Oh, this is reminding me"
Crag says, "yes, please."
stormagnet says, "I should grab some Chomsky for supplemental readings"
stormagnet says, "So far I've only really read excerpts"
Crag says, "How did you get from me being riled up to Chomsky?"
Crag says, "Wikipedia has a huge page on Chomsky, but the way"
stormagnet says, "film"
stormagnet says, "w00t"
Crag says, "In case you're looking for links"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "The Chomsky page is relatively high-profile because of his politics"
Crag says, "People who think Wikipedia should be an idealogical battleground pick pages like his as fronts."
stormagnet says, "we read excerpts from Chomsky in TechCog, and I've been beaten over the head with his political writings "
stormagnet says, "But I haven't read any cover-to-cover"
Crag says, "Me either"
Crag says, "Would be good for my Aquarius book phase"
stormagnet says, "mmm"
stormagnet says, "now they're showing the molecule models as an analogy for words"
stormagnet says, "now I want to play with wordnet sokme more"
stormagnet says, "some"
stormagnet says, "auigh"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Another good megatokyo today"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIAN*ISTS*, DAMMIT"
stormagnet says, "It adds a letter!!"
Crag . o O ( or it gets the hose.  again. )
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "HAW- they're on about NLP, now"
Crag snorts.
stormagnet says, "I'm really impressed with how far it's come since the last time I played with it"
Crag says, "I love how acedemia is both ahead and behind the times no matter where one looks"
stormagnet says, "More so since this film was made"
stormagnet says, "It's 70-tastic"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "Figures"
Crag says, "I'm using the 'personal' category in the todo list to identify items which correspond to habits I'm trying to develop"
stormagnet says, "awesome!"
stormagnet says, "that's a good use for it"
stormagnet says, "HAW"
stormagnet says, "cute bossy little kids!!"
Crag says, "GTD doesn't address this kind of item"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I love it when 3 year olds use the lecture voice"
stormagnet says, "cracks me right up"
stormagnet says, "serves people right for patronizing them with that tone in the first place, to hear it back >:}"
stormagnet says, "geore carlin, yo"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "I think that's him in this, or his double"
stormagnet says, "imdb, save me!"
Crag says, "George Carlin has a lot of interesting things to say about english and languages in general"
Crag says, "Not just about profanity either"
Crag says, "Could be meat, could be cake.  It's MeatCake!"
stormagnet says, "Wow, even imdb failed"
stormagnet says, "nice and obscure"
Crag says, "It probably is him"
Crag says, "Er, is he"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "him"
Crag says, "Oh right, him is indirect, he is direct"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "english is hard :)"
Crag says, "He gave the ball to him.  The person who received the ball was he."
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "Man, I can't find anything"
stormagnet gives up
stormagnet says, "I'll just have to go crazy"
stormagnet says, "He IS doing a kind of humor- coming up with "this sentance has never been spoken before""
stormagnet says, "Like "Throw that anchor over here, I've got room for two or three more in my pocket.""
Crag says, "Yeah, that's definitely George Carlin"
Crag says, "He does lots of word games in his act"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I think that Brain Droppings book also mentioned this film"
Crag says, "Sharp responded to me yesterday, but TMDA had the message queued 'cause I forgot to add them to my whitelist"
Crag says, "Probably"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "The support guy gave me a number to call, which I will do... later."
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "Oi"
stormagnet says, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
Crag says, "That was a Chomsky construction, wasn't it?"
stormagnet says, "I don't know about colorless green, but I think ideas sleeping furiously is plenty parsable "
stormagnet says, "*I* sure sleep furiously :)"
Crag says, "English is very flexible that way"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Applying things to each other which normally aren't does generate new meanings."
stormagnet says, "it's actually a point about all languages"
Crag says, "Which is how buzzwords are generated"
stormagnet says, "that you can say something syntactically correct, but semantically wrong"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to sleep with a vengeance tonight"
stormagnet says, "aw, they're talking about 'intelligent machines' and 'machine language'"
Crag groans
stormagnet says, "70's techy starry eyes"
stormagnet says, "DUDE"
stormagnet says, "I am so SICK of people talking about 'machine language' as a language"
stormagnet says, "Just because it's a convenient naming convention doesn't mean it's an actual language"
Crag says, "It's a protocol"
stormagnet says, "when we can have a programming language that functions as a true language, then we'll have true AI"
stormagnet says, "That's my theory"
stormagnet says, "of course, that ties into my central obsession :)"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "Larry Wall is heading there :)"
Crag says, "That's true"
stormagnet says, "That's why the type strictist hate him so :)"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "the more coherant nonsense, the better the capability for abstraction, or sokmething"
Crag says, "I think we need a lot more layers"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Hmmm"
stormagnet says, "I think I need to learn walpiri"
stormagnet says, "aborigine language"
stormagnet says, "sounds awesome"
stormagnet says, "has no subject/verb/object order at ALL"
stormagnet says, "works by suffix conjugation, like latin"
stormagnet should learn latin, too, for that matter
stormagnet says, "There's a girl in this class who's taking latin and arabic"
stormagnet says, "A divide-and-conquer-the-world strategy of language learning, or something :)"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I want to take latin"
Crag says, "I did a semester when I was homeschooling"
stormagnet says, "yeah, that is TOTALLY carlin"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "whoops, class is over"
Crag says, "bye"
stormagnet says, "they couldn't fot the whole film in"
stormagnet says, "fit, dammit"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "grr"
stormagnet says, "I'll be back"
Crag nods
stormagnet says, "I have another class in this same building in an hour, so I'm just going to chill out out here on the bench :)"
stormagnet says, "GOD, I'm a digging this campus wide wireless"
stormagnet says, "this tablet is just the best thing EVAH"
stormagnet says, "I'm really glad I didn't wait until february to buy it"
stormagnet says, "I'm totally scanning as much of my textbooks as I can this weekend"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'm trying to clean up the computer room some more"
stormagnet says, "awewsome"
stormagnet says, "I'll just finish that thing I was reading earlier"
stormagnet says, "Man"
Crag says, "I'm waiting 'till you're done with navi before I tackle the server/network infrastructure situation"
stormagnet says, "Professorsw who assign their own books are such cheaters"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "hopefully, I'll finish transferring everything this weekendd"
stormagnet says, "I've still got a good 75 gig one maneki"
Crag says, "You can stay home while I'm at practice since we're putting off the ring purchases"
stormagnet says, "so I really just need to burn off my anime ^_^;;"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and transfer as many of my mp3s as possible"
Crag says, "You'll be bottlenecked by the speed of your burner"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Your tablet will be plenty fast to keep the burner's buffer full while doing lots of other stuff"
Crag says, "I expect"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "what's navi's ip right now, anyway?"
Crag says, "You won't be able to reach it from there"
Crag says, "it's behind double firewalls"
stormagnet says, "not even from wrack?"
stormagnet says, "damn"
Crag says, "Not even from wrack"
stormagnet says, "wow, dude"
Crag says, "Wrack is on the 10 network but not the 192.168.1"
stormagnet says, "okay"
Crag says, "it's non-trivial to fix, too"
Crag says, "sorry"
stormagnet says, "I was just going to check how much I have left to move, anyway"
stormagnet says, "it was a trivial interest"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "so, I guess I'll let you get back to cleaning"
stormagnet says, "I'll finifsh worrying about my colinux net and samba later :)"OWIE"
stormagnet says, "AUITGH"
Crag ?
stormagnet should note that, in the future, it would be wise NOT to sit directly beneath the bell in the hallway
Crag says, "ah"
Crag says, "Your samba should be working"
stormagnet says, "I didn't set up a partition or anything, though"
Crag says, "It will share your home by default"
stormagnet says, "ah!"
stormagnet says, "okay"
Crag says, "start->run->\\colinux\stormagnet"
Crag says, "Ohwait"
Crag says, "username and password"
Crag says, "In colinux you need to do an smbpasswd -a stormagnet"
Crag says, "And then give it a password"
Crag says, "I think"
stormagnet says, ""okay"
Crag says, "Or just try your regular colinux password first, maybe it will work :)"
stormagnet says, "sweet"
stormagnet says, "It's working!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "thank you :)"
Crag says, "welcome!"
stormagnet says, "Now I can use staroffice for all my docs (i hope)"
stormagnet says, "erm, whoops"
stormagnet says, "I think I need to tweak my home directory permissions, or something, first"
Crag says, "You might want to share maneki's c:\documents and settings\stormagnet or something then"
Crag says, "So you can get to it from X"
Crag says, "To avoid having to move files back and forth"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "how do I do that?"
Crag says, "browse to c:\documents and settings, right click stormagnet, then... properties I think?  Then sharing?"
Crag says, "or something"
Crag says, "You might have to turn on file sharing in your network settings too"
Crag says, "I don't remember"
Crag says, "And you might want to wait until we do some security analysis :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I can't copy files from win to colinux"
stormagnet says, "that's what's confusing me"
Crag says, "Is your home read-only?"
Crag says, "It might be the default"
stormagnet says, "I just changed that"
Crag says, "/etc/init.d/samba restart"
stormagnet says, "do I need "
stormagnet loses
Crag heh
Crag says, "You might also need to indicate that the [homes] section is not a guest-access share"
Crag says, "That it should use the local user's perms instead of 'nobody'"
Crag says, "I don't know off the top of my head how to do that. :)"
stormagnet says, "nope"
stormagnet says, "still no love, even after a restart on both ends"
Crag says, "k, lemme check a manual"
Crag says, "I think you need to explicitly add 'read only = no' to the [homes] section if you haven't already"
Crag still reading
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I don't know what the difference between read only = no and writeable = yes is"
Crag says, "But both seem like a good idea :)"
Crag . o O ( why do they have two ways of saying the same thing? )
Crag says, "ok, read only is an inverted synonym for writeable"
Crag says, "They really are the same thing"
Crag says, "So either one by itself is sufficent"
Crag says, "So now I will look for other explinations"
Crag says, "Ok, I got it to work on my laptop"
Crag says, "The only problem I had was making sure I was logged in as 'robert' while accessing the robert directory"
Crag says, "So I'll just wait to hear more from you before digging any further"
stormagnet says, "Okay, I was going over my student accounts"
Crag says, "I got the filing cabinet all the way inside the closet, and I can access all the files that are in it still"
stormagnet says, "(Since I just registered for Japanese 212, yet more tuition charges posted, and I was reading the student insurance plan documentation to decide if I wanted to cancel it and get the money back- which I think I do, since I no longer have cause to belief that I'm about to be diagnosed with something that would qualify as a scary 'pre-existing' condition, and this plan is otherwise pretty crappy.)"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "The cabinet will be easier to use once wrack and bouncer are out of the closet, but even now it's good enough"
Crag says, "I think I better see if I can clean the gutters right now while it's not actively raining."
Crag sighs with dread
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "i'm setting up a reminder for myself to do this in the spring and fall from now on"
stormagnet says, "I'm cancelling the student health insurance- I'd have to have something really hideous to justify what they're charging for it when I already have your insurance :)"
Crag says, "Okee dokee"
Crag says, "You got packages from Toshiba and 'Alloy'?"
Crag says, "Alloy package is big and light, I'm guessing more clothes?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "And furry boots!"
Crag heh
Crag says, "yay"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "Hrm, all three weather sites say it's raining right now"
Crag says, "I wonder if I should even bother"
Crag says, "I'll probably just get up there and then start to feel the first sprinkle"
Crag says, "And we need a new ladder"
Crag says, "nevermind, I've talked myself out of it"
stormagnet says, "the toshiba will be the car chqarger"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "we can play with that stuff tonight or tomorrow or something"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I have myself down for getting to sleep by 9pm tonight"
Crag says, "Somehow that doesn't seem realistic"
Crag drums his fingers.
Crag drum, drum.
Crag casts about looking for something... common sense of some sort, perhaps.
Crag drum, drum.
Crag says, "I should do the acidic adderall dump as soon as we get home"
Crag says, "Maybe that will help"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "OOPS"
stormagnet says, "My next class, while normally in this building, is actually in Mary Gates Hall on fridays, not The Ugly Fucker"
stormagnet says, "I need to head over there now"
Crag says, "aheh"

Crag says, "See ya! :)"
stormagnet will get the hang of this... eventually.

Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "some kind of eastern european"
Crag says, "Which class is this now?"
stormagnet says, "film"
Crag says, "Ahh, I should have guessed"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "So..."
Crag says, "There's two teachers AND a TA with a thick eastern european accent?"
Crag says, "..."
Crag says, "Did you sign us up for a reality TV show? :)"
Crag says, "'cause it wasn't me"
stormagnet says, ""Actually, that describes most of ::::::wow"
stormagnet says, "I'm all kind of hung"
stormagnet says, "No keyboard response, or anything"

stormagnet says, "DAMN"
stormagnet says, "That was... something"
Crag ..
stormagnet says, "I had to unplug and pull the battery"
Crag says, "Did you see what I typed after you emoted 'types into the void'?"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "That's... crazy"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Microsoft, you so crazy"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "The accent turns out to be Bulgarian"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "It is a pretty wild one"
Crag says, "Well here's what I tried to type at you:"
stormagnet says, "film comes out more like 'fume'"
Crag says, "Dunno if you'll see this, but I just posted the Space album for Barb to download.  If you find yourself in need of tunes, it's at"
Crag | http://defore.st/Space
stormagnet says, "Awesome :)"
stormagnet says, "I will copy that to maneki when I copy my mp3s"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "For as hard as it was to get a copy I don't feel bad pirating that one"
Crag says, "Same for the miss jane I haven't ripped yet"
Crag says, "I'm listening to snippets of the Space album for summarizing in my email to Barb"
Crag says, "So far there's only three songs I'd call "good""
stormagnet says, "Wow, she sounds like she's a bit bitter about some past instructor evals"
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "A disclaimer at the beginning of class like that can't be a good sign"
Crag says, "Eh?"
stormagnet says, "We're shuffling- I'll give you details later"
Crag says, "k"
stormagnet says, "yeah, I can see why she'd get lukewarm reviews"
stormagnet says, "this shuffle is going to take all period"
stormagnet says, "she's splitting us into groups of 3"
stormagnet says, "But assigned weirdly, rather than just counted off"
stormagnet says, "And she tried to partition the roomk in some weird, convoluted way that no one could understand even without the accent"
stormagnet says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "omfg, assigned seats"
stormagnet cracks up
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "oh my god, this is gettink kafkaesque"
Crag says, "What is she hoping to accomplish?"
Crag . o O ( people are funnier than anybody )
stormagnet says, "she can't remember names without a seating chart"
Crag says, "I guess that's OK, but couldn't she have just said 'Pick a seat now and don't move.'?"
stormagnet says, "sweet, I got assigned a seat in the middle back, right in front of the projector, with a power outlet and ethernet socket directly behind"
Crag says, "haw!"
stormagnet says, "and this class has table style desks in risers, instead of those horrible little tray desks"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeeeeet"
Crag says, "It's the continuing adventures of DUSOMETHINGOROTHER"
stormagnet says, "first paper is due friday the thirteenth"

stormagnet might just, at that, later
stormagnet says, "omfg"
stormagnet says, "our first paper is a response to ONE FRAME"
stormagnet says, "and we get to know which one it is IN ADVANCE"
stormagnet falls over
Crag snickers
Crag says, "After all you went through at Evergreen, I think you deserve to have a semester like this."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I mean with the sillyness and the bird course and all that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "There's only four good tracks on this Space album"
stormagnet says, "hopefully the TA won't have much to do with these group discussions, because there is a HUGE communication barrier"
Crag says, "But one of them is actually two songs with a large silent gap between them"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Too bad you're not studying Bulgarian, huh :)"
Crag says, "If you do download the album, you'll probably just want 1, 3, 5 and 14"
Crag says, "The rest are complete snooze fests."
stormagnet says, "she sounds kind of like fran drescher"
Crag says, "Wow"
Crag says, "That's... lending credance to my concerns about Reality TV :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I'm on The Truman Show!"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "That WOULD explain some of the strange stories in your life"
Crag says, "... and Billy"
Crag says, "Billy is an over-actor :)"
Crag says, "He's a drama-school drop-out and he knows someone on the production team"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "Naw"
Crag says, "Now I have to figure out if I know if this is a show or not."
stormagnet says, "I'm in one of those shoujo animes that just slides slowly into the truly surreal and fucked up"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "You don't LOOK drawn..."
Crag says, "maybe the squaresoft people were involved"
Crag says, "And Peter Jackson"
Crag says, "And the award for most CG-enriched romantic comedy goes to..."
Crag says, "Peter Jackson for 'Stormagnet: the maddening!'"
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "man, I don't even really need to read much of the textbook"
stormagnet says, "all I need so far is my usual film geekery"
stormagnet <- NERD
Crag grins.
Crag says, "You are such a nerd"
Crag says, "I have got to be the luckiest techies evar"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "A beautiful wife who wants to share girlfriends with me, wants to do technical projects with me, treats me like a king, teaches me whatever I want and nothing that I don't.  Loyal, adoring, patient, ambitous, and a HUGE NERD."
Crag says, "AND I get along with your family"
Crag says, "It's unreal"
Crag says, "And by get-along-with I mean that even though they kinda irritate me, they all treat me like I walk on water or something. :)"
Crag says, "AND you have an excellent sense of humor"
Crag says, "AND you have excellent social skills"
Crag says, "And great friends"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "A few :)"
Crag says, "AND!  And you get along with my friends and family and we've met new friends together who are great"
Crag says, "If this is a TV show about me, it's one of those wish-fulfillment stories"
Crag says, "Hey!"
Crag says, "We're going to be in the U District anyway"
Crag says, "Want to stop by Something Silver tonight?"
Crag says, "Since you like Lady Sovereign so much, you should probably check out Mia"
Crag says, "I'll see if I can get you a link"
Crag says, "Hrm."
Crag says, "I'll make note of them next time I hear them on KEXP"
Crag . o O [ you dub hub ]
stormagnet wakews
stormagnet wakes, even
stormagnet wonders if there's a roberty in the house
stormagnet has finished her lesson, and is now at the HUB, studying
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "I'm having a really hared time maintaining a connection to wrack"
stormagnet says, "I keep having to relogin on the horde, as well as restarting my putty sessions"

Crag says, "I forgot to take my meds thismorning"
Crag says, "i'm walking dead"
Crag says, "I had some McDonald's for breakfast, and I'm thinking about stopping at SubWay on my way to Antioch"
Crag says, "Or maybe just McDonald's which is closer anyway"
Crag says, "Jean's letting me leave a little early"
Crag says, "So I'm headed out now to get food and head over to Antioch.  I'll probably be picking you up in an hour or so."
Crag says, "Unless for some crazy reason this meeting runs long"
stormagnet says, "okay :)"

Crag rar
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet pwned that kanji test like the little bitch it was
stormagnet says, "Not only was it reading only, but we got the kanji in SENTANCES, and thus, could INFER through CONTEXT the meaning."
stormagnet says, "WAY easier than I'd been afraid of, and short, too."
stormagnet says, "If I can manage to keep this up, I might yet manage a 4.0, even with a 2/6 on last weeks vocabulary quiz"

Capsaicin, the compound in chili peppers that gives them their heat, may help protect against liver cancer, according to a recent study in which capsaicin helped kill cancerous liver cells. Use hot salsa made with chili peppers to flavor your favorite foods, such as omelets, mixed vegetable dishes, and burritos.

Crag wakes
Crag says, "nice"
Crag says, "I just had an astrology thought about you"
Crag says, "I was thinking about how on the one hand you bite off more than you can chew, but on the other you don't give yourself credit for your abilities in the areas you bite on."
Crag says, "And I think that may be tied to your Saturn in Libra"
Crag says, "Balance is your challenge"
Crag says, "I thought it was a contradiction, but now I see it differently"
Crag says, "With your sun, mercury and venus in libra, you already are about balance, and you think balanced and admire balance"
Crag says, "But Saturn goes against all that"
Crag says, "It's your devouryness"
Crag gets busy again
Crag gets unbusyish
Crag says, "I'm meeting Nicole after work at her apartment, and we'll probably talk for an hour or two.  Does that mesh well with your going home schedule?"
Crag [to stormagnet]: and following up on that Saturn thing, I feel compelled to mention again that I find you utterly fascinating.
stormagnet says, "Wow, this lecture is useless for anything other than the entertainment value of the prof's resemblance to Woody Allen"
stormagnet says, "Dude's trying to define a syllable and failing"
stormagnet says, "A syllable is a consanant-vowel pair... except where it's just a vowel. Or just a consanant."
stormagnet says, "Umm."
stormagnet says, "Dude didn't say the constant part, but I can think of several examples"
stormagnet says, "I defined it as the smallest pronouncable unit of a word."
stormagnet says, "I like mine better :P"
stormagnet reads scroll
stormagnet needs to set that scroll option thingy
stormagnet says, "Sooner or later, I'm sure I'll have a reason for showing up for this lecture, as opposed to just reading the book"
stormagnet says, "I'm sure we're just in the introductory phase, and thus slow"
stormagnet says, "But, DAMN"
stormagnet says, "As for meeting Nicole after work"
stormagnet says, "Are you still coming to the Winter Quarter Reception with me"
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet says, "5:30pm"
stormagnet says, "We are now perusing an exhaustive list of ways in which English spelling is BROKEN"
stormagnet says, "Every few minutes I come up from Junk and check what he's talking about and he's STILL ON THIS LIST"
stormagnet says, "Goddamn, dude, STILL"
stormagnet says, "ENGLISH CAME FROM GERMAN?!?"
stormagnet says, "I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL LATIN AND SHIT?!"
stormagnet considers posting in OBVIOUS>
stormagnet says, "JNow I want to watch My Fair Lady again"
stormagnet says, "Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?!"
stormagnet says, "OMFG, it's Stick Figure Death Theater on the overhead transparency!!"
stormagnet says, "I wish my cell camera worked, well, AT ALOL"
stormagnet says, "ALL"
stormagnet says, "This doodle is priceless"

stormagnet says, "HERE we go"
stormagnet says, "Nice physiology lesson"
stormagnet says, "I need my firefox back"
stormagnet says, "I needs me some adblock"
stormagnet says, "stupid javascript"
stormagnet says, "there was a flash ad that just started playing sound at me in THE MIDDLE OF CLASS"
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad they put a volume knob on the front of this thing"
stormagnet says, "wow, I'm not the only one laughing at this lecture"
Crag says, "I didn't have the Reception in my Zaurus"
stormagnet says, "S'all good"
stormagnet says, "I'ma go have lunch now- I'll be back in the MOO in about 10 minutes :)"
Crag says, "mm, lunch"
Crag says, "Imma heat up my curry as soon as Jean gets off the phone"
stormagnet says, "How do I turn that scrollback locking feature on, again?"
Crag says, "In tinyfugue?  /more on"
Crag says, "I think"
Crag says, "You can check out my .tfrc and .tf/ directory on wrack if you're looking for configuration ideas"
Crag says, "Most of the code in those was written in '96"
Crag says, "or earlier in some cases"
Crag says, "I love that it still works"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I should do that"
stormagnet says, "I need to copy over my .bashrc,. too"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "So, what about the Winter Reception?"
stormagnet says, "This reading for my film class is really good- you might like to read it, too"
stormagnet says, "It's on the history of samurai and bushido, and it's REALLY thorough"
stormagnet says, "(We're watching The Seven Samurai today)"
stormagnet . o O ( mmmmmmm.. kurosawa )
stormagnet says, "Speaking of which, it's time I headed over there now"
Crag says, "I'll give you a call after I get done with work"
Crag says, "Or a text message"
stormagnet says, "okay :)"
stormagnet says, "oog"
stormagnet says, "I'm a bit miggly this afternoon"
stormagnet says, "stomach miggly"
Crag says, "Big network disaster, much work miggly"
Crag says, "well, kinda big"
stormagnet says, " I wonder if I put something spoiled in my lunch?"
stormagnet says, "I"m feeling pretty sick"
stormagnet says, "I missed the scene I'm supposed to analyze because I was in the toilet, yjtowing up"
Crag says, "Oy"
Crag says, "I'm heading out, will be in the Udist in a bit.  I guess give me a call as soon as you're out or something"
Crag idles: Oy
[Idling at 4:21 P.M. on Mon, Jan 9: Oy]
Crag is back... and how.
Crag says, "Had great talk with Allison. :)"
Crag says, "Did good things for my mood, I think"
Crag says, "More network crap this morning"
stormagnet says, "God fucking damn it"
stormagnet says, "It has officially taken ONE WEEK EXACTLY for me to lose my student id"
stormagnet says, "Luckily, I reported it lost before anybody found it and went on a vending machine rampage >_<"
stormagnet headdesks, repeatedly
stormagnet says, "I was craving a vending machine cola so very badly, too"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "I left my lunch in the car by mistake"
stormagnet says, "NOES!"
Crag says, "Also, just heard from Something Silver.  They can't get titanium rings in half sizes."
Crag says, "So we should probably stop in again and see if the next whole size would ne OK"
Crag says, "would be OK"
stormagnet says, "dammit!"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to take a wild guess, and say titanium rings can't be stretched, either >_<"
Crag says, "Correct, they're milled"
Crag says, "We could stop by after I pick you up"
Crag says, "or whatever"
stormagnet says, "Sounds like a great plan"
stormagnet says, "Do you have any plans for next Wednesday night?"
stormagnet says, "I have to stay late to watch a film for Japanese Civ class, but we're invited to bring friends"
stormagnet says, "To make the idea of mandatory-class-outside-class-hours more palatable, I guess"
stormagnet says, "It's a movie about tea ceremony, set in Heian Japan"
stormagnet says, "At least, I think it's set in Heian- that's the period we're starting on right now, so it makes sense"
Crag says, "Tomorrow wednesday or next week?"
stormagnet says, "Next week"
Crag says, "I'm recording with Barb's tom that night"
stormagnet says, "Okay"
stormagnet says, "I guess I'll meet you after, then- the film is from 6-9"
Crag says, "But I could pick you up afterwards"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I can get to bed late on Wednesday, and we were already planning on recording from 6-9"
Crag says, "So that works out great"
stormagnet says, "In other news, getting my replacement ID was relatively painless"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "Excellent!"
stormagnet says, "They had the id on file, so they just printed out another"
stormagnet says, "Took all of maybe 5 minutes, most of which was standing in line"
stormagnet says, "There WAS a $10 charge, though, which makes me kick myself"
Crag says, "That's not bad"
stormagnet says, "No"
Crag says, "Is your old ID canceled too?"
stormagnet says, "The only reason I'm really kicking myself"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag says, "good"
stormagnet says, "Is because I'd been debating with myself as to whether or not I'd 'earned' the expense of a cola from the vending machine, rather than just filling up my water bottle or making tea."
stormagnet says, "I had finally argued that I *had*, by virtue of not getting vitamin water at the gym :P"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm trying not to let myself make a habit of buying food and beverage on campus, because of how easily the expense can rack up"
Crag says, "That's a familiar feeling"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I mean about thinking I'm good and then making another mistake of some sort"
Crag says, "In other news I almost mispelled 'network outage' as 'network outrage'"
stormagnet says, "Aw!"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "That was an awesome misspelling"
Crag says, "thank you"
Crag says, "Network outrage: taking down the man"
Crag says, "I told Jean about my typo"
Crag says, "And he said"
Crag says, "Yeah, that's appropriate"
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "That's awesome :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Alito's hearings are on CNN"
Crag says, "I don't think he's going to make it"
Crag says, "Based on the questions senators are posing, I think they've already made their minds up"
Crag says, "Bush crossed the line and stepped on their toes"
Crag says, "So they're not going to cut Alito any slack at all"
Crag says, "And he doesn't have that confident demeanor that Roberts has"
Crag says, "Alito is a big dork :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "And a walking sphincter"
stormagnet says, "Whoops"
stormagnet says, "Horse club is having a meeting tomorrow"
stormagnet only just got the email
stormagnet says, "Erm, tonight"
stormagnet says, "Not tomorrow"
stormagnet is all unstuck in time
Crag blinks
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "So I'll be meeting up with you after SgWD proactice then?"
Crag says, "What's the time frame of your meeting?"
stormagnet says, "6 is when it starts"
Crag says, "I better call you when I get out of practice then"
stormagnet says, "I don't think it will be a very LONG meeting, though"
Crag says, "Though"
Crag says, "We're not recording, so you could call if you want"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But it sounds like you'll be done first"
Crag says, "SO it probably makes the most sense for me to call you"
stormagnet says, "That would be better, given reception problems on campus"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "Well either way :)"
Crag says, "Where would you like to camp out?"
Crag says, "HUB?"
stormagnet says, "I'll call you, then maybe get an ewstimate of how much longer you'll be?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Is there some other way I could reach you while you're at the HUB?"
stormagnet says, "well, there's this..."
stormagnet says, "I can't wait for Animal Crossing to arrive"
stormagnet says, "Then we can use thqat to chat, too"
stormagnet says, "Could we maybe store at Scarecrow on the way home, and pick up a copy of Seven Samurai there?"
stormagnet says, "Then I wouldn't have to mess with the VCR"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Yeah, we can do that"
stormagnet says, "Yay!!"
Crag says, "So to contact you."
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I'm thinking I may break my 8pm rule in order to make up for Saturday"
Crag says, "So unless Barb gets tired or something I think we may run till 8:30 or 9"
Crag says, "Could you get one of the Horse Club buddies give you a ride to Dante's or something?"
Crag says, "Network Outrage continues apace"
Crag says, "All of this stuff since Sunday has been for one business unit"
Crag says, "The poor woman who is VP of that BU is stressing out"

Crag says, "I feel like I know how she feels because of how difficult last summer was for tech services"

stormagnet says, "I couldn't get a ride to Dante's, but the HUB is open until 11pm"
stormagnet says, "I'll check my voicemail frequently"
stormagnet says, "Man, we NEED the Criterion Kurosawa collection"
stormagnet says, "BADLY"
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet says, "Linguistic class is getting interesting"
stormagnet says, "We're learning the IPA, and articulatory phonetics (ie the mechanics of speech)"
stormagnet says, "I can now diagram the speech production mechanism from memory, because I am Bad Ass."
stormagnet says, "Including pharynx, larynx, and glottis"
Crag says, "Holy cow"
Crag says, "You'll have to show me some of that stuff later"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "citizens demand it"
stormagnet says, "I cannot, however, consistently remember how to spell "alveolar ridge""
stormagnet >_<
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "Japanese is a great language for studying linguistics"
stormagnet says, "Because its kana system is so perfectly phonetic"
stormagnet says, "Though it leaves out a lot of sounds"
Crag says, "Cool"
Crag says, "hee hee, Alito's not answering the questions"
stormagnet says, "I have noted that Japanese and Chinese are both extremely popular languages with linguists ^_^"
stormagnet says, "HAW"
Crag says, "One senator cut him off because he was just rambling"
stormagnet is SHOCKED
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "It's on mute with closed captioning, so I'm getting a warped perception"
Crag says, "But I feel confident that nobody I've seen interviewing him likes him"
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "No, you're bang on"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "I think that they take turns, yes? Dems and Republicans?"
stormagnet says, "It's supposed to be a bit like cross-examination"
stormagnet says, "I don't think even most Republicans like him *personally*, either- just ideologically"
stormagnet says, "Alito is not renowned for being likeable in person"
stormagnet says, "That said, I need to head over to class now"
stormagnet says, "be back soon, maybe"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet says, "Mifune is such a magnificent bastard"

stormagnet says, "there's an amazingly hot redhead in my japanese class quiz group"
stormagnet says, "who I spotted in my japanese history class earlier"
Crag . o O [ arr umm num ]
stormagnet says, "indeed"
stormagnet says, "I was thinking earlier that my history prof can't have studied Japanese- her pronunciation is just comic"
stormagnet says, "and she misses the kanji puns/layereed meanings in heian poetry"
stormagnet says, "like the classic example of a pine tree vs end vs to wait"
stormagnet says, "three different kanji, same pronunciation"
stormagnet says, "ergo, lots of pine trees in heian poetry"
Crag says, "heh"

Crag says, "Should we just shoot for Saturday?  I have band practice from 3-5"
Crag says, "Or should we schedule them for different days?"

stormagnet sighs
stormagnet should be studying, not screwing around with colinux
Crag grrrs at colinux and windows
Crag nods
stormagnet says, "I had been keeping my files in colinux and sharing them with windows, but I think I'ma have to do it the other way around"

stormagnet says, "I have console access back now"
Crag says, "I'd like to suggest, however, that you might want to review your committments and see if there's something that you want to backburner or drop"
stormagnet says, "yep, that fixed it"
Crag says, "Restarting the service reboots it"
Crag says, "So if that won't fix it, it's hosed. :)"
stormagnet says, "I should get myself some sort of shortcut for restarting it"
Crag says, "Make a list of stuff you want out of your tablet"

Crag says, "And that's part of how I'm able to speak up at all"

Crag [to Jacque]: thanks for the help, bro
Crag says, "Looking up 'broker' and following links reminded me of the time in high school when I was in the Academic Decathalon.  There was a sort of 'debate' component, except that there was no provision for an opposing point of view.  Someone (I think it was me) had the idea of pairing off the Decatholon participants from our school into alternate sides of variuos issues.  One of the other participants said she would take "money is the root of all evil" and I said I'd take the counter point.  I spent a day working on the points I would pursue, and then at the next meeting she said she wasn't interested in the subject anymore"
Crag says, "dammit."
Crag says, "it looks like 'broker' is probably the word I was looking for"
Crag says, "But I could have sworn there was an even more specific word for it"

Crag says, "heh, I'm sending Amazon a suggestion"
Crag says, "I'm going to paste it at you, cause I love sharing"
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
This is a somewhat silly suggestion, but I wish I could easily get a short link to products so I can write them down or paste them in forums which don't accept long URLs without mangling them.

My ideal maximum URL length is 70 charachters, including the http:// and hostname.  You could trim four charachters by removing the "www.", of course, but you'll probably need your own form of TinyURL service on your end to cram all that information into 70 chars.  "http://amazon.com/" is 18 chars, so I'm asking you to find a way to cram 99 chars (for the URL I'm currently looking at) into 62.  You might be able to trim that down further by reducing (in this case) "/gp/product/" down to "/g/p" or something.  I haven't done any analysis of your URLs, so I don't know if qid, sr, ref or any of the other variable-name looking stuff could be shortened.  The "Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work" would probably be to provide a "short link to this page" button somewhere, and then whenever someone clicks it, store the current page's URL in a table with an AUTO INCREMENT column to use as an ID, then append the id and hash to a tinyurl namespace (http://amazon.com/tu/id+hash/) handled by an app on your servers which checks the hash and either proxies or redirects to the referenced page.  The hash prevents people from snooping on what other people are using the tinyurl mechanism for.  Or, if you knew for certain that the hash would always be unique, you could just leave the ID completely out of it.  A 252 bit hash would fit in 42 base64 charachters, making your full URL 63 chars and giving you LOTS of room for growth.  And of course if you expired the references after a week and reused expired urls, you could get away with a much smaller hash.  On the other hand, if you can fit all the URL information you'll ever need into 252 bits, you could wrap ALL your urls in a two-way function which renders all URLs to under 63 chars including protocol, hostname and namespace prefix.  This would also obfuscate your website mechanisms, for better or worse.  Also, in the URL I'm lookign at there are 25 chars from GET variables: "?s=music&v=glance&n=5174".  Obviously those couldn't be included in a genereated URL without some client-side scripting, which would make site and code maintenance a nightmare.  Still, you might be able to compress the 75 chars of "gp/product/B0002LNJC8/qid=1137171588/sr=1-8/ref=sr_1_8/002-7168910-2564064" into "T/" and eight base64 chars comprising a 48 bit hash.  Then the URL I'm looking at would be "http://amazon.com/T/HASHHERE?s=music&v=glance&n=5174", where the HASHHERE would be the base64 representation of the hash/reference/whatever it is.

I heard Amazon uses a lot of perl, so wrapping long URLs in the reference scheme I'm describing would be incredibly easy from a programming point of view.  I have no idea what your network and application architechture are like, so there may be some other barrier to implementation I don't know about.

On the other hand, while I was typing all this up, I figured out that "gp/product/B0002LNJC8" is sufficient to link to a product, so The Simplest Thing would be to provide that as a short link.  Heh.  Still, my original idea would preserve all the tracking information marketing needs.

Anwyay, thanks for the awesome website.  Keep it real, work if you get write, don't take any wooden nickles (or greg nicols), and have a belated happy festivus.  If you use my idea, all I want in return is thanks.  If you don't use my idea, I won't be hurt or even surprised. :)

Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Balances your other class well"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "It was essentially a vocab quiz"
stormagnet says, "Most of which I knew before even entering the class"
stormagnet says, "Things like, whqat's a glottal stop? what's a fricative? what's a liquid consonant? etc."
Crag says, "The zaurus feed I found has a commodore 64 emulator called Frodo"
Crag nods re vocab, too
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Awesome"
stormagnet says, "I'd better wrap up and head to class"
stormagnet says, "I'll be back in the MOO in an hour or so :)"

stormagnet says, "The crazy Bulgarian has NOT ONLY just shuffled our seats AGAIN"
stormagnet says, "But she just tried to shuffle the GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR"
stormagnet says, "HINT:"
stormagnet says, "NO YOU MAY NOT SEAT HIM AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM. THERE ARE STAIRS."
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "The Bulgarian also appears entirely ignorant as to what the point of a SEMINAR is, as she seems bent on spending the entire period LECTURING"
stormagnet says, "On a topic that we ALREADY HAD A LECTURE ON"
stormagnet says, "YESTERDAY"
stormagnet says, "For fuck's sake"

Crag says, "The Zaurus SL-6000 really matches the Tosa Inu quite well"
Crag says, "Check this out"
Crag | http://www.shaku1.com/tosa2.htm
Crag says, "Damn, now I want a Tosa Inu"
Crag says, "They seem to me like the Japenese equivalent of the Irish Wolfhound in terms of impressiveness. :)"
Crag says, "Maybe not disposition"
Crag says, "Heh, just caught a line in one of the Harvey Danger songs: Could I please have the strength to change my mind?"
Crag says, "It looks like Tosas didn't come to the US until the late 50's or early 60's"
Crag says, "I believe the "Jack Palace" in that article is actually Jack Palance, who has a long and impressive page on imdb.com"
Crag says, "Tosas would make awesome police dogs"
Crag says, "Seeing as they're trained not to bite or bark"
Crag says, "Meep, there are only 350 Tosas in the Kochi prefecture"
Crag says, "I'm maxing out the CPU on wrack trying to run the zaurus emulator"
stormagnet says, "DOGS!!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "So, Tosa Inu basically translates to "Tosa dog breed", right?"
Crag says, "Does Inu mean both 'dog' and 'breed' depending on context?"
Crag . o O ( there will never be a Tosa for Nintendogs: the Tosa puppy wouldn't fit on the screen :) )
Crag . o O ( plus they would scare all the other dogs )
Crag says, "So far the emulator doesn't seem to be booting"
Crag says, "But it's still taking 100% cpu on wrack, so it must be doing something"
Crag says, "It's probably taking a long time to boot because of the overhead of instruction translation, and once it's seen all the code it will speed up."
That is not a valid command.
stormagnet says, "Yeah, 'Inu' is dog"
stormagnet says, "And if used with some other appellation, it makes the logical transition to meaning "Breed""
stormagnet says, "But, it seems they are not a breeed outright, in the scientific sense"
stormagnet says, "THey don't have standardized breed characteristics in that way"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "But the distinctyion doesn't really seem to exist in Japanese"
stormagnet typos like mad
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "In this case, Inu is the noun, or dog"
stormagnet says, "And Tosa is the adjetive"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "Japanese can turn pretty much anything into an adjective by using it that way"
stormagnet says, "So it means maybe something closer to 'type' or 'sort' or 'kind'"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "Shiba-Inu's, on the other hand, are a truly indigenous breed"
Crag says, "And the Shikoku Inu as well, I believe"
stormagnet says, "Their a national symbol and good-luch charm :)"
Crag says, "Naturally!"
stormagnet says, "I'm not familiar with the Shikoku Inu"
Crag says, "Your phone is going off"
Crag says, "Shikoku Inu was the Tosa before it was mixed with European dogs"
Crag says, "It was even called Tosa and was renamed as the new version gained popularity"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I got that from the article, but I'm not sure what they are"
stormagnet googles
Crag says, "they are pretty"
Crag says, "The zaurus emulator is booting now that I've fed it the correct images"

Crag says, "And I also forgot to fill in my time for last week, so last week's check will be late, I think"
Crag says, "I forget how that works exactly"
Crag says, "But I guess with a $12k balance we should be fine :)"
Crag says, "I may be gullibile, but I think the cop was impressed with me and went easy on me.  He clocked me doing 80, and I wouldn't be surprised if I'd gotten up to 82, but he put me down for 70."
Crag says, "HAW"

Crag says, "In other news, I got a friend request on MySpace from someone named Kimberly who has a nice looking picture posted."
stormagnet goes and hauls him out of Sancho's dish AGAIN

stormagnet says, "iih"
stormagnet says, "ahah"
Crag says, "heh, Marco"
stormagnet says, "I couldn't keep him from breaking out of the kitchen section, so I brought Sancho's bowl in here with me :) "

Crag says, "Of course."
stormagnet says, "Once I take down that garland over the door in the music room, thyough, I should be able to make that barricade more secure :)"

Crag says, "Cool"

stormagnet would just like to know how he maintains his girlish figure
stormagnet says, "Well, judging by the photostream, there's an acetelyne torch involved"
Crag says, "I didn't look at the whole stream"

Crag says, "Bad sportsmanship makes the baby jesus cry"
Crag says, "Seriously though, what do they hope to gain by bagging on the Hawks?"
Crag says, "It's not like they can change the outcome or sway opinion in their favor that way"
Crag says, "idiots"
stormagnet says, "What's worse, it's not the HAWKS they're bagging, it's SEATTLE ITSELF"
Crag ..

Crag shrugs.
stormagnet says, "I hope I'm not too late"
stormagnet had better check on Tuesday
Crag nods.
Crag says, "That would be a shame"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "The pdf schedule seems to have been updated with black-outs on classes that aren't accepting retgistration anymore, and Aikido is NOT one of them"
stormagnet says, "So that's good :)"
stormagnet says, "ANIMAL CROSSING IS ON THE WAY!!!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "The schedule might update on Tuesday, too"
stormagnet says, "True"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "There are other options"
stormagnet says, "Anyway, I should be studying"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "We'll figure something out"
Crag says, "Aw"
Crag says, "I guess I should be working, for that matter"
stormagnet says, "Worst case scenario, it waits until next quarter"

Crag says, "Oh hey!  I just remembered Jean says we get holiday pay today"
Crag says, "Not exactly overtime"
Crag says, "Just an extra 10 hours worth of pay"
Crag says, "ohwait"
Crag says, "That's double time, I guess :)"
Crag says, "So better than overtime"
Crag says, "Pretty funny considering how slow today is"
Crag says, "er, I guess tomorrow's the actual holliday.  Whatever."
Crag says, "Day's almost over..."
Crag says, "It's been SO slow."
Crag says, "It's not even a joke that all of our work is caused by other people in the company."
Crag says, "Ok, not all, but the bulk of it"
stormagnet says, "laughs"
stormagnet says, "meh"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Marco is jealous of my Nintendog"
stormagnet says, "I was just taking a study break to play with Rocky, and Marco spent the whole time leaning up and nuzzling me, headbutting my chin, etc"
stormagnet says, "So I petted him with one hand and played with the other"
stormagnet says, "When I was done, I left my DS on the coffee table"
Crag says, "Stereolab, Showbox, March 6th."
stormagnet says, "Turned around, went into the study..."
Crag . o O [ uh oh ]
stormagnet says, "Heard a clatter, and saw the DS on the floor, with Marco nowhere to be seen"
Crag snickers
stormagnet says, "and YAY STEREOLAB"
Crag says, "I think all that cat's mass comes from extra personality"
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "That, and Sancho's food"
Crag says, "I think he uses Sancho's food to feed his own ego"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "OOh- Four new episodes of Mai Otome, coming down the pipe"
stormagnet says, "The timing on that Stereolab performance is nice and close to your birthday, I notew :)"

Crag says, "yes, that had not escaped my attention"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "it's a Monday"
Crag hms
stormagnet says, "Last week of class for me before finals"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "We should probably skip it then"
Crag says, "They'll be back, though"
Crag says, "So your finals are the week of my birthday?"
stormagnet says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "But they'll be over by the day itself"
stormagnet says, "Well.. "
stormagnet checks
stormagnet says, "I think I might have one on the 16th, actually"
Crag says, "As long as we can go party the night of the 16th, I'm content."
Crag says, "I still have no idea what I want to do about my birthday."
Crag says, "Barb and I had talked about gigging"
stormagnet says, "I'll want to party HARD"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "And I'll have the week after finals off, I think"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "Maybe I should take March 19-22 off"
stormagnet says, "The rest of this Mountain Goats cd kind of sucks"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag fails to hide is smug look.
stormagnet says, "Suddap"
stormagnet says, "Shuddap, even"
Crag giggles.
stormagnet says, "Okay, I have two finals on the 16th"
stormagnet says, "But it's for my two super-easy classes, film and linguistics"
stormagnet says, "So no worries"
Crag says, "Great"
Crag says, "So now to figure out what we're going to do"
stormagnet grinnods
Crag says, "I've got no clue"
Crag says, "I should look at my progressed chart"
Crag says, "Moon and Venus in Pisces, Sun and Mercury in Aries, everything else the same"
Crag says, "Er, same as my natal chart"
Crag says, ":ponders"
Crag mavs
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I'd forgotten that term"
Crag says, "I'll never forget, I've got muscle memory for that one"
Crag says, "years upon years of typos..."
Crag says, "So as far as time off availablilty, I have 5 days left now."
Crag says, "Including two floating hollidays"
Crag says, "holidays"
Crag says, "So I _could_ take the week after the 16th off."
Crag says, "And if finances are good by then, we might could slip on down to Santa Cruz or something"
stormagnet says, "oooooh"
stormagnet says, "inDEED"
Crag says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I think a stress-free trip would cost $1000, including fun money"
Crag says, "But we could probably get it down to $500"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "heh, my mom is so out of touch"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "She sent me a link to a Steve Jobs speech, and I liked it so I replied"
Crag says, "I talked about how I had learned the lesson he was talking about (follow your bliss) and what about it was hard to implement"
Crag says, "And I happened to mention years of depression and diagnosis as ADD..."
Crag says, "And now she's gone full-on Liz on me."
Crag says, "Oh well"
Crag says, "Under my new world model I feel compelled to address all her points calmly and rationally, with links to supporting data."
Crag says, "So I may need some help on that data thing :)"
Crag says, "I started skipping paragraphs as soon as I realized she was flipping out"
Crag says, "But I did see that she thinks what I call Depression 'sounds more like guilt' and the solution to her guilt problems was a sticky note pad that says "Yes, I am depressed. But I don't let"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "don't let it get me down"
stormagnet says, "Ugh"
stormagnet says, "Jesus fucking christ"
Crag says, "As I said, she's out of touch"
stormagnet says, "That's a mild way of putting it"
Crag says, "But I am going to respond because it's possible that I may have a co-worker whom I have to work with who is out of touch, so I need the practice."
Crag says, "I'm trying to be kind :)"
stormagnet nods

stormagnet says, "I'm glad you"

stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "Do you reckon the liquor stores are open today?"
Crag says, "Aw crap... probably not"
Crag says, "I can check though"
Crag says, "I might as well just try the U village one since we know it's open on Sundays"
Crag says, "So if it's not open, none of them will be"
Crag says, "Or maybe they have a website?"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "They have a lot of info online"
Crag says, "But I'm not seeing holiday info"

stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Good"
stormagnet says, "That's my plan"
Crag says, "three more hours"

Crag laughs
stormagnet spits pretzel bits laughing at http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/01/04 
stormagnet says, "That strip is yet another reminder of why kids like me and my brothers should NEVER have been allowed the unsupervised leniency that we had. "
stormagnet says, "I am frankly SHOCKED that we made it to adolescence without any fatalities"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Maybe you didn't.  Maybe you had another sibling, and they died, and it was so terrible that everyone blocked it from their memories."
Crag says, "Heh, today's comic is good too :)"
Crag says, "Penny Arcade has uh... matured?  or something. :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Ummmm... crap"
stormagnet says, "So, Mahou Shoujo Tai has officially been subbed through to the end (episode 40)"
stormagnet says, "I downloaded episodes 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40"
stormagnet says, "Only"
stormagnet says, "We left off at episode 32"
stormagnet says, "And episodes 33, 34, and 35 seem to be nowhere to be found"
stormagnet says, "EXCEPT"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "In the bundled EPISODE 1-40 TORRENT"
stormagnet headdesks
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "good stuff"
stormagnet . o O ( there has GOT to be a way to get around that )
Crag says, "I'm sure someone must have the other episodes... somewhere"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Six minbutes and then I'm TOTALLY going back to studying"
stormagnet says, "Totally"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I won't try to keep you"
stormagnet idles: studying! really!
Crag says, "I hope I'm not being unrealistic, but my current estimate of the completion date for my project with Jean is March 26th."
Crag says, "The project is due by June 30th."
Crag says, "So I'm feeling pretty good about this at the moment."
stormagnet says, "the cats are mildly freaked out by the strange noises I'm making while doing my linguistics homework"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I only just found out we misspelled Gosalyn when we came up with that contrived backronym"
Crag says, "I'm going to leave it as is for now because I don't think we can come up with a backronym that uses 'y'."
stormagnet says, "BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHHAHA"
Crag says, "I'm heading home"
Crag says, "Anything messag for me before I go?"
Crag says, "message"

stormagnet totally missed her morning linguistics seminar
stormagnet says, "Fucking obnoxious impossible uncooperative gym-issued combination locks!!"
stormagnet says, "Why must they torment me?!"
stormagnet says, "Twice now"
stormagnet says, "TWICE"
stormagnet says, "Have I finished working out, showering, dressing, etc with a good half hour to go until class, only to have the stupid lock stop working"
stormagnet says, "REALLY stop working"
stormagnet says, "Like, the manager couldn"

stormagnet says, "War = Peace"
stormagnet >_<
stormagnet says, "She's wrong like a wrong thing"
stormagnet says, "Her basic facts on which her argument are founded aren't even right"
stormagnet says, "Women DID go on trips of their own"
stormagnet says, "Ergo, trying to defend their confinement as being a position of power is just wrong"
stormagnet says, "Wrong all the way down"
stormagnet is glad she got that out of her system
Crag says, "Hi!"
Crag says, "stupid prof.  plplplplt"
Crag says, "today is busy enough to keep me from doing project work.  Meh."
stormagnet says, "LAME"

stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet drew a funny doodle and made her laugh
stormagnet says, "She also seems impressed by my powers of recall, but she could just be being nice"
stormagnet . o O ( either way, it's a win! :) )
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Work it, girl!"
stormagnet says, "Wow, I just got a really convincing phishing email"
stormagnet is amused
Crag says, "Since she already laughed at your doodle in a friendly way, she has no chance of escape."
stormagnet checks the BofA site to see if they have an email to forward it to
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "You drank the beer!"
Crag says, "I'm sure BofA must have somewhere to send it"
Crag says, "beer?"
stormagnet says, "Now we have formed a cast-iron contract!!"
stormagnet says, "You owe me sex!!"
stormagnet says, "Hurry up, interest is accruing as we speak!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I think this is going to be a great year for both of us"
stormagnet says, "Yay, BofA does have an email for forwarding phishers"
stormagnet forwards
stormagnet says, "So, I found out what happened to my ID last week"
stormagnet says, "Stupid ^$@@%#@!! bitch at the towel counter had it"
stormagnet says, "The same one who gave me an interminable run around about signing up for a lock"
stormagnet says, "One of the things required for getting said lock (the one that made me late this morning, no less) was showing ID"
stormagnet says, "Which she then NEVER RETURNED"
stormagnet says, "And when I went back to get help with my first lock (which turned out to be broken) she asked me to show ID AGAIN"
stormagnet says, "When I told her my WALLET was in the LOCKER with the BROKEN LOCK, she said forget it, it's okay"
stormagnet says, "Rather than saying IT'S OKAY BECAUSE I STILL HAVE YOUR ID BUT FORGOT TO GIVE IT BACK TO YOU"
stormagnet says, "And the folks who printed me a new one?"
stormagnet says, "LIED about how much it cost"
stormagnet says, "It cost THIRTY dollars, NOT ten"

Crag says, "dude, that is fucked up right there."
Crag says, "That's an organization which could benefit from... EXECUTION: The Discipline Of Getting Things Done."

Crag says, "The organization in question being the UW"
Crag says, "I bet a lot of large orgs could use a swift kick in the execution area"
stormagnet would be MORE than happy to provide it
stormagnet says, "Also, my bTA is on CRACK"
stormagnet says, "TA, that is"
stormagnet says, "Big, fat rocks of it"
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet says, "He says we have a linguistics quiz due TODAY"
stormagnet says, "He is SMOKING"
stormagnet says, "There was a quiz due on FRIDAY"
stormagnet says, "And NO MENTION in lecture that day of any quiz due over the weekend"
stormagnet says, "Which makes extra sense, considering that the quiz the TA linked me to covers material that WE HAVEN'T HAD A LECTURE OR READING ON YET"
stormagnet thinks that it's kind of sad that she could probably take this quiz ANYWAY, if necessary
stormagnet says, "I think he has perhaps confused THIS week with NEXT week"
stormagnet says, "The prof. only has office hours listede on Monday, but I'm going to call him anyway"
stormagnet already sent a WTF?! OVER to the TA
stormagnet says, "Oh I see"
stormagnet says, "He sent an email out OVER THE WEEKEND"
stormagnet says, "DICK!!!"
stormagnet bangs head on desk. Repeatedly.
Crag says, "Not only could you take the quiz, I think you'd make a better TA."
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Thank you :)"
stormagnet says, "I have to write a paper for my Japanese class"
stormagnet says, "In, of course, Japanese"
stormagnet headdesks some more
stormagnet says, "I actually just finished it, only I forgot to add a part that I'd been planning to."
stormagnet REALLY does not care enough to go back and do it over.
stormagnet says, "I should go buy an itty-bitty stapler to keep in my locker"
stormagnet says, "We're supposed to staple ALL our homework together"
stormagnet says, "In one big lump"
stormagnet says, "Composition, kanji worksheets, workbook pages, lab manual pages, ALL lumped together, every day."
stormagnet sighs in frustration
stormagnet says, "AND DID I MENTION THAT THERE'S A TEST ON THURSDAY?!"
stormagnet . o O ( No wonder the Japanese put caffiene in EVERYTHING )
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I keep loosing my ssh connection to wrack.  How odd."
stormagnet says, "whoops, time for film class"

Crag says, "I assume I'll be picking you up at school Thursday and Friday night.  If you know when/where that will be, I can enter it into my calendar"
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet says, "Friday should be done by 4pm- so I'll have time to change for Die Fleidermaus"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "I should go to Kaiwa Table on Thursday, so that'll be more like 7pm"
stormagnet says, "Speaking of picking up"
stormagnet says, "It occurs to me that Rose will be stuck staying late at school for that film tonight, too"
stormagnet is pondering asking her to coffee after :)))))))
Crag says, "Dammit, I missed Colin Meloy on KEXP because of work"
Crag says, "I don't have Die Fleidermaus on my schedule, what's the timing on that?"
Crag says, "And 4pm on friday is great because I'm visiting the WOC until 4 on friday anyway"
Crag says, "And YAY DRINKS w/ ROSE!"
Crag says, "Oh wow, I didn't miss Colin afterall"
Crag says, "He doesn't play on the radio until 3pm"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Thursday timing is good too, becuase my drinks w/ Dan W appointment should be just finishing up around then."
Crag [to stormagnet]: In order to offer you the maximum Rose courting flexibility, I will wait to hear from you rather than calling you when I'm done recording.  If I finish up before you I'll go hang out somewhere and play with my zaurus or something.
Crag says, "It's my weekend, so it doesn't impinge on my plans at all."
stormagnet says, "Ooops"
stormagnet says, "I lied"
stormagnet says, "The film is NEXT Wednesday"
stormagnet says, "Though my scheme still stands"
stormagnet grins
Crag heh
Crag says, "Ok, I'll adjust my calendar"
Crag says, "And I'll probably be at home next Wednesday night."
Crag says, "Do you have something to do in the Udist while I'm recording?"
stormagnet says, "Study"
stormagnet says, "Why"
stormagnet says, "WHY"
stormagnet says, "Someone, tell me WHY"
stormagnet says, "We are having a lecture TODAY"
stormagnet says, "On something we had a TEST on"
stormagnet says, "YESTERDAY"
stormagnet says, "ARE THEY TRYING TO BREAK MY MIND?!?"
Crag says, "Life works that way.  It gives you the test first and then the lesson."
Crag says, "But that's no excuse"
Crag says, "I've just noticed a problem in the SOC's relationship to operations"
Crag says, "On the one hand they want us to solve problems, but on the other hand we're not supposed to make changes."
Crag says, "SO the only problems we can solve are those which are fixed by not making a change."
Crag says, "I'm over-simplifying of course, but it's still a problem."
Crag says, "I think there's some major disagreement on what the various groups' scopes are"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, ""
stormagnet says, "You guys' org chart must be non-Euclidian"
Crag heh
Crag says, "In reality, yes"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Whatever actual recorded org chart we have is probably a simple graph"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But is also completely disconnected from day-to-day operations"
stormagnet says, "Of course"
Crag says, "I'll think about it, maybe come up with some way to improve things"
stormagnet says, "You think those managers could handle non-Euclician geometry?"
stormagnet . o O ( jommetry )

Subject: having trouble specifying my development goal

Hi Allison,

I may be taking this too seriously, but I'm having trouble capturing my personal development goal in words.  As I understand it, a goal has an abstract expression, a concrete plan, a metric of success and ideas about how the company can help me in my efforts to meet the goal.

I'm focusing on a single goal right now.  I want to improve my interactions with people in the company.  I think I am insufficiently rigorous in listening and reading and overly verbose in speech and writing.

The problem I'm having is coming up with a concrete way to develop and measure these skills.

I do think the project with Jean ties in well with this goal since I we will need to communicate well in order to colaborate effectively.

Binder suffers the crushing heartbreak of the next line:  to order Girl Scout cookies. 
Binder says, "Oh, well, that'll be fine."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I'm sure it's a euphamism"
Binder says, "It's a euphonium.  TOOT."
Crag says, "You know... "GIRL SCOUT _COOKIES_""
Binder says, "Earlier today someone said to me:  I need to talk to you about a Thing."
Binder says, "which was, in fact, code for:  I have drugs."
Crag says, "That would have been my last guess"
Binder says, "Oh, the clever encipherment of the drug providing."
Crag says, "Whatever it takes, man"
Binder says, "Three pounds of hash and a case of whipped cream, generally."
Crag says, "Heavens"
Binder really must consider reconstructing his .tfrc someday.
Binder says, "Then if I really go crazy I could resume M*coding."
Crag says, "Well.."
Crag says, "There are so many projects to work on"
Crag says, "What's the status on the ShinyBBS project?"
Binder . o O (Amongst our projects are such elements as.)
Binder says, "It's been demoted to someday/maybe."
Binder says, "Pending my learning of Rails."
Crag says, "heh"
Binder says, "Because if I can't make a bbs on top of Rails?  I suck."
Crag says, "I have another project which displaces all other programming projects in my personal queue"
Binder finds himself switching between IM to Cerebus and here and doing a lot of " & : in IM and too few here.
That is not a valid command.
Binder says, "Trying to take over the world?"
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "Exactly, in fact"
Crag says, "It's a cross between mojonation, freenet, viruses/worms and an operating system"
Crag says, "I hope to have a proof-of-concept in Perl by the end of the year"
Binder 's head spins 180 degrees, then rewinds.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Here's the pitch"
Binder gets in the elevator.
Crag says, "Actually, even better than the pitch, do you remember when we talked about adaptive production networks?"
Crag says, "plug a server in, it netboots and does whatever's needed?"
Binder says, "Yes.  Of course."
Crag says, "I took that further"
Crag says, "The processes now are The Smallest That Could Possibly Work"
Crag says, "They Do One Thing Well"
Crag says, "And they use MojoNation-style economics to manage resources"
Crag says, "Networking is a feature provided by cells specialized in that"
Crag says, "It's sortof a biological model"
Crag says, "That's pretty much the whole idea"
Crag says, "I'll be posting my notes this weekend, and I'll send you a link when I do"
Crag says, "My first project in this will be a rudimentary MUD"
Binder will want to read those.
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You totally will"
Crag says, "It has all the buzzwords"
Binder says, "I like the domain modeling from bio space."
Crag says, "Distributed, platform independent, etc"
Crag says, "Language independent too"
Binder says, "Should be good for $100M VC.  :)"
Crag says, "That would be cool"
Crag says, "but for now I'm going the free/open route"
Crag says, "It touches on fads like the Symantic Web, too"
Crag says, "But the best part is that I can start small"
Binder says, "Yes, that's important."
Crag says, "I write a cell hosting platform in perl, and a few example cells in perl and shell"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "And then I try to get other people excited"
Crag says, "And then it explodes!!!"
Crag says, "BOOM"
Binder . o O (Messy!)
Crag says, "The cell interface is strictly stdin/stdout"
Crag says, "The platform provides all the resources"
Crag says, "And since it charges for them, units are accountable for their impact on the ecosystem"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "This thing is also a model for a practical implementation of anarchy"
Binder says, "Conway's Life as an operating system."
Crag says, "Yes"
Binder says, "Who will thrive, who will die?  TUNE IN NEXT CPU CYCLE!"
Crag says, "And in an N-dimensional space"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "The hosting platform has an incentive to respect the cells it hosts so they can operate well enough to keep paying for the resources they use"
Binder says, "The friendly landlord tenet."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "If the platform cheats, it will probably fail to impress other platforms"
Binder says, "The good neighbor tenet."
Crag says, "The cells have to behave well or the platform will drop them in favor of better ones"
Binder says, "The weed of crime bears bitter fruit, Riddler! tenet."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "And since all the protocols are open there's a market for improved service cells"
Crag says, "Of course, the protocols don't actually exist yet"
Crag says, "but whatever :)"
Crag says, "Of course, the cells need to colaborate to build trust information to optimize their interactions"
Crag says, "But that can be delegated too"
Crag says, "And then cells can consult multiple delegates and compare results"
Crag says, "It's all an aproximation of an ideal, but the degree of aproximation can be exactly calculated and the risk managed appropriately"
Crag says, "Also, there's no central authority for the medium of exchange used to pay for resource usage"
Crag says, "Any entity in the network can issue its own credits, and the values of those credits will be determined by the distributed knowledge of that 'bank' and its ability to convert those credits into other things"
Crag says, "Initially hosting platforms will be the only banks, but there's no reason why cells couldn't"
Crag says, "And naturally there will be an incentive to create cells which succesfully cheat, and there will be cells which try to increase the cost of cheating"
Crag says, "Etc"
Crag says, "But it's all explicit instead of being brushed under the rug"
Crag says, "Security through obsurdity"
Binder ponders.
Binder says, "Yeah, you might have something there."
Crag says, "I'm envisioning functional units about as complex as a 100-line perl script."
Crag says, "The first 10 lines load up the modules defining and connecting to the platform, the other 90 are the specialization, I guess"

Binder says, "The game itself is reasonably simple and interesting."
Binder says, "I have only played it once but would play it again if I were not as exhausted as I were last time."
Binder says, "Last time, I utteraly failed to evolve."
Crag says, "The description sounds fascinating"
Binder says, "Yes, it's got neat dynamics to it."
Binder says, "Utteraly?  When did I forget how to spell?"
Crag says, "just now, it seems"
Binder blames coffee.
Binder says, "It's not that I can't spell, it's that with this much caffeine, I can't be troubled to proof-read."
Crag says, "It's just MOO, why bother?"
Binder goes 'M00!'
Crag laughs
The verb :moo is nowhere to be found.

Crag says, "And the batteries in the UPS units were old"
Crag says, "So we lost power... completely"
Crag says, "In the main datacenter"
Binder gasps with knuckle to upper lip.
Crag says, "Several hours worth of outage to... pretty much everything"
Crag says, "Because all the network equipment is in there"
Crag says, "Much longer outage to some other stuff because the backup system is lame"
Crag says, "And of course, a lot of machines which were supposed to be off came back on"
Crag says, "And of course, a few machines that were supposed to be on didn't come backl"
Crag says, "Maybe they never will"
Crag says, "hee hee"

Binder isn't stopping you.
Binder hasn't played any Railroad Tycoon games.
Crag says, "I've played 2 and 3"
Crag says, "They're both windows games, so no love for you"
Crag says, "3 is really just 2 with improved UI"
Crag says, "But both are excellent"
Crag says, "Interesting, seemingly historicaly accurate, well designed, etc"
Binder says, "Hey, I run Windows."

Binder says, "On Ubuntu."

Binder says, "Thanks to my job."
Crag says, "nice setup"
Crag says, "I like VMware"
Crag says, "It's been a while since I've used it though"
Binder says, "It's gotten faster and less annoying."
Binder says, "And a little cheaper."
Binder says, "<$200."
Crag says, "They had a personal use version for under $100 when I had it"
Crag says, "I actually shelled out for it back then"
Crag says, "I doubt I could find my license now though"
Crag says, "That was like 6-7 years ago, I think"
Binder says, "Yeah, they've probably revamped their pricing model and certainly their license code generation algorithm since then.  ;)"
Binder says, "I bought it out of pocket because I'll be using it for a while, I'm sure."

stormagnet says, "There was a vending machine that had energy drinks"
Crag . o O ( but... )
stormagnet says, "But unlike EVERY OTHER VENDING MACHINE ON CAMPUS, it ONLY took cash"
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet headdesks
Binder says, "Vendway robbery."
stormagnet breaks the desk
stormagnet sidles away, whistling nonchalantly
stormagnet tuhs hair down over the mark on her forehead
stormagnet . o O ( tuh- tugging hair down over a head which has just sustained sufficient trauma to render it Learning Diabled? )
stormagnet . o O ( Diabled- disabling yourself on purpose in order to get an extra hour to take the exam in? )
Crag [to stormagnet]: I vote yes
Crag enters his vote in the Diabled voting machine.
stormagnet says, "I also found out that it is officially too late for me to switch out of the Insane Bulgarian's section"
Crag says, "at all?"
stormagnet nods grimly
Crag says, "oh well, you can still take it to the highest courts"
Crag says, "You have an open-and-shut case."
stormagnet says, "Unless I Diable myself, and get the Dean to make an exception"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I suppose that too is an option"
stormagnet puyts down the anvil
stormagnet . o O ( puyts? )
stormagnet . o O ( is that Russian? )
stormagnet . o O ( In Communist Russia, the anvil puts YOU down )
stormagnet . o O ( In Communist Russia, the exam takes YOU )
Crag says, "In communist russia, the people fall on their anvils."
Crag says, "and cayotes"
Crag says, "I wonder if the roadrunner chases the cayote ICR"
Crag says, "Wow, with friday freed up maybe I can move whatever's left on Navi to Wrack and start rebuilding navi"
Crag says, "Dare I hope? heh"
Crag [to stormagnet]: it just occurs to me that last weekend's power disaster probably wiped the orlando problems out of the leader's minds.  Sherry must be breathing easier. :)
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "AHA"
stormagnet just came up with an awesome kanji mneumonic for the year the Taiho Code was first written
stormagnet says, "701"
Crag [to Binder]: There were simultaneous mostly unrelated disasters in orlando.  A blade failure and a production environment that couldn't scale when Advertising did a big blitz.
Crag [to stormagnet]: How do you keep from confusing the year with the code?
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm too tired to figure out if you're punning
stormagnet says, "shi o ichi"
stormagnet says, "My mneumonic is 'salt market'"
stormagnet says, "And the Yoro revision can be Nanoha"
stormagnet says, "Like that ridiculous mahou-shoujo anime"
stormagnet says, "nana o hachi"
stormagnet says, "nanoha"
Crag says, "I don't think I was punning"
stormagnet says, "718"
stormagnet says, "The code is a set of laws, not a number"
Binder says, "My voice is my passport.  Verify me."
Crag says, "I meant your pnemonic code"
Binder [to Crag]: That's awesome, vis-a-vis the disasters.
Crag [to Binder]: Yes!
Crag says, "The more things change the more they stay the same"
stormagnet . o O ( pnemonic- pounding something into your head? )
Binder says, "WDIG:  Where Disasters are Integrated Goals."
Crag says, "that's pure comedy gold"
Binder [to stormagnet]: Clearly, you transcend mere Earth dictionaries.
Crag [to stormagnet]: Is the year the same as the mnemonic?
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "oh ok"
Crag says, "I thought you were coming up with ANOTHER number to remeber the FIRST number :)"
stormagnet [to Crag]: And the founding of Nara wreites itself
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Nannichi ni?
stormagnet says, "In what day?"
stormagnet says, "712"
Crag tries to make an understanding, interested face.
Crag blinks.
stormagnet says, ""Aheh"
Crag stares.
Crag [to stormagnet]: :)
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet eyes the clock
stormagnet's alarm goes off as she types that
stormagnet . o O ( dammit )
stormagnet says, "Okay"
Binder says, "Batman!  The stormagnet alarm!"
Crag laughs!
stormagnet idles: FUCKING EXAM
Crag [to Binder]: Stormagnet could be a cross between Magneto and Storm...
Crag says, "Love child, perhaps?"
Binder fans himself.
Crag heh
Crag . o O ( hate child! )
Crag says, "ugh"
Crag says, "And this is why I don't read comics :)"
Binder is picturing Magneto's helm with St. Elmo's fire around it.
Crag says, "er, I mean 'graphic novels'"
Binder says, "Not enough b00bies?"
Crag says, "nerdyness"
Binder says, "Oh, right."
Crag says, "Comics (except for Cerebus, obviously) exceed my nerditory capacity"
Binder says, "Because you run with an upscale crowd?"
Crag says, "or something"
Binder tries to think of comics like Cerebus which are worth reading.
Binder says, "Finder, maybe."
Crag says, "It's probably best that I not look for things to be interested in"
Crag says, "Because my someday/maybe is already almost 200 items and they are all much too important to be pruned."
Binder chuckles.
Binder says, "Yes.  I have the same issue."
Binder says, "But that hasn't stopped me from seeking out more cool stuff."
Crag says, "It's the curse ofthe brain"
Crag says, "you're a glutton"
Binder says, "Yes.  Inbraintiable."
Crag says, "Those French - they have a word for everything"
Binder says, "Give it a name."
Crag says, "Evan"
Crag says, "Nowai..."
Crag says, "Horace!"
Binder says, "Snake Pliskin?  I heard you were dead!"
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'big trouble'.
Crag gives Vylar an xp for 'ankle sharks'.
Crag [to Binder]: One more blast-from-the-past for you:  The CC (now called the SOC) still uses my sitescope aggregator.  One of the new people wrote a replacement, but it's only been a complete replacement for a couple months and the old one still works fine, of course.
Binder [to Crag]: Hooray!
Crag says, "And today!"
Crag says, "Just now"
Crag says, "Someone on the network team 'fat fingered' a change and took down every service hosted behind the CSMs"
Crag says, "So basically everything"
Crag says, "For five minutes"
Binder says, "WOO."
Binder says, "User error is a feature."
Binder says, "It provides more work for automators."
Crag says, "and managers"
Binder says, "Hey, manager's kids got to eat, too."
Binder says, "They won't have perfect teeth and glossy coats on their own."
Crag says, "let them eat cake!"
Binder says, "Mmmm.  Cake."
Binder bets he has pie in his lunch today.
Binder says, "Leftovers from National Pie Day."
Crag says, "I MISSED NATIONAL PIE DAY?!"
Crag says, "that is not acceptable"
Binder says, "http://www.piecouncil.org/national.htm"
Binder puts it into Mosuki & remind so he won't risk not remembering next year.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Service Desk still behaves poorly when there are more than a couple dozen items to work with"
Crag says, "150+ is far too many"
Binder says, "Bleah."
Binder says, "Service Desk."
Crag says, "I almost put 'http://www.piecouncil.org/national.htm' as the solution to the 15 tickets I'm colapsing :)"
Crag . o O ( this problem with the network - it was solved by a national pie day )
stormagnet crawls back in, bruised and battered, but potentially triumphant
stormagnet needs her .tfrc more than ever, she sees
Line 1:  syntax error
1 error.
Crag hugs stormy
stormagnet hugs!
Crag [to stormagnet]: /recall 1000
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "or however many lines you want"
Crag says, "And /more on"
stormagnet used the screen scrollbuffer
Crag says, "That'll work"
stormagnet says, "But I want that scroll-only-on-tab thing back"
Crag says, "THat's /more on"
stormagnet does so
stormagnet is a moreon
stormagnet says, "I still need cake"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "'It' wants cake"
stormagnet says, "Indeed"
stormagnet says, "So the prof seems to have Toggled Drug Use"
stormagnet says, "And has extended the deadline on this week's paper to Monday"
stormagnet says, "So I might survive this week afterall"
stormagnet lights incense
stormagnet scatters a fitful of names, dates, and Big Words on her exam paper
stormagnet claps twice
stormagnet starts chanting
stormagnet says, "namuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsunamuamiddhabutsu"
Crag [to stormagnet]: is that another numeric mnemonic?
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "No, but that guess is PURE AWESOME"
Crag . o O ( from concentrate! )
stormagnet says, "Basically, it's "Praise the Amiddha Buddha""
Crag says, "Ahh. I see."
stormagnet says, "Now, I will catch my breath, read something funny"
stormagnet says, "And then start studying for TOMORROW'S exam"
stormagnet . o O ( an exam every day of the week, and it's not even a month into the quarter @_@ )

Smoke begins to trickle out stormagnet's ears.
Binder says, "Renounce the concerns of the world and raise a barn."
stormagnet laughs!
Binder has something stuck in his teeth.
Binder drops a Generic Fuzzy Animal.
Binder says, "Oh, that's better."

Binder [to Crag]: Yes.
Binder says, "But, regrettably, without drugs."
Crag says, "hee hee"
Crag says, "VR Studios (toontown) job interview postponed pending rescheduling of the VRS managers' visit to Seattle."
Crag says, "So now my week is COMPELTELY free"
Crag says, "And I have a haircut scheduled for nothin'"
Crag kicks sand
Crag says, "Oh well, I need the haircut anyway"
Binder says, "Ya hippie."
Binder says, "Getta haircut!"
Binder should probably get his haircut soon.
Binder says, "If only because I have it done by a California girl."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I wish they all could be Californian Girls."
Binder says, "And how."
Binder says, "Her name is Kendall Lockerby."
Binder says, "And she looks like a Kendall Lockerby."
Binder says, "i.e., Barbie's fussier but erogenous-zone-equipped cousin."
Crag fans himself.
Crag says, "And on that note I'm outa here."
Binder says, "Hasta."
Crag says, "Be back in about 14 hours :)"
Binder hehs.
Binder will just sit here and stare at the wall in the interim.
Crag idles: Your Ad Here!
[Idling at 4:05 P.M. on Tue, Jan 24: Your Ad Here!]
Crag says, "Well!"
Crag says, "I have already got the beginnings of my cell thing"
Crag says, "I have a platform.pl which invokes cell.pl as three separate processes and talks to them via IPC::Open2() filehandles using IO::Select to do the stupid select() crap"
Crag says, "I'll be posting it tonight or tomorrow, along with my notes so far"
Binder says, "WOOH.oo."
Binder says, "Sorry, ran out of breath midway through my woo."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I'm very excited about this project"
Crag says, "I've basically put 90 minutes into slapping together these two perl scripts"
Crag says, "And already I'm getting useful info"
Crag says, "Mostly through man pages, but whatever"
Crag says, "I don't look gift docs in the mouth"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Starting projects is rewarding.  Finishing them, moreso, but I don't under-rate starting as a boon."
Crag grins.
Binder was asked today if he reads a book a day.  Um.  No.
Binder is managing a book a week and that's doing well to fit THAT in.
Crag says, "If I had time to read a book a day, I still wouldn't read a book a day."
Binder probably would.
Binder says, "I'm perturbed that books which interest me are published faster than I can read them and, even, faster than I can purchase them."
Binder may subscribe to O'Reilly's Safari just to try to grep ahead of the curve.
Crag says, "OMG, my BS meter just spiked so hard the needle snapped."
Crag says, "Email from Bob Iger:"
Crag | [merging with pixar] gives us infinite potential for creating [blah blah]
Crag says, "INFINITE?!"
Binder says, "DOUBLE INFINITE!"
Binder says, "QUADRUPLE INFINITE PLUS N POTENTIAL!"
Crag says, "I wonder if they have to report Infinite Potential to the IRS"
Binder says, "Well, they can START reporting it but they will never, ever finish reporting it."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "There'll be somebody who is the designated liaison to the IRS and their job will be to be constantly on the phone reciting digits."
Crag says, "poor bastard"
Crag says, "674234237... that was two three seven... SEVEN... DAMMIT! ARG! *BANG* *flop*"
Crag . o O ( because infinities are non-repeating decimals... obviously )
Binder says, "Clearly."
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet is SO SLEEPY
stormagnet is about to meet with the Insane Bulgarian
Binder says, "Fun!"
stormagnet says, "You have No idea"
stormagnet has a sudden, pressing urge to reread The Trial
Binder says, "Why re-read it when you can live it?"
Crag says, "hee, stormy!"
Crag [to Binder]: Can, and is!
Crag says, "Lately as I'm programing I catch myself making unhelpful assumptions about the problems my code solve"
Crag says, "And there's a gleeful moment where I delete unnecessary stuff"
Crag says, "I think the things you've told me and that I've read about XP are really sinking in"
Binder says, "Hooray!"
stormagnet says, "And, I have confirmed my hypothesis"
stormagnet says, "I am but a humble student, and I was willing to acknowledge that I may actually have misunderstood the material as badly as all that"
stormagnet says, "But no"
Crag says, "My code is getting 'tighter'"
Crag [to stormagnet]: ...
stormagnet says, "Her English just plain sucks"
stormagnet says, "And she is unwilling to admit it"
Crag says, "oooo"
Crag says, "That would explain the speach at the beginning of the class"
Crag says, "About the feedback and stuff"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Tell me more about your tight... code"
Crag says, "I bet when you take this to the authorities it will be a back-breaking straw"
stormagnet laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: it's reeeel tight, baby
stormagnet says, "Well, I'm willing to wait and see first"
Crag says, "To talk to her you mean?"
stormagnet says, "After all, it was only one paper and one quiz, and I got an 80% and a 90% respectively"
Crag says, "Or wait for something else?"
stormagnet says, "No, I did talk to her"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "All her feedback boiled down to - "It wasn't clear enough""
stormagnet says, "So, I'm just going to write Dick-and-Jane style and parrot the textbook"
stormagnet says, "If THAT doesn't work, THEN I'll complain formally"
Crag says, "I guess that's the mature/professional approach"
stormagnet says, "If it DOES work, I'll just note it on her evaluation at the end of the quarter"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet: The Professional
Crag says, "And you're not in danger of the kind of procrastination that I am"
Crag [to stormagnet]: totally
That is not a valid command.
Crag . o O [ HOT HOT HOT ]
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "The more I apply what Shannon has taught me about minimalist code, the easier it gets"
Crag [to Binder]: and we never actually coded together.  It was all converations.
stormagnet gives Binder an xp for 'guru'.
Crag says, "At least, not in any serious way"
Crag one-ups stormy...
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'XTREME GURU'.
stormagnet says, "okay, time for me to take some notes"
stormagnet says, "may or may not be back before the end of this lecture"
stormagnet idles: noteworthy
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Jenny totally covered for me almost the entire morning"
Crag says, "I asked her if I could bring her curry but she said not to, that it's not necessary."
Crag says, "What is it with these super nice people!"
Binder says, "They're plotting against you."
Crag says, "that would just figure"
Binder tries to remember Jenny.
Binder says, "Do I know Jenny?"
Crag says, "Jenny Lin!"
Crag says, "WHo's SUPER EXCITED!"
Crag says, "And has no ambitiou"
Binder says, "Hm, the name sounds familiar."
Crag says, "amnbition either"
Crag says, "meh"
Binder can't place a face to it.
Crag says, "Asian?  Thin?"
Binder says, "Clearly, I'm repressing my entire WDIG career."
Crag says, "She remembers you, so you should feel guilty or something"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's fair I suppose"
Binder says, "Though I do remember something about playing Animal Crossing on a ceiling mounted TV at work around Yule."
Crag says, "Jenny is our one remaining SQL person on the team"
Crag laughs again
Binder says, "OH yes.  SQL Server."
Binder says, "Double plus repressed!"
Crag says, "Right, MSSQL as opposed to a real database"
Binder says, "Man, I hate MSSQL."
Binder shudders.
Crag says, "As well you should"
Binder says, "The last job made me do MSSQL 'dba' tasks."
Crag says, "ugh"
Binder says, "Which was really the last straw in inducing my quit."
Binder says, "DEAR EUROTRASH VC:  do not hire a Linux admin to do Linux admin and then make him do MSSQL, he will quit and ignore your pleading emails for help.""
Binder says, """""
Crag says, "It would have been one thing or another"
Crag says, "But yeah, that's a doosey"
Binder says, "I put up with a lot of shit there before that."
Crag says, "Please mr. piano man!  Play guitar for us!  Please?!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Windows Server admin, Windows desktop IT, pulling cable, going to buy the coffee and donuts, making the coffee."
Binder says, "But when it became clear to me that the Windows stuff would never, ever end, I walked."
Crag says, "ANd you found a great place to go"
Binder says, "Yes I did."
Binder says, "It is the best place I've worked in the SF area so far."
Crag says, ""nice"
Crag says, "Ok, lunch time!"
Crag idles: 'M' for Mealtime, munch, munch, munch.  Mmm, these greens are good for lunch!
[Idling at 11:58 A.M. on Wed, Jan 25: 'M' for Mealtime, munch, munch, munch.  Mmm, these greens are good for lunch!]
Crag says, "Meh, lunch can wait"
Binder says, "Why?"
Binder says, "WHY WAIT FOR LUNCH?"
Binder is, yes, projecting.  Yes, again.
Binder can't break for lunch just yet, boss just got here.
stormagnet is So. Fucking. Sleepy.
Crag says, "I'm having fun writing a skeleton perl script for OPenView monitors for *nix machines"
Crag says, "re-writing, actually."
Crag says, "but whatever"
stormagnet says, "tonight is going to SUCK"
Crag frowns.
stormagnet says, "OMFG!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "Rose is my own personal Jesus Christ"
stormagnet says, "She bought a copy of the crazy rare film we're supposed to stay late and watch today"
stormagnet says, "On eBay"
stormagnet says, "And she offered to share!!!"
stormagnet *o*
stormagnet says, "And the professor confirmed that, although we'll be discussing it in section on Friday, as long as we watch it before the next exam, we'll be okay!!!"
stormagnet . o O ( Whjich also gives us a clue as to the *content )
stormagnet says, "grr"
stormagnet . o O ( CONTENT of the next exam )
stormagnet . o O ( which is supposed to be seeeekrit )
stormagnet <3<3<3
stormagnet says, "I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT"
Binder says, "Yay?"
stormagnet says, "YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
stormagnet [to Binder]: Crqazy prof was making us stay late today- from 6pm to 9pm- to watch a madatory film that has been out-of-print for fucking EVER
Crag!
stormagnet [to Binder]: Which we now also know WILL be on the exam
Crag [to stormagnet]: Holy cow
stormagnet nodnods!!
Crag says, "Her place or ours? :)"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "Up for debate ^_^"
Crag says, "hee hee"
Crag says, "Once she meets the cats, she will be helpless"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet [to Crag]: any ETA from Martha yet?
stormagnet [to Crag]: OH! AND I got your email
stormagnet [to Crag]: Today is SO GOOD
stormagnet takes back every mean thing she ever said about Today
stormagnet repents on bended knees
Binder . o O ( ... )
Binder says, "So on that note, I think I'll break for lunch."
Binder idles: lunch now!
Crag [to stormagnet]: Last I heard from Martha was 7-9 and I don't think we're going to get anything more specific than that
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Crag]: So, I might even get home early enough to clean up a bit
stormagnet says, "Oh, goody!!"
stormagnet says, "This lecture bodes humorously"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "This WHOLE LECTURE is on MORPHEMES"
Crag says, "I love that band"
Crag sings, "ruby red..."
stormagnet says, "Also, such gems as "Take the word 'quickly' - now k doesn't mean anything, and 'wick' doesn't mean anything..."
Crag hums along with the horn section
Crag says, "also wick..."
Binder returns with lunch.
Binder says, "Breakroom was full."
Binder says, "So I'm eating my borscht here at my desktable."
Binder pulls meaningless wicks out of his candles.
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet bites her lip to keep from laughing
stormagnet says, "Every time he says 'free morpheme', I have to resist the urge to cheer"
stormagnet <- Peanut Gallery
stormagnet says, "Dammit"
stormagnet says, "AGAIN with the antidisestablishmentarianISM as the longest word"
stormagnet says, "ISTS, dammit!"
stormagnet says, "And we shall continue to ignore all scientific terms, shall we"
Crag says, "but... what about pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?"
Crag says, "It took me two days to memorize that"
stormagnet LAUGHS!!
Crag says, "I won't be having any nonsense about how it's a word made up to displace antidisestablishmentarianists."
Crag . o O ( as the longest word )
stormagnet says, "Or, how about antidisestablishmentarianistss'?"
That is not a valid command.
Crag <- antidisembowlinaist
stormagnet says, "OMG, Schoolhouse Rock!!!!!!"
stormagnet LOVES her some ADJECTIVES
Crag grins.
stormagnet Gir voices, "This is my favorite class!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I still can't tell if this guy is a comedic genius ON ACCIDENT or ON PURPOSE"
stormagnet says, "Either way, I think he is quite possibly the Best Sport Ever"
stormagnet says, "When the class starts laughing, he does this sort of nervous half-laugh thing that is PRICELESS"
stormagnet says, "PURE GOLD"
stormagnet hides behind her laptop as she doubles over, twitching silently
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I bet he likes the attention"
Binder says, "Hams!  In!  Claaaaaass!"
Binder says, "Man, I have the BEST candy."
Binder says, "Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer Menthol Throat Drops."
Crag says, "Sounds... interesting..."
stormagnet says, "Oooh Ohh!"
stormagnet says, "Time for..."
stormagnet says, "NEWS"
stormagnet says, "OF"
stormagnet says, "THE OBVIOUS!!"
stormagnet  WORK STRESS LEADS TO HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES
Crag nods solemnly.
Binder doubts that.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "Though I seem to have [more or less] beat back glucose intolerance for the moment."
Binder says, "My doctor, Dr. Hippiechick, says I'm showing no signs of sugar excess in the short term but I'm still coming down from an extended period of abuse."
Binder <- sugar junkie
Crag [to stormagnet]: So that's good news, right?
Crag says, "er"
Crag [to Binder]: So that's good news, right?
Binder [to stormagnet]: Tell -Crag- that, yes, that's good news.  And, also, I'm not talking to him!
Binder turns to his boss to say:  stop crunching so loud! but stops realizing that not only can his boss not hear those words, the reason he is crunching so loud is that he is wearing headphones and thus can not hear the crunching he is making.
Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: is 'Hippiechick' your Doctor's maiden name? :)
Binder says, "No, no, she's married."
Binder says, "Though I suspect she was a Hippiechick when still a maiden."
Binder says, "She's coltishly hot."
Binder says, "Sort of built like, hmm.  Nicole, kind of.  But +15-20 years old."
Crag says, "Interesting."
Binder says, "Glasses, prone to skirts."
Binder says, "Could appear in librarian pr0n, et cetera."
Crag says, "Sounds like stormy's type..."
Binder says, "Also, she wants me.  Like all doctors do."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Well, if you guys move down here, the clinic she works in is walking distance from the Lair."
Crag says, "It's certainly a possibility"
Binder says, "I don't actually chose my physician based on hotness, but I do tend to luck in."
stormagnet has LUNCH!!
Binder [to stormagnet]: What's for lunch?
stormagnet is, in fact, able to lunch today.
stormagnet [to Binder]: BOWL NOODLE
stormagnet NROMs
Crag [to stormagnet]: So does Rose's purchase and offer alter your schedule tonight?
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet [to Crag]: I can leave at 5pm now, like NORMAL
Crag says, "ok"
Binder goes NROM NROM NROM like the Gauntlet Warrior.
Crag shoots the food.  Again.
Binder was so disappointed with Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows.
Binder says, "Stupid stupid stupid game."
Crag says, "there are a lot of crap games out there"
Crag says, "I don't think I would bother with games at all if it weren't for gamefly"
Binder says, "I hear you."
Binder says, "I think in the two years before Gamefly I bought maybe six games total."
Binder says, "And all but two of those I'd played before."
Binder says, "Buying new games is such a crapshoot."
Binder says, "And 80% of the field is crap.  To shoot."
Binder says, "Wait, I told it wrong."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Even the good games are only just barely worth it without the gamefly discount"
Crag says, "I could pay $60 for one adequate game or two to ten great books"
Crag says, "But then, we're not the target audience, either"
Binder says, "Yeah.  We're not post-literate."
Binder says, "u & i cn tlk rill english  LOL"
Binder . o O ( Dude, I am -so- over literature. )
Crag heh
Binder tries to remember games he has bought since moving to SF.
Binder says, "Hmm, We Love Katamari for ps/2.  Pokemon Dark somethingorother, GC.  Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, GC.  Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, GC."
Binder says, "Oh, Super Monkey Ball 4, GC."
Binder says, "Tales of Symphonia, GC."
Binder says, "That might be it."
Crag says, "Tales of Symphonia is highly entertaining"
Crag says, "Cheezy, but amusingly so"
Binder says, "Shh, don't tell Vy, but a related game, Tales of Legendia is out 2/9."
Binder has put it in the Gamefly queue.
Crag says, "woo!"
Crag adds it to the queue
Crag says, "Not showing up for me on gamefly"
Crag says, "GC or PS/2?"
Crag says, "Ah, found it"
Crag says, "PS/2 only so far I guess"
Binder says, "Probably a gc release in <6 months."
Binder says, "Namco loves the gc."
Binder says, "I didn't even look at the platform, sorry.  I think I automatically screen out seeing anything which isn't for ps/2 or gc."
Crag [to Binder]: we have a PS/2 now
Crag says, "After the xbox died I was so pissed I decided to buy one out of spite"
Crag says, "My anger at the xbox outweighed my anger at Sony/BMG"
Crag says, "There was a lot of anger floating around"
Binder says, "GEEK RAGE!"
Binder says, "GEEK RAGE!"
Crag says, "RAR!"
Binder says, "I didn't know your xbox gave up the ghost."
Binder says, "I have a ps/2 because PhenoNate@junkbbs loaned us his."
Crag says, "It had the standard harddrive failure"
Binder says, "As he no longer has a tv."
Crag says, "Ah"
Binder says, "Oh, a Normal Error."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "The kind which causes regular people to just upgrade"
Crag says, "And causes me to swear never to buy etc."
Binder says, "Oh, dang, this broke.  I know, I'll give the people I bought it from MORE MONEY!"
Binder says, "That'll teach them a lesson!"
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "Maybe it broke because they didn't get enough out of me the first time!"
Binder says, "I need there to be a new console system."
Crag says, "They lose money on every unit sold!"
Crag says, "I read it on teh interweb!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Come oooooon, Revolution."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "we'll see"
Binder says, "I am intrigued by the XGS but that would be for playing -with- not playing -on-."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Arguably, it's good that MSFT is now in the field with Sony + Nintendo, to motivate them."
Crag says, "sure"
Binder says, "In practice, though, it seems like three colors of the same shit."
Crag says, "of course"
Binder says, "I gather much of the drive and energy these days is no longer console or even Windows platform orbiting.  It's mobile devices."
Binder says, "Which would be nice.  More players in the mobile device market."
Binder says, "Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Virgin, Sony-Ericsson, RIM, Palm, Compaq, Sharp..."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "The DS is surprisingly playable for its size"
Crag says, "But there's a lot of traditional effects that just wouldn't work at that scale"
Crag says, "I can't get immersed in a couple of animated business cards."
Crag says, "No matter how cute the animation..."
Crag looks at stormagnet.
Crag says, "But clearly there's some kind of market there"
Crag says, "On the other hand, something more Zaurus-like... could work"
Binder says, "Or something with, you know, peripherals which were non-obnoxious."
Binder says, "Bluetooth VR goggles."
Crag says, "oh yeah, good thinking"
Binder says, "Until the engine itself is light enough to put into the goggles."
Crag says, "Something goggly could be very immersive"
Crag says, "ANd obviously it could integrate headphones."
Binder says, "People are already [at least around here] falling into their own cocoon spaces in public."
Binder says, "They put their iPod buds in their ears and go obvlivious."
Crag says, "No harm in that! :)"
Binder says, "Taking their vision is the next logical step."
Crag says, "Would certainly make public transit more tollerable"
Binder says, "I had an idea for a mmorpg which was sort of SCA like."
Crag says, "Assuming one isn't susceptible to motion sickness"
Binder says, "You play on mobile devices with geolocation ability."
Binder says, "So where you physically are determines where in the world you are."
Crag says, "Interesting"
Binder says, "The kinds of things which would happen to your character."
Crag says, "Sortof LARPy too"
Crag says, "LARP + portable console + wireless + geolocation ..."
Crag says, "and goggles... and a ponie."
Crag says, "er, pony even"
Crag . o O ( stupid perl mailing lists, confusing me! )
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Lots of new territory to play with there."
Binder says, "It's on my m/s list as a project."
Crag says, "That's a good one"
Binder says, "Much less important than things I'm already doing."
Crag says, "Wouldn't take much to experiment with"
Crag says, "Assuming one doesn't mind springing for the GPS and wireless equipment, obviously"
Crag says, "You could do a neat alternate universe thing"
Crag says, "A little like Neverwhere"
stormagnet pops in long enough to say, "Damn, that sounds cool."
stormagnet goes back to homework ^_^;
Crag heh
Binder says, "Rainebait!"
Binder says, "Well, my cell phone theoretically has enough geolocating capability to localize me to some degree."
Binder says, "So if I could pull that out via its web browser, say, I could prototype it without spending any money."
Binder says, "Or put a python engine for Symbian on it."
Binder says, "It's just a time/effort expenditure, not cash money."
Crag says, "and if not, there's probably SOME phone out there that would do the job for under $200"
Crag says, "And would double as a phone"
Crag says, "Which would be handy in-game too"
Binder says, "HEH."
Binder says, "Like the Second Life objects which let you surf the web from inside Second Life."
Crag says, "sure"
Binder says, "This is me, watching me, watching me, watching me."
Crag says, "My brother-in-law is fascinated by Second Life"
Crag says, "I'm still reserving judgement"
Crag says, "What I've seen so far doesn't even amount to a near-miss in my book"
Binder says, "Yeah, I only know about Second Life second-hand [hah!]."
Crag grins.
Binder says, "It's a local company so it makes the local paper sometimes."
Binder says, "And there's all the blogs dedicated to it."
Crag says, "No unix client yet, so clearly it can wait to get my attention"
Crag says, "Or maybe there is, I haven't checked this week"
Binder says, "I sometimes think of playing and then I remember:  wait, I have MUDs, why would I pay money for this?"
Binder did buy Neverwinter Nights and install it on the last work laptop.
Binder says, "It was cute but I had other stuff going on."
Binder says, "So I never got much into it."
Binder should reinstall it.
Crag says, "Heh, their newsletter is called Second Opinion. :P"
Binder says, "Actually, what I -should- do is buy myself a new home desktop and use THAT for my personal stuff."
Crag says, "I think it's free if you don't want to write any code or build anything or... do anything interesting. :)"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Crag groans
Crag says, "THey have an OS X client but no Linux"
Crag says, "LAZY ASS BASTARDS"
Crag says, "But that just confirms my original conclusion that They're Not Our People and They Don't Get It"
Binder says, "They haven't figured out how to make money from Linux users."
Crag says, "Obviously"
Crag says, "And yet supposedly their business model is selling hosting services"
Crag says, "People pay to have SL host their portion of the SL universe"
Crag says, "So why should Linux users be any different?  Because we're more likely to reverse engineer their protocol and implement our own SL servers?  ... heh"
Crag says, "We don't need their stupid crap anyway"
Crag says, "CrystalSpace is coming along nicely"
Crag says, "And my bio-economic programming model will provide a far more powerful and scalable back-end"
Crag says, "But enough of that, back to work"
stormagnet says, "Excellent"
stormagnet says, "It would appear that today's lecture is by The Stupid One"
stormagnet says, "Comics time!"
stormagnet says, "w00t!"
stormagnet says, "It has just been announced that we are being graded on a curve!"
stormagnet says, "Oh crap- smart prof is talking"
Binder stares at ftp.opensuse.org.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I hate when that happens.
Crag says, "stupid smart profs"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Yeah, now I have to pay attention"
stormagnet says, "Grrrr"
Binder is conflicted.
Binder wants to attend CodeCon and Maker Faire.
Binder says, "But both are selling tickets through TicketWeb."
Binder grrr
stormagnet says, "Okay, stupid prof is taking over"
stormagnet says, "back to comics"
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "Just wow"
stormagnet says, "This prof officially can't remember if the character he's discussing is male or female"
stormagnet can't MAKE this shit up
Crag grnis.
Crag [to Binder]: What's Maker Faire?
stormagnet says, "Did I mention that one of this week's topics is GENDER ROLES?"
stormagnet says, "And he CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT GENDER THE CHARACTER IS"
Crag says, "This... means something... I know it."
Crag [to himself]: why are you still at work
Crag wimpers
Crag says, "OK"
Crag says, "I can leave now"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm comin' ta GETCHA
Crag idles: Sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset...
[Idling at 4:30 P.M. on Wed, Jan 25: Sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset...]
Binder [to Crag]: http://makezine.com/faire/
Binder says, "It's like a science fair for grownups."
Binder idles: AFK
Binder cracks his neck.
Binder.  Requires.  Coffee.  STAT.
Binder says, "Oh, hey, I have some.  How'd That Happen?"
Crag resumes this process.
Crag [to stormagnet]: It is a mystery.
Binder eyes Crag.
Crag [to Binder]: GOod morning
Crag [to Binder]: So is this playfirst.com thing any good?  Should I sign up for the preview thing you posted about?
Crag says, "And perhaps your coffee came from magical coffee gnomes."
That is not a valid command.

Binder snickers.
Binder [to Crag]: A lot of the games on the Playfirst site are cute and some are even interesting.
Binder [to Crag]: So if you have a Windows instance, try playing some of the free-to-play versions of them.
Binder [to Crag]: That'll let you know if the FirstPeek is worth signing up for to you.
Binder codes the ability to bleed a bagel in some froglegs.
Binder [to stormagnet]: you should make a way to write a player on a knife.
Crag says, "ok"
Binder says, "Hey, that's a great idea."
stormagnet wakes
Crag says, "WOW!"
stormagnet muches Pocky
Binder has the magic touch.
Crag [to Binder]: You have some kind of power
Crag loses
stormagnet laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm going to do my work catchup stuff from home
stormagnet says, "Awesome!"
stormagnet ^_^
Binder says, "I have played Diner Dash from PlayFirst and it's kind of mindless fun."
Crag [to stormagnet]: So it really doesn't matter when you need me to pick you up
Crag [to Binder]: I like fun.  Mindless or otherwise.
stormagnet [to Crag]: How'd the haircut go?
Binder says, "And I played some Tradewinds 2 and it was intriguing."
Crag [to stormagnet]: Fine.  Nothing to report.
Binder says, "I have positive reports concerning Oasis but have not played it, myself."
stormagnet . o O ( he's been shaved bald, I know it! )
Binder says, "There are also the staple card games."
Binder . o O ( Mmmm, staples. )
Crag heh
Binder says, "He's been promoted from a Crag to a Bald Mountain."
Crag says, "I'll check out some games as a reward for doing my weekly review and work catchup"
Crag heh
stormagnet . o O ( mmmm.... rewards )
stormagnet . o O ( ....I still have cake at home )
stormagnet . o O ( ... )
stormagnet salivates
Binder says, "Cool."
Binder says, "There's another time management concept out there [the name of which escapes me] which has a concept called the UnSchedule."
Binder says, "The idea of it is that you specifically and deliberately block out time to Fuck Around & Do Nothing Much."
Crag says, "That sounds like Slack-Fu to me"
Binder says, "It's for overcommiters such as Cerebus and, to a lesser extent, me."
Crag says, "Totally"
Binder is not yet using it but may.
Binder says, "Because I have all these games I am not playing enough of."
Binder says, "They won't just play themselves!"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "You must invest in yourself first, not just in money but also in time"
Binder says, "Oh, that reminds me."
Binder says, "Vy has video game recommendations for you both, now that you have a ps/2."
Crag says, "oh noes!"
Binder says, "She says Crag will like Burnout 3 [which we call the car-crashing game] and both of you will like We Love Katamari."
Binder says, "I thought it likely you'd have seen both by now but if you haven't, now you must."
Crag says, "I think the katamari games are already on the queue"
Crag says, "I'll add burnout 3"
Binder says, "Goal of burnout 3 is to cause spectacular car crashes."
Crag says, "Heh"
Binder says, "You are rewarded in the solo-play mode for how many $ of vehicle damage you cause, to yourself and others."
Binder says, "In the races, you're incited to run other people off the road."
Crag says, "I can sorta see the appeal of that"
Binder says, "Good times."
Binder says, "There are also some straight-up beat-the-lock races but zzz."
Crag says, "One of the best things about the Need for Speed series was the crashes."
Binder s/lock/clock/
Crag nods.
Crag says, "It's hard to cram a compelling serious driving game into a console"
Binder now has various B3 songs stuck in his head.
Crag says, "The controllers, the TV quality, meh"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "But silly works great on consoles"
Binder says, "For full adrenalin it'd almost have to be a cockpit pod with multiscreen HD and controls more like an actual car."
Binder says, "Force feedback pedals, wheel, pine tree freshener."
Crag says, "I actually prefer a full-size joystick for driving sims"
Crag says, "Because the force-feedback can double as spatial queues"
Crag says, "That's a lot harder to do with the one-dimensional steering wheel"
Crag says, "Like in NFS the joystick's forward resistance indicates traction"
Crag says, "And likewise with breaking"
Binder . o O ( Try a FOUR DIMENSIONAL steering wheel! )
Crag heh
Crag says, "Hyper torroid (and how)"
Binder says, "Wormhole Crash 3."
Binder says, "Just start there, never release or reference a WC1 or 2."
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "I think my next versioned project will have imaginary version numbers"
Crag says, "Expressed in polar coordinates"
Crag says, "Version: |0.35| / 32 degrees"
Crag says, "or something"
Binder says, "Sweet."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Or maybe I could use quaternarians or whatever those hyper imaginaries are called"
Crag says, "anyway"
Binder . o O ( dot com )
Binder shakes his fist at jboss.
Crag says, "I used to think that some day Java and everything associated would redeem themselves in some way and that I would come to appreciate blah blah, but NO!  IT'S STILL STUPID CRAP AND I HATE IT"
Crag says, "Java is almost the MS-Windows of programming languages"
Crag says, "Also, I still don't like the PS/2 in general"
Crag says, "The controller is my least favorite of the three platforms (GC being best, of course)"
Crag says, "And the ramdac or something about the video generation is grainy and invariably ugly"
Crag says, "The same games on all three platforms will always look worst on the PS/2"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I didn't think I'd say it, but the GC is the winner in this generation"
Crag says, "Best controller, most reliable, graphics always _good enough_"
Binder says, "You chose wisely out of the gate on that one."
Crag says, "I don't know that I deserve credit"
Crag says, "I just wanted to please Raine :)"
Crag says, "Her reaction to Animal Crossing was worth $150"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Wow, my email signature was just INCREDIBLY appropriate"

Hi Aaron,

I'd like to talk with you in person about my relationship to the
project.  I prefer to talk with you specifically and privately in order
to keep the conversation practical and on-track.  I am free all day
tomorrow.  Are you available?  I can meet you wherever you prefer.

Robert

Done @pasting.
Crag [to Binder]: Aaron is the saner of the two people leading a project exemplifying the fools and fanatics with so much certainty.
Crag says, "And my intent in meeting him is to tell him I want nothing to do with the project because I have so many doubts. :)"
Crag . o O ( saner?  Less detached from reality?  whatever )
Crag says, "Aaron is the fool and his partner is the fanatic."
Binder says, "That's awesome."
Crag says, "OH yeah!"
Crag says, "The final matchup is that my relationship to the project was one of a rogue sysadmin :)"
Binder ponders spending money.
Binder says, "I know what the problem is."
Binder says, "I have too much money."
Binder says, "So now I keep thinking of things I could spend it on when there's nothing I need to spend it on."
Binder says, "This problem will endure until I find places to invest the money to avoid spending it on silly shit."

stormagnet bought pizza >_<
stormagnet says, "When I asked if they had a salad without, um, MEAT in it, I was told that I could always pick it out"
stormagnet growls
stormagnet TRIES to eat healthy, she SWEARS
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm having the leftover from Tuesday's frozen pizza
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "Clearly, it was fate"
Crag says, "I wonder if Binder will have pizza"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "WHAT ARE THE ODDS!?"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I need to figure out just how long I can safely leave certain foods in an unrefriegerated environment"
stormagnet says, "Like veggies"
stormagnet says, "GODDAMMIT"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Chris Launey at work is an expert on that stuff

Robot receptionists to debut
Thu Jan 26, 2006 11:39 AM ET

TOKYO (Reuters) - Need temporary help on your company's reception desk? One Japanese employment agency is suggesting you try recruiting a robot.

For just under 50,000 yen ($430) a month, a fraction of the cost of a human temp, the PeopleStaff agency will dispatch Hello Kitty Robo, a robotic receptionist capable of sensing a visitor's presence, greeting him or her and holding simple conversations.

The Nagoya-based agency is also offering the services of Ifbot, an elderly-care robot that chats and poses riddles and arithmetical problems to train the brain and help avoid dementia. Spaceman-like Ifbot, which also quizzes people about their health, is aimed at hospitals and old peoples' homes.

A spokeswoman for PeopleStaff said it would cost more than 300,000 yen a month to employ a person for this type of work, but warned that the robots were not capable of doing everything human employees can do.

------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
stormagnet says, "There"
Binder says, "Hello ... Kitty ... Robot?  That sounds like a spoof article to me."
stormagnet says, "Reuters"
Binder says, "Well, there you go!  Obviously parody."
Binder . o O ( Stupid Reuters. )
stormagnet laughs
Binder.  Must.  Not.  Spend.  Money.
Binder has a book recommended to him by his boss, goes to look it up on Powell's, goes @@, immediately wishlists it for Vy and then MUST.  CLOSE.  BROWSER.
Binder says, "Being responsible sucks."
Crag [to stormagnet]: the culture is imminent
Crag says, "I should probably have capitalized 'Culture'"
Crag says, "And possibly 'The'"
Crag says, "and 'Rots'"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I love how you seem to dominate Science>
Crag says, "But I'm biased"
Crag [to stormagnet]: If I Ruled The World> you'd be the room aide/owner of Science> :)
Binder whistles.
Crag says, "I think I'm going to move buying Godel Escher Bach from Someday/Maybe to Next Action"
Crag says, "It's just too related to EVERYTHING I'm doing right now."
Crag does so
Crag [to stormagnet]: I may spend a lot of money at Amazon or Barnes and Noble this weekend.
Crag says, "before or after band practice even... hm"
stormagnet [to Crag]: DO IIIIIT
stormagnet [to Crag]: We NEED that book
stormagnet [to Binder]: I'm not too good at that whole 'responsibility' thing, sometimes
Binder [to stormagnet]: Yeah, you're an excellent bad influence, though.
Binder [to stormagnet]: If money is going to be squandered, doing so on clever books is very nearly ideal.
Binder continues to keep his wallet in his pocket.
Crag says, "stormagnet is without question the best worst influence"
Crag says, "What's the difference between efficiency and effectiveness?"
Crag says, "Is there a real difference?"
Crag says, "Is effectiveness even a word?"
Binder says, "In reverse order:  yes, yes, and effectiveness is suitability for purpose/attaining goal and efficiency is lack of loss via transform."
Crag says, "AH!"
Crag says, "Excellent explination"
Binder says, "So the efficiency in using A/C current to cook lamb in a bath tub of water supersaturated with salt is very high but the effectiveness of that choice, somewhat lacking."
Crag says, "and an even better example"
Crag says, "I mean, that was a better example than I had in mind"
Binder says, "The effectiveness of cooking lamb over a fire is quite high but the efficiency is [relatively] low."
Binder likes examples involving cooking lamb.  Personal preference.
Crag laughs
Binder . o O ( Also, I hate lamb! )
Crag says, "I'm using these words in my Personal Development Plan for 2006 and wanted to make sure I wasn't abusing them."
Binder says, "You could use the Humpty-Dumpty Defense."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "It means exactly what I intend it to mean, no more, no less"
Crag says, "I say what I mean and I mean what I say and that's logic."
Binder says, "You've got it."
Crag says, "My dad's dad was a big fan of that defense."
Crag says, "And it REALLY applied to him because he was... quite insane. :)"
Binder says, "Madness makes the heart grow fonder."
Crag says, "That's probably true"
Crag says, "In my PDP what I actually wanted was both words"
Crag says, "I want to improve my efficiency AND effectiveness"
Crag says, "I want to waste less and get closer to my targets"
Binder says, "Yup."
Binder would settle for increasing personal effectiveness.
Binder says, "Efficiency comes through practice, for me."
Crag says, "that makes sense"
Crag says, "system adaption"
Crag says, "It's the XP way, too"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "Make it work, then make it good :)"
Crag says, "It's nice that XP has such wide applications"
Crag says, "I find that the user<->team interface described by XP is a great model for all relationships"
Crag says, "negotiating stories, making specific short-term commitments, etc"
Crag says, "Seems to tie in nicely with GTD, too"
Binder says, "That's possibly due to XP being a distillation of observed best practices in software dev which are probably specialized versions of general social axioms."
Crag says, "that makes sense"
Binder says, "So as models go, it's pretty functional, so long as the domain is similar."
Binder says, "But it could be a mistake to apply XP in some situations which map less well."
Crag says, "sure"
Crag says, "It's like any model that way"
Binder says, "So we've been pair programming... [in bed!]"
Crag says, "And?"
Crag says, "How is it?"
Binder says, "I've written some unit tests... [for the cat.]"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "You're just being silly"
Binder says, "Me?"
Binder says, "Silly?"
Binder looks around.
Crag says, "like putty"
Binder bounces!
Crag says, "Or PuTTy"
Binder crashes.
Crag laughs
Crag says, "PuTTy is rock-solid"
Binder says, "Actually, it was TeraTerm which bluescreed on me two weeks ago."
Crag says, "I've never seen a bug in PuTTy"
Binder says, "Hmmm, I rather like that typo more than the word I meant."
Crag says, "I know they exist because they're published, but they don't affect me."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "bluescreed"
Binder says, "Yeah, my PuTTy bugs are silly termcap stuff."
Crag says, "ah, those don't count :)"
Binder says, "Bluescreed, a rant triggered by experiencing a normal Windows state of unasked for system halt."
Crag says, "that sounds about right"
Binder says, "And if not right, nominally clever."
Binder will settle for being clever if being right is not an option.
Crag says, "YAY, done with work"
Crag says, "Now GTD review and then play time"
Binder says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "I need to remember to apply XP to my homework strategy"
stormagnet says, "I.e. put DOWN the FUCKING DICTIONARY, and stop trying to be clever"
stormagnet smacks self
Crag grins.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I totally forgot I'm meeting Dan in Fremont at 5:30 today
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
Crag [to stormagnet]: So still call me when you're done, and I may just be in Fremont instead of Shoreline depending on when you call.
stormagnet says, "That sounds MUCH better than Kaiwa Table, actually..."
Crag says, "Or if you're done before then I can bring you along or whatever"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet ,- BAD
Crag laughs
stormagnet . o O ( that comma... that too is BAD )
Binder watches Yet Another p4 Sync.
Crag [to Binder]: I've been using p4 at work and so far I'm not even slightly impressed
Crag says, "It's too heavy"
Crag says, "I'm sure I'm not the target audience, of course"
Crag says, "But even so"
Binder says, "Why I'm using p4:  it's what they were running when I got here and I can't yet make a compelling case to go to something else."
Binder says, "Largely because everything else also sucks."
Binder says, "Bearing in mind:  many developers here use Windows to develop on, zho."
Crag says, "Subversion works great with windows"
Crag says, "TurtleSVN is a decent client for people who need a GUI on windows"
Binder will keep that in mind.
Binder says, "Yeah, I'm familiar with TortoiseCVS."
Binder says, "TurtleSVN related?"
Crag says, "Er, yeah"
Crag says, "I meant Tortoise"
Binder shoots Crag under the table.
Crag laughs
Crag says, "And to think I was worried about being Drunk under the table"
Crag says, "little did I know"
Binder says, "No, that's something else."
Binder . o O ( ... )
Binder sings, "We drink and we die and continue to drink!  We have no heads!  No, we have no heaaaaads!"
Crag says, "Is that a They Might Be Giants song?"
Binder says, "Denis Leary, but close enough."
Binder says, "It's his rendition of an Irish drinking song."
Binder blinks at http://www.learyfirefighters.org/index.html
Binder says, "I got to wondering what Denis Leary had been up to lately."
Binder says, "Evidently he's become a philanthropist concerned about fire departments."
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "Someone. Must, Make. Him. STOP."
stormagnet headdesks emphatically
stormagnet says, "He's trying to snap my MIND"
Crag [to stormagnet]: a worthy goal, some might say
stormagnet says, "NO FREUD"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I DECLARE THIS A FREUD-FREE CLASSROOM"
Crag says, "Sometimes a piece of chalk is just a piece of chalk"
stormagnet says, "PROFESSORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT PENISES"
Crag LAUGHS
Crag says, "Unless it's an anatomy class.."
stormagnet says, "ESPECIALLY not with a funny accent!!"
Crag says, "nice"
Crag says, "My current BioEconomicModel notes are at"
Crag | http://twiki.thatsnice.org/bin/view/Thatsnice/TheOriginalBEMNotes
Crag says, "To be re-factored elsewhere into the wiki, but... not right now."
stormagnet will look later
Crag says, "naturally"
Crag [to Binder]: you too
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "I should probably move all the BEM stuff to its own wikiweb"
Crag says, "so I don't have to put 'bem' in all the nodenames"
Crag says, "I'll do that now"
Crag says, "So ignore that URL I just pasted :)"
Crag says, "Ok, now it's"
Crag | http://twiki.thatsnice.org/bin/view/BEM/OriginalNotes
stormagnet says, "Aaaaand now he's singing the background music"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to need to drink tonight"
Crag ..
stormagnet says, "A LOT"
Crag says, "That can be arranged. :)"
Crag says, "We're meeting Dan at a bar, so... yeah"
stormagnet is somewhat reassured
stormagnet nods
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "He's got Ty Syndrome"
stormagnet says, "Either stunningly obvious and/or redundant, or off the depp end entirely"
stormagnet . o O ( The Depp End? )
stormagnet . o O ( Sounds like something you'd find at Lover's Package )
stormagnet says, "Oh!"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Are you at home right now?
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Could you bring a couple of my textbooks with you?
Crag says, "Of course"
stormagnet cheers!!
Crag says, "Does it matter which ones I bring? :)"
stormagnet laughs 
stormagnet [to Crag]: Yes- I need my film textbook and my Japanese workbook

Binder says, "He's certainly inspired by something."
Crag says, "I mean, if there were a god, and he/she/it talked to humans..."
Crag says, "If _I_ were god, I'd talk to larry"
Crag says, "At the very least he's an excellent linguist who puts his skills to humorous use"
Binder says, "Yes.  He uses his inclinations for mass good."
Crag says, "And I bet God likes a good pun as much as anyone"
Crag says, "That too"
Binder tries to imagine a proprietary Perl.
Binder says, "VisualP++."
Crag says, "It's probably easier to imagine a klein bottle"
Crag heh
Crag says, "visual pee"
Crag says, "Only if MS got their hands on Perl..."
Crag says, "it'd be all hdcThis and pThat"
Crag says, "I hate hate hate hungarian notation"
Binder says, "Rightly so."
Crag says, "I don't go around calling people "friend Shannon" and "wife Raine""
Binder says, "Though it'd be funny if you did and sad if doing so were mandatory."
Crag laughs!
Binder . o O ( Friend Computer... )
Crag says, "Actually"
Crag says, "As I'm thinking about that"
Binder sips some green tea and tastes butter.  What The?!
Crag says, "The sentance "Have you met my friend Nicole?" could be seen as $shannon->doYouKnow(Me::Friend::Nicole) or something"
Crag says, "Or"
Crag says, "going the type/class route and using C"
Crag says, "(friend *) Nicole"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "stupid C"
Crag [to Binder]: Once I have a 0.0 version of the cell/platform protocol I'm going to re-implement my proof of concept in C
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I'm going to use the networking and select loop from the ColdMUD code"
Binder says, "Good code reuse."
Crag nodsnods
Binder ponders English to code.
Binder consolidates: friend shannon.doesKnow?(Nicole) under the presumption that it will return a boolean and take a person.
Binder says, "And that friend is a child of person."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Yes..."
Crag says, "I'd like to spend a lot more time thinking about comutational and social linguistics"
Crag says, "and linguini"
Crag says, "no, that's not right"
Binder says, "No, it is right!"
Binder says, "Let's think about pasta."
Binder says, "Om manicoti primavera hum."
Crag says, "alfredo sauce..."
Crag says, "saucy!"
Binder says, "We could learn a lot from food."
Crag says, "And vice-versa"
Binder will teach his lunch 100 words.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Clearly we've been touched by His Noodly Appendage"
Binder has him as the desktop wallpaper.
Binder says, "Well, laptop wallpaper."
Crag says, "good show"
Crag says, "Is it that image that was posted on Junk?  With the cows in the background?  I like that one."
Binder says, "The very same."
Crag hee hee
Binder says, "The OS X game developer at work who I shall term Bad Apple for the purpose of this story noticed it."
Binder says, "Because he came into the office where my boss and I work."
Crag says, "And in other news, Raine and I watched The Magnificent Seven, and it wasn't."
Binder says, "And he stared and stared."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "And I said, It's the Flying Spaghetti Monster."
Binder says, "And my boss said:  I didn't know you were a religious man!"
Crag says, "completely straight-faced, I'm sure"
Binder says, "And Bad Apple didn't get that reference, either."
Crag says, "oh wow"
Crag says, "I want to hug your boss"
Binder says, "So:  my boss 1, Bad Apple 0."
Binder says, "Bad Apple is not a bad guy, he just keeps bugging me when I'm trying to work."
Binder ponders The Magnificent Sevent.
Binder says, "Yeah, I only enjoyed that movie as much as I did [which was about a 6 out of 10] because I hadn't yet, at the time, seen Seven Samurai."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "I put it on the queue because Raine watched 7S for movie class"
Binder has the Criterion 7S.
Crag says, "And I thought we might as well get M7 over with while 7S was fresh in our minds"
Crag says, "oooo,"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "We want everything Criterion has ever done"
Crag says, "But especially 7S"
Binder nodnodnodnodnodnodnods.
Crag says, "Criterion means Quality"
Binder says, "It's the only Criterion I have because my laziness overwhelms my greed."
Binder says, "If I started buying Criterion, I couldn't stop."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "So I won't let myself start."
Crag says, "My friend Christian has that problem"
Crag says, "he has dozens of Criterion DVDs"
Crag says, "The only Criterion I have is the beastie boys DVD they put out"
Crag says, "Which is, of course, fantastic"
Crag says, "It is the most usefully interactive DVD I've ever experienced."
Binder nod.
Crag says, "I love how often perl man pages make me laugh"
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now
       the preferred delimiter, in part because it's more readable to humans,
       and in part because it's more readable to emacs macros.  It also makes
       C++ programmers feel like they know what's going on--as opposed to
       using the single quote as separator, which was there to make Ada pro-
       grammers feel like they knew what was going on.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Crag says, "from man permod, of course"
Binder nods.
Binder recognizes that quote, having laughed at it, himself.
Crag grins.
Binder pats C++ programmers on the head.
Crag says, "My australian friend Colin with whom I worked on ColdMUD stuff preferred C++ for libraries, but I think it's because he's stubborn"
Crag says, "He put a lot of work into creating a consistent template interface..."
Crag says, "But I don't think it was worth it"
Crag says, "I think we could have come up with something simpler based on C idioms"
Crag says, "My recently renewed interest in Perl is due in part to a co-worker who is taking a Perl class through the UW extension.  It appears to be a really good class from what he's shown me."
Binder says, "Probably so."
Crag says, "So in answering his questions I keep remembering how much fun Perl is"
Binder nods
Crag says, "I'm seeing too that teaching is definitely good for me"
Crag says, "And if I'm too chatty it's probably because I bumped my dose up to 40mg"
Binder says, "If I'm too terse, it's because the caffeine hasn't yet kicked in."
Binder says, "And it's been 50 hours since I had any."
Crag says, "Holy crap, that's terrible"
Crag says, "Why the dry spell?"
Binder forgot to make coffee.
Crag says, "For two days?"
Binder says, "And at work, I forgot to drink any."
Binder nods.
Binder has been OBSESSED by work stuff.
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "Well that's understandable I suppose"
Binder says, "But vis-a-vis the joy of teaching, Vy has found that teaching writing [which she's doing as part of a mentor program] has helped her clarify her thinking and practices of writing."
Binder says, "Sometimes it's easiest to learn new levels of something by teaching other people what you already know."
Crag says, "I didn't know Vy was teaching, that's excellent."
Crag says, "yeah, that's been my experience too"
Crag says, "I think in circles by myself, but when I explain something to someone else one of us sees a new way to think about it"
Crag says, "It's kinda like the difference between riding a stationary bicycle and a regular bike"
Crag says, "At least in how it feels to me"
Binder says, "That makes sense.  Interaction."
Binder says, "Yeah, there's a program she's involved with [through Broad Universe, maybe?] which matches published writers with girls who want to be published writers."
Binder says, "Basically they discuss writing via email, the mentor can assign writing exercises or critique what the mentee has written and help the mentee improve their writing and be realistic about the consequences of choosing to be a writer."
Crag says, "That sounds good"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I'd like to do both versions of that with programming"
Crag says, "mentor/mentee"
Crag says, "I'm already mentoring at work"
Crag says, "But I'd like to abstract it out to email"
Crag says, "That seems like a good way to economize and focus"
Binder says, "Vy likes it.  It helps her articulate some things about her own writing through the process of explaining to the mentee, she feels good for helping other people, and they get a ton of free targeted useful advice."
Binder says, "It's more directly useful than, say, a book on writing."
Crag says, "Exactly"
Binder says, "If you did it with coding, you could ask specifically things like: why doesn't this work? and how could this be smarter?"
Crag says, "And I bet it's not as dependent on the abilities of either party as a book or class might be"
Crag says, "Totally"
Crag says, "Or why would I want to ..."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Programming Best Practices Dialogue."
Binder takes a 15 minute break.
Binder idles: Ladder Climbing
Crag says, "And with the low overhead of email a mentee could have multiple mentors for comparison and such"
Crag nods
Crag catches up on Semantic Web and Perl6 RSS feeds
Crag says, "I think large datacenters should use DHCP or some other centralized/distributed IP assignment mechanism"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "If they must have statics, use the dhcp bind-to-MAC facility."
Crag says, "Exactly"
Crag says, "But I would make that very much the exception, and would favor very short lease times"
Crag says, "The motivation being that it's more important that the system be adaptable than it be stable"
Crag says, "It should do the right thing by default"
Crag says, "So if it can't tolerate an IP change in the environment, that's the problem, not the IP change itself"
Crag says, "As Covey and others keep saying, if you think the problem is outside yourself, that thought is the problem."
Binder says, "Hmm."
Crag says, "I'm sending the suggesiton to Allison just to get the idea out there in people's minds"
Crag says, "I know DIG couldn't make a change like that in under 3 years"
Binder says, "If your server changes IP address and you'll still need to communicate with it, you'll need some way to find it again.  Either dhcp-dns or the server registers somewhere on assignment of new IP or you use multicast to find it again."
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "DHCP-dns was my first inclination"
Binder says, "But static assignment is a barrier to scalability, you're right."
Crag says, "registering somewhere is a superset of DHCP-dns"
Crag says, "And multicast... I dunno"
Crag says, "multicast seems kinda like black magic to me"
Crag says, "Maybe because I don't know what tools I would use to debug it"
Crag says, "Ethereal?  ngrep?"
Crag says, "some clever perl tool I don't know about yet? :)"
Crag says, "But I DO like the idea of the servers and services running somewhat autonomously"
Crag says, "It ties in nicely with my cell/platform project"
Crag says, "It's more coarsely grained, but for today's purposes, that's appropriate"
Binder nods
Binder says, "Refinement can come later."
Crag says, "yes, it's the XP way"
Crag says, "I need to get deeper into XP"
Crag says, "I wonder if any part of DIG engineering would/could try it."
Crag says, "I assume Java is one of the more XP friendly languages"
Binder says, "If it has classes, it can be refactored easily."
Binder says, "If it has reflection, it can have unit test frameworks."
Crag says, "great"
Binder says, "So yeah.  Java even has one of the canonical unit testing frameworks, junit."
Crag says, "That's what I thought"
Crag says, "So DIG is poised for it :P"
Binder says, "Lots of other people are doing XP with Java so there's lots of people you can steal ideas from who've done it and are still doing it."
Crag says, "Maybe it's time I give up my thing about not programming for money"
Binder says, "Argh, headache getting worse."
Crag sings, "I'm your private coder, coder for money, code what you want me to code..."
Binder says, "Codestitution."
Crag [to Binder]: Think happy thoughts!  Gymnast bed!  Stripper wall paper!
Binder . o O ( WOO. )
Binder seeks the ibuprofin he remembers having concealed somewhere on this Earth.
Crag grins.
Binder finds it in his bag, much closer than some alternatives.
Binder says, "Coding for money was a lot more fun at the UW than any other place I've done that as part of my role."
Binder says, "Probably because they were willing to let me pursue intellectual purity in my code."
Crag says, "not surprising from an intellectual institution"
Crag says, "But yeah, that would make a big difference"
Crag says, "DIG would almost certainly never give their teams that much leash."
Crag says, "I wonder what DHCP servers and clients do when a rogue machine insists that IT has an IP, and all of you are wrong, dammit!"
Crag says, "I wonder if the client and server would just re-negotiate"
Crag says, "I wonder if google will tell me"
Crag . o O ( I also wonder )
Binder . o O ( Oh well! )
Crag [to Binder]: we watched the Skeleton again a little over a year ago.  Still funny, possibly funnier.
Binder was off in another window admiring chaosium.com's shopping cart dressing.
Crag peers
Binder says, "Yes, we own it and watch it every couple months and find it getting funnier."
Binder says, ""
Binder says, "Cultists who bought this product also purchased"
Crag says, "It is one of the thousands of items we would like to buy Someday/Maybe"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Apparently 'Tentacles is coming'"
Binder says, "WOO."
Crag says, "That seems ... wrong."
Binder says, "You've just prejudiced against hentai."
Binder says, "You've?  You're!"
Crag laughs and laughs at Mythos Football League.
Binder . o O ( me talk good?  no, talk bad do )
Crag says, "Me fail english?  That's unpossible."
Binder says, "The Chaosium people are wicked funny."
Crag says, "Clearly!"
Binder is fighting the urge to buy something from them.
Binder eyes The King in Tatters.
Crag says, "And on a total tangent, now that I'm almost done with Gun on the GC (having just finished it on PS/2 a few days ago), I still agree with myself that the GC version is vastly superior to the PS/2 version in controls, performance and rendering, but the game is still too short."
Crag says, "But otherwise I really like it and I'm thinking I might keep it."
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I may already have gotten $20 worth of fun out of it"
Binder will probably not play it while Vy is in the house.
Binder says, "She is sensitized to violence."
Crag says, "I'm also planning to write to Neversoft to pat them on the head and give them feedback and encouragement and stuff"
Crag [to Binder]: good plan
Crag says, "It's... icky"
Binder says, "Do you remember Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem?"
Crag says, "YES!"
Crag says, "I want more!"
Binder says, "We couldn't get through the opening CREDITS before we had to stop."
Crag says, "Er wait"
Binder says, "It upset her."
Crag says, "Is that the original Eternal Darkness game?"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Poor Vy"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "But there are lots of good games for her."
Crag says, "I can understand a little though"
Crag says, "totally"
Binder says, "We have Puyo Pop Fever for GC out from Gamefly now."
Binder says, "She likes it."
Crag says, "What surprises me is that Raine is disgusted at Gun but loves Eternal Darkness"
Crag says, "Something to do with a difference in attitude"
Crag says, "What is Puyo Pop Fever?"
Crag peers at eternaldarkness.com
Crag says, "No mention of a sequel, though"
Binder says, "PPF is a bit like Tetris 2-player.  Objects drop from above, get rotated, drop into position, if you succeed in clearing objects, it penalizes your opponent."
Binder says, "The objects are squishy jiggly gelatinous blogs."
Binder says, "The clearing method is to bring four or more of them together, touching, and there's a bonus for doing that through cascading."
Binder says, "So the gameplay is not new or innovative, but it is goofy anime style art and the sound effects are cute."
Binder says, "There's some pretense of a storyline but it's stupid, it's just more excuses to throw down with the other named characters."
Crag says, "Sounds like it good be amusing"
Crag says, "I'll add it to the queue :)"
Crag says, "Raine is unsurprisingly attached to Nintendogs"
Crag says, "A few days ago she... called me from school ... to ask me to feed her dog."
Crag says, "I refused"
Crag says, "but she's definitely getting value out of her DS"
Crag says, "I've barely touched mine"
Crag says, "She insisted that we both get them so we could play networkable games together remotely"
Crag says, "Which made sense at the time"
Crag says, "But in practice there hasn't been time"
Binder nods.
Binder has been eyeing a PSP.
Binder says, "I like the hackable potential there."
Binder says, "But then Sony made my List and so I haven't given them anymore money."
Binder says, "Laws compulsively plays her DS."
Crag says, "Penny Arcade's been down on the PSP"
Crag says, "They were disappointed"
Binder says, "See, that is just another recommendation to me."
Binder . o O ( fkn pennyarcade )
Crag says, "heh"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "I know this is beyond laughable, but I think DIG needs a MUD"
Crag says, "And since I'm asking for ponies, it should be integrated with other tools"
Crag says, "meh"
Binder says, "Well, pass it off as a multi-user interactive conversation space, to supplement IM and email, but with the added ability to model objects for conversation."
Binder says, "MOO would seem well suited to an engineering department."
Binder says, "Having trouble explaining your project plan?  @create a mockup set of objects with verbs and conduct show and tell."
Crag says, "yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking"
Crag says, "If it had a GUI it could be buzzword compliant and get VC"
Binder says, "And it'd be called World of Warcraft."
Crag says, "Oooo, an AJAX gui. heh"
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Hey, get everyone playing Second Life.  :)"
Crag says, "heh"
Binder says, "Then once they get the idea, bring it in house for reasons of biz confidentiality."
Crag says, "Maybe we could turn the toontown engine into a work tool"
Crag says, "Only with different 3d models, obviously"
Crag says, "You and I should run a tech service company"
Crag says, "We would kick so much ass"
Binder says, "Hey, that's right, you've got an inhouse MMORPG."
Binder says, "Why am I not hearing about that online?"
Binder says, "Are you out of beta with that?"
Crag says, "Toontown has been profitable for over a year"
Crag says, "Pirates beta starts Real Soon Now"
Binder says, "So have them set up a private server inhouse for people to congregate in."
Crag says, "The MMORPG group (VR Studios) is scaling up their production systems by a factor of 3 this year, and probably for the forseeable future"
Crag says, "yeah, I think I might mention that"
Crag says, "Might be a good place to test code too"
Crag says, "depending on their testing models"
Binder says, "Sharp thinking."
Crag says, "I've got an interview with them next time they're in Seattle, which should be in a few weeks"
Binder says, "Yeah, you said a thing about that before."
Crag says, "So I'll wait until I get the results of that before I make any rash suggestions"
Crag says, "Bleah, it's busy at work today"
Crag says, "I was already going to be staying late, but if I hadn't been planning to I would be"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "that came out funny"
Binder crosses his eyes.

Binder | Monday, January 30th 2006 09:34:30, from Dr Qwe
Binder |
Binder | Any Linux Sys Admin people looking for work in Seattle? The games team at Real is hiring for one to replace a completely incompetent boob, so it'd be pretty easy to look good coming into this position. I can put a resume on the hiring managers desk, so let me know if you are interested.
Binder |
Binder |  [72 Cubemonkeys EAT AT THEIR DESKS] msg #8,355 (0 remaining) #
Binder says, "Probably not as easy as staying on at WDIG, but might mean more $.  Real seems to be quite profitable."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "How does Real compare to Disney on the Evil scale?"
Binder says, "More ambition to do harm with fewer resources."
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "tempting"
Binder says, "My basic take on it is, you have a network to Dr Qwe, it's a local gig, and nothing bad can happen from shopping your resume around."
Binder says, "Worst case scenario is that they offer you a job which sucks in some way and you say thanks-but-no-thanks and stay with WDIG."
Binder says, "And that's the WORST."
Binder says, "Various other scenarios are better."
Binder says, "Like, no offer but you get a chance to dust off your interviewing skills."
Binder says, "Or, no interview but you refresh your resume and get it current."
Binder says, "Or, great offer which pays more / has more interesting work."
Crag says, "Yeah, you're right"
Crag says, "I'll send Dr. Qwe my resume's url"
Binder says, "w00."
Binder says, "I am a big believer in checking out the job market every 6-12 months even if you're ECSTATIC where you are, to keep an eye on where things are headed, what people are looking for, what technologies are now passe, what's hot, and to keep your interviewing skills sharp and your resume current."
Binder is reminded to set an explicit tickle reminder in his remind-files.
Crag says, "Yeah, that's a sound practice."
Crag says, "Likewise with lovers :)"
Binder says, "Heh."
Binder says, "Vy often deploys the metaphor that looking for a job is a lot like the dating scene."
Binder says, "One night stands parallel reading want ads / job boards.  It may pay the bills but it may drive you crazy or make you sick."
Binder says, "The longest lasting relationships tend to come from friend-networks, which parallels knowing someone at a company who recommends you."
Crag says, "I have a theory that all relationships between autonomous entities can be bioled down in some useful way"
Crag says, "I apply the same principles to all my relationships: work, romance, business, friend, family, etc"
Binder says, "My problem in SF so far as that by the time I look for a job I am sick of what I'm doing and feel like I have to take the first halfway good offer to escape it.  I'd like to be in the position I was in years ago, looking at jobs when I was happy with what I was doing.  Gave me a lot more leverage on negotiating."
Crag says, "Totally"
Binder . o O ( Which is why Crag exchanged rings with his boss... )
Crag heh
Binder is not convinced that all relationships are isomorphic.
Binder says, "But I will concede that some metaphors are applicable in more than one context."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "My claim is a gross over-generalization and is vulnerable to the standard attacks on such generalizations."
Crag says, "However, my cell/platform project is informed by my ideas about the shared properties of relationships between autonomous entitites."
Crag says, "entities."
Crag says, "I should look into MOO or TinyFugue based spelling correction or something"
Crag says, "later"
Binder . o O ( Someday/Maybe )
Binder says, "Though entitites would rhyme with out of sight.  Which is a point in their favor."
Crag says, "I wonder if stormagnet will be on the MOO today"
You see no sm here.
Crag [to Binder]: She messed up her ankle snowboarding yesterday
Crag says, "So today she's going to the doctor instead of school"
Binder says, "I also wonder."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'lost skeleton'.
Binder says, "Wow, awesome."
Binder says, "Bad Apple just came by to pester me but this time he gave me a lead on solving the problem I've been wrestling with for a week now."
Crag says, "nice"
Crag says, "Maybe some day you can promote him to mediocre apple"
Crag says, "Or perhaps bad japanese pear-apple"
Binder says, "Bad Pine Apple."
The screen door opens from the other side.
stormagnet arrives from the Forest Clearing.
The screen door slams shut.
stormagnet sits on the lumpy pillow.
Crag [to stormagnet]: any news?
Crag sits on the squishy pillow.
Crag wins!
stormagnet wavies
stormagnet says, "Hee"
stormagnet says, "I feel much better today"
stormagnet says, "And my JapanCiv TA let me email him my paper"
stormagnet just finished it and sent it
stormagnet says, "My doctor's appointment is for 2:50"
stormagnet says, "I'm feeling a LOT better, though"
stormagnet says, "Of course, taping it, iceing it, and feeding it ibuprofin is just what they'll tell me when I get there ANYWAY"
stormagnet says, "I was sort of toying with the idea of taking the bus to my appointment, I feel so much better"
stormagnet says, "Then I remembered what happened the LAST time I had that genius idea"
stormagnet says, "And looked out the window, and saw the slick sidewalks, and thought the better of it"
stormagnet CAN be taught
stormagnet says, "I also talked to Citifinancial, and wrote out our checks"
stormagnet says, "If we drop them in the box tonight, we're okay"
Crag [to stormagnet]: good girl on the not taking the bus thing
Crag says, "and yes, I can swing by CF tonight"
Crag says, "I'm meeting Nicole after work, though, so I probably won't be home before 8"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Okay then :)"
stormagnet says, "Man, my book and a bunch of my notes for writing that paper were in my bag"
stormagnet says, "The one in Zippo's back seat"
stormagnet says, "I want due props for having retained what I read well enough to write a paper on pure memory"
stormagnet says, "INCLUDING dates and names"
Crag gives stormagnet an xp for 'props'.
stormagnet grins
stormagnet [to Crag]: Thank you :)
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm catching up on Prattle> and have just discovered that I can no longer read/hear Shiraz without thinking of The Legionnaire's Lament
Binder returns from Capricorn Coffees with, yes, coffee.
Binder kicks his heels up and rocks out.
Crag [to stormagnet]: Capricorn Coffees, eh?  Coffee that Gets You Higher?
Binder looks at Crag.
Binder looks at stormagnet.
Binder . o O ( What am I, invisible? )
Crag says, "dammit"
Crag [to Binder]: sorry, I've got "`sm" stuck in my fingers
Crag [to Binder]: I meant to address you
Crag says, "I blame Service Desk"
Binder snickers.
Binder will accept that alibit.
Binder says, "Er, alibi."
Crag says, "I thought you might :)"
Crag . o O ( alibits are data which voich for excuses )
Crag says, "vouch"
Binder says, "Their coffee is damned fine and could well conceivably make a person high."
Crag . o O ( voich : to vouch with the voice )
Binder says, "I try never to put anything incriminating in email because smtp is only 7-alibit clean."
stormagnet looks at Binder
Binder looks right back!
Crag heh
Crag [to Apple]: I don't need a "Quicktime" applet/agent/spy/whatever on my machine.  Get your damn hands off my computing resources.  Bastards.
stormagnet idles: yo taxi!
Crag says, "I can't hear the phrase 'drum machine' without thinking of that damned song"
Binder . o O ( I'm a miwwionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht and a dwum machine )
stormagnet says, "GOD FUCKING DAMN IT"
stormagnet stabs the FUCKING TAXI COMPANY
stormagnet says, "I need to see if there's something else in this area more reliable than Yellow/Graytop"
stormagnet says, "This is the SECOND time they've made me miss an appointment"
stormagnet says, "And THIS time, it COULDN'T be rescheduled"
stormagnet says, "Not for TODAY, anyway"
stormagnet stabstabstabbity stabs
stormagnet says, "I CAN'T miss another day"
Binder says, "Those North Seattle Only people are pretty good.  But they only take you to Sea-Tac."
stormagnet says, "I have a MIDTERM, for fuck's sake"
Binder <- not helpful.
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure it's just a sprain, anyway"
stormagnet says, "I'll see if I can make an appointment with the Hall Health nurse tomorrow"
stormagnet says, ":headdesks"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
stormagnet headesks some MORE
stormagnet says, "Now, of course, I've missed a day of school for the purpose of seeing a doctor and will be returning without a NOTE from said doctor"
stormagnet doesn't know WHAT to fucking do
Binder says, "Sue Yellow Cab."
Binder says, "Or show up at the doctor's office, anyway, and have them fit you in."
Binder says, "Doctors will do that."
stormagnet shakes her head
stormagnet says, "I called, and they said that only two doctors were in that day"
stormagnet says, "The other two are on vacation or something, I don't know"
Binder shrugs.
stormagnet says, "But they're booked solid"
Binder has done that, even when they're booked solid.
stormagnet nods
Binder says, "They will see you rather than make you leave at close of biz."
Binder says, "They've got an oath."
stormagnet says, "But I'd be $40 out on cabfare either way"
Binder says, "It says they have to see patients and give you candy if you cry."
stormagnet says, "I'm sort of tempted to just go to the hospital"
stormagnet says, "Which is what the ski patrol told me to do in the forst place"
stormagnet says, "Which would be way more expensive, but WOULD procure me the necessary paperwork for the vschool peeps"
stormagnet sighs
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "If the paperwork matters, you need to get it."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "G"
stormagnet says, "GOD"
stormagnet says, "I fucking hate everything right now"
Binder says, "Have you considered therapeutic homicide?"
stormagnet says, "AT LENGTH"
stormagnet says, "Shit- even if I DO go to the hospital, WHEN?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: You're not getting home until after 8, and still have to drop off paperwork after THAT, yes?
stormagnet says, "So tonight is clearly not much of an option"
stormagnet ponders
stormagnet says, "I didn't miss any exams YET"
stormagnet says, "I'm just gointg to be late on a few assignments"
stormagnet says, "I can probably get away with not having a doctor's note yet"
stormagnet says, "And the paper wasn't actually late, because he let me email it in"
stormagnet says, "So, Hall Health it is"
stormagnet says, "I guess I'll have to look up that Dial-A-Ride thing, to get around campus"
stormagnet says, "I don't know if I'll need a note for that, or if showing up on crutches is generally considered sufficient"
stormagnet sighs
Binder kicks his heels up and rocks out.

Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm sure Nicole would understand if you need me to drive you to the hospital tonight
Crag says, "I get off work at 5:30, and with traffic I'd probably be home by 6:30"
Crag says, "I could go to Citi while you're at the hospital"
Crag says, "Though Hall Health seems like the simpler solution"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Hall Health would be simpler and cheaper
stormagnet [to Crag]: The hospital only makes sense if it turns out I need to have a doctor's note for school
stormagnet [to Crag]: The only problem is that if I DON'T get a note, by the time I find out that I need one it will be too late to get one
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm going to go ahead and use Hall Health
stormagnet [to Crag]: Because I only missed the one day
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet should be ok
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet [to Crag]: Thank you for offering, though
Binder . o O ( Awww )
Crag says, "My next 90 minutes at work are non-monitoring and I will be less idle"
stormagnet blushes
Crag says, "Of course"
stormagnet [to Crag]: School on crutches is going to suck, though
Crag says, "it can't be helped"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Crag]: Shoganai
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet [to Crag]: OH! 
stormagnet [to Crag]: One thing I was going to ask
stormagnet [to Crag]: Could you pick up some Ace bandages on your way home?
Crag says, "Possibly..."
Crag says, "Where would I do that? :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet [to Crag]: Any drugstore, or most grocery stor pharmacies
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet [to Crag]: And some adhesive tape to go with it
Binder says, "What, don't you keep Ace bandages in your desk?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: If the bandages aren't the self-adhesive kind
stormagnet [to Binder]: I so SHOULD
stormagnet [to Binder]: I already own my own pair of crutches
stormagnet [to Binder]: And a foam walking-booty thing
Binder says, "You're totally ready for Japanese cosplay!"
stormagnet BWAHS
Binder says, "Nurses Gone Naughty."
stormagnet says, "Now I just need a blue wig!"
stormagnet laughs
Binder says, "Poifict."
stormagnet [to Binder]: I was thinking to go the Rei route
stormagnet grins
Binder says, "Ohyeah."
stormagnet . o O ( Evas Gone Wild )
Binder says, "Elegant Goth Emergency Care Lolitas."
stormagnet [to Binder]: Year before last, I had a sprained foot for Halloween
stormagnet [to Binder]: Everybody thought it was part of my costume
Binder says, "Heh."
Binder [to stormagnet]: Nice!
Crag [to stormagnet]: We might get a free piano.  I don't know the details yet
stormagnet [to Crag]: AAAAAAiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!
stormagnet shriekpoings!
Crag says, "I didn't get a response yet"
Crag says, "so don't get too excited"
Crag says, "I'm sure I'm not the only one interested."
stormagnet}
stormagnet says, "oops"
stormagnet :}
stormagnet [to Crag]: What kind?
stormagnet [to Crag]: Upright?
Crag says, "don't know"
Crag says, "No details at all"
Crag says, "No response"
Crag says, "All I know is that Chris said Dave Walters is giving away a piano and email him if we want it"
Crag says, "I emailed him immediately, of course"
Crag says, "I'm assuming we'd pay for transport and such"
Crag says, "So it's still several hundred dollars, but still"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And then there's the question of where to put it"
Crag says, "The music room, but is it upright, and if not..."
stormagnet says, "Next to the record player"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "We'll have to see"
stormagnet says, "If it's grand, I have NO idea"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I doubt he'd give away a grand"
Crag says, "Chris said it was in good shape"
Crag says, "So it's got to be an upright of some sort"
Crag says, "But if it is..."
Crag says, "We'll just have to find room."
Crag says, "get a bigger house or something :)"
Crag . o O ( this is how it starts )
Crag says, "Lisa Stidham finally replied to me"
Crag says, "I'm writing her back now, am going to see if she wants to hang out again"
Binder says, "Whee!"
Binder sent her a Yule card.
Crag says, "nice"
Binder really got into the whole constructing stuff with the cards.
Binder says, "My design sensibilities are not the best but I can glue shit together like nobody's business."
Binder . o O ( My hands, my eyelids, the neighbor's cat... )
stormagnet laughs!
Binder eyes his boss's phones as they both ring in succession.
Binder says, "Oh, well, they'll call back."
stormagnet laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: Dan said he totally flaked on Thursday due to some theater thing and forgetting to check his plans
Crag says, "So we're on for this thursday"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet cheers!
Binder . o O ( Theater people. )
stormagnet . o O (  Gone Wild! )
Binder . o O ( Under God. )
Crag . o O [ HOT HOT HOT ]
stormagnet . o O (  In bed )
Binder . O o ( Of France )
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet [to Binder]: I hadn't heard that one
Binder [to stormagnet]: export LOCALE=us.WTF-BayArea
stormagnet SPITTAKES
Crag grins.
stormagnet [to Crag]: On the plus side, I can now say that yesterday was DEFINITELY quite a work out
stormagnet is sore like a sore thing
stormagnet is too damn sore to be writing these flashcards
stormagnet reads some Years of Rice and Salt instead
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "gah, forgot to bring my laptop"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I've had a horrible pain in my neck all day.  I may need to get a massage before Saturday
Crag says, "Maybe Thursday"
Crag idles: meeting with Nicole, picking up bandages, sleeping, whatever
[Idling at 5:19 P.M. on Mon, Jan 30: meeting with Nicole, picking up bandages, sleeping, whatever]
Crag . o O ( but not at the same time )
Crag idles: commute, settle in at work
[Idling at 6:22 A.M. on Tue, Jan 31: commute, settle in at work]
stormagnet says, "That link in Amused> cracked me right up"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Today is my day to get pissed off at people who are field-dependent
Crag says, "Or who think everyone is"
Crag says, "I would THINK that a PROGRAMMER would know how to write docs which are parameterized"
Crag says, "So instead of having a DUPLICATE section for EVERY HOST a service could fail on..."
Crag says, "It would just say INSERT HOSTNAME HERE"
Crag rages
Crag says, "AND!  The startup/shutdown scripts for weblogic on our international servers have a stupid bug which generates disturbing but unimportant error messages"
Crag says, "I'm having that feeling again where I think I've been too optimistic about the intelligence of the rest of the world."
Binder says, "I call that feeling 'morning'."
Crag laughs!
Binder says, "By late evening, the caffeine wears off and the alcohol kicks in and I'm much more forgiving."
Crag [to Binder]: I had been missing your witty banter.  I'm glad you're hanging out on the MOO again.

Total: 3 people, 2 of whom have been active recently.
Crag . o O ( givexp TIME CUBE to misha )
Crag [to stormagnet]: Since this keeps coming up I think you should check it out:
Crag | http://www.timecube.com/
Crag [to Binder]: I was explaining TIME CUBE to Raine and Nicole recently and they had no idea what I was talking about.
Binder says, "They're young."
Binder says, "They don't remember when the internet was the province of the deranged."
Binder says, "My first reaction to the World Wide Web [tm] was:  oh, God, talk.bizarre 0wns jou!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I never really got into usenet"
Crag says, "When I had a local news server at the ISP I did the porn thing, of course"
Crag says, "And I did browse around some of the really silly things like alt.pave.the.earth, or whatever it was"
Crag says, "and alt.weslie.crusher.die.die.die"
Crag says, "and alt.cows.moo.moo.moo"
Crag says, "But I haven't seen talk.bizarre"
Binder says, "talk.bizarre is like timecube + fatmouse + alt.stupid + weebl & bob in text."
Binder says, "I think the only Usenet froup I posted to was alt.sex.bondage.particle.physics."
Binder says, "HOTTT!"
Crag says, "wow"
Binder has a funny story.
Crag says, "I <3 teh interweb!"
Crag [to Binder]: yes! story time!
Binder says, "So, friend of mine in college starts posting to alt.my.head.hurts."
Binder says, "Strikes up a friendship with a, shall we say, lady friend."
Binder says, "Who lives quite close by, only a state away."
Binder says, "So they migrate their conversation off of Usenet into email."
Binder says, "Start talking about how they might meet up."
Binder says, "Turns out she's going to be coming to the town we're in quite soon."
Crag . o O ( scary music starts up )
Binder says, "To visit ... her daughter ..."
Binder says, "Who is .... the guy's current local lady friend ..."
Crag snorts
Binder says, "DUHN DUHNNNNNN."
Crag . o O ( Dear Penthouse, I always thought those mother-daughter stories were fake until... )
Binder says, "But evidently being attractive to him is a genetic trait."
Binder snickers.
Crag says, "that's one theory"
Crag says, "Here's another one: being a slut is a genetic trait"
Crag says, "but then, what do I know"
Crag says, "Maybe they really had some kind of connection or something"
Crag says, "was his current relationship open?"
Crag says, "Oh, another theory: gf's mom was testing him to see if he was loyal or something"
Crag says, "not likely back then, but you never know"
Crag says, "The gf might have put her mom up to it"
Crag says, "or something"
Binder says, "From memory, the genetic sluttery is probably the most plausible scenario."
Binder says, "Since the connection came as a shock to all parties involved."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Dear security.debian.org, WHAT?!"
Binder tries to update and gets warnings about a new public gpg key which is not the gpg key on their site.
Crag says, "I bet that's a hot topic in irc"
Binder nods.
Binder got on #debian about 10 days back.
Binder quickly left again.
Binder says, "Nonstop scrolling bashing Ubuntu on #debian and the converse on #ubuntu."
Binder says, "Craziness."
Binder says, "It wasn't helped by people [trolls?] recurringly showing up in one channel or the other asking for help with something specific to the other version."
Binder guesses trolling based on the frequency and specificity.
Crag blinks
Crag says, "I can't imagine why Debian users would spend any energy on other distros, much less bashing one which is from my point of view helping Debian"
Crag says, "There must be more to it..."
Crag says, "but I don't care enough to look into it, of course"
Crag says, "I am not surprised by the trolling, though"
Binder is not surprised that the people with enough time to sit on #debian would base Ubuntu users.
Crag says, "that's a good point"
Binder reads email.
Crag says, "That general problem has been one of the main things that keeps me out of irc in general"
Binder | One thing that has come to my mind after a while with RT was making
Binder | tickets with newest replies/comments to stand out. In the front page of
Binder | RT in the "x highest priority tickets i own" table all of the tickets
Binder | titles are balded by default. I would like to change that behavior.
Binder | I want that the ticket titles written in plain font, and balded if a
Binder | ticket has received a reply that hasn't been yet read by the owner.
Binder | Anyone have any ideas how to do it?
Binder | /endpast
Binder . O o ( Balded? )
Crag heh
Crag says, "And apparently not a typo"
Crag says, "Maybe it's some kind of joke?"
Binder says, "Maybe he ... really thinks ... that's how you spell that?"
Crag says, "Dan Weatbrook says "incidentses" or "incidentces" or however that's spelled and I don't know if he does it to be funny"
Binder deletes the email in a panicked frenzy of confusion.
Crag laughs
Binder says, "The plural plural of incident?"
Binder says, "Incidences?"
Binder says, "Co-incidences?"
Binder says, "Cohabitincidences?"
Binder says, "The longer I make it, the more Latinate it looks to me."
Crag says, "I don't think 'incidents' needs a plural"
Crag says, "And I'm going to bug Dan about it on Thursday when I see him"
Crag says, "To at least find out if he knows he's being funny"
Binder says, "Dear Dan Weatbrook, WTF, over?"
Crag says, "I think what I'm looking forward to most about my platform/cell project is the possibility of realizing the code reuse dream in the extreme"
Crag says, "The idea that if it takes off I might never have to deal with certain ancient recurring programmer mistakes"
Crag says, "I know there will be new recurring problems, but that doesn't bother me"
Crag says, "There are other aspects I like too, though"
Crag says, "Such as the EXTREME de-coupling of unrelated objects like UI widgets and applications"
Crag says, "So that I can have vi keys in all my textareas"
Crag says, "I also like the idea that software will respond to my anger"
Crag says, "And 'new' ideas like single sign-on will fall out of the system naturally"
Crag says, "and in completely unrelated news, WDPRO has a process which takes up over 1gig of memory under normal conditions"
Crag says, "And if it were the only process on the box that might be OK, but the machine's current 'Commit Charge' is over 6gig and has been as high as 7"
Crag says, "And that's normal across the machines in this 'cluster'"
Crag [to Binder]: You miss DIG a little.  I'm sure you do.
Binder checks himself.
Binder wrecks himself.
Binder says, "What I miss about DIG:  Working odd shifts."
Crag says, "Yeah, I could see going back to a swing shift if I weren't trying to focus on my self-discipline this year"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "If I'm still in the SOC in 2007 I may request a swing shift"
Crag says, "I bet one of the swing guys would trade with me"
Binder says, "Swing is good for working on certain other projects."
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Solo stuff, mostly."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "Not so good for the social stuff."
Binder @@ at his paycheck.
Binder says, "Then I remembered not all of the deductions are happening, yet."
Binder says, "Where'd all this MONEY come from?  Oh, right, it's NOT going into my FSA, NOT going into Blue Cross and NOT going into 401k, yet."
Binder says, "Man."
Binder says, "This is quite an involved combat system I'd rolled out."
Binder says, "Ducking and hit points."
Binder drops a tilebag.
%n shakes the bag of tiles.
Binder hmms.
Binder gets the tilebag.
%n shakes the bag of tiles.
Crag [to Binder]: Combat system?
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag says, "I'm intrigued by your ideas and I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter"
Crag says, "Oh that"
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder says, "Yup."
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder slashes at Crag, but Crag ducks the attack.
Binder says, "Ducking.  Hit points."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I remember now"
Binder says, "Most importantly, stabbing."
Crag laughs
Binder gives you a tilebag.
Binder [to Crag]: Shake it.
Binder puts the PG's dot dot dot Blanket in the quilt chest.
Binder gives stormagnet a pointy hat.
You shake up the bag of tiles.
Crag shakes it, doesn't break it.
Crag heh, dot dot dot

stormagnet wakes
stormagnet says, "Owie"
stormagnet totally failed her test this morning
stormagnet  @_X
stormagnet says, "In my defense, apparantly EVERYONE did crap on it"
stormagnet says, "The groans and curses were myriad"
Binder says, "Yay?"
stormagnet says, "As the professor seemed to have forgotten that she was putting material on the test that WE HADN'T COVERED YET"
stormagnet says, "It was only a little weekly quiz, not a midterm or anything"
stormagnet says, "So, um, sorta-yay"
stormagnet says, "I think our grades will be mitigated by the curve"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "I really need to have something more interesting to talk about than my classes"
stormagnet says, "Seriously"
stormagnet rocks out to Chimbley Sweep
Binder suggests Boobies as an alternative topic.
stormagnet is a poor and a wretched boy
Crag grins.
stormagnet [to Binder]: But then all I can think about is this super-ridiculously-HAWT girl I have classes with
stormagnet says, "My next class, in fact"
Crag . o O ( Rose! )
stormagnet nodnods!
Binder says, "Why is that bad?"
stormagnet [to Binder]: I fear for my brain, and my ability to NOT put my conversational partners into a coma
stormagnet [to Binder]: Mind you, my coma-inducing powers COULD be used for AWESOME
Crag . o O ( Rose! )
stormagnet [to Binder]: But first, I must learn that with great power, comes great responsibility
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet gives Crag a shake
stormagnet [to Crag]: Snap out of it, man!
Crag grins in a most silly way.
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm going to ask her today if she wants to watch that film over at our house
Crag says, "great!"
Crag says, "I'm thinking I'll come up with a reason to stay out of your way after I've met her so as not to accidentally ruin all your plans or something"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet [to Crag]: I don't have plans, not really
stormagnet [to Crag]: I mean, I'm pretty sure she's straight.
stormagnet [to Crag]: AND taken.
Crag says, "SO?!"
Crag grins
stormagnet [to Crag]: AND monogamous.
Crag says, "Anything can change"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag [to stormagnet]: I would have turned gay for you if necessary
stormagnet says, "Awwwwwww!"
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'totally gay'.
Crag laughs!
stormagnet [to Crag]: Would you be my sensitive gay cowboy lover?
Crag says, "I'm not sure what that entails"
stormagnet [to Crag]: I haven't seen the movie yet, nor read the book
stormagnet [to Crag]: But I hear it has something to do with PIE
stormagnet [to Crag]: And PONIES
Crag says, "so far so good..."
Crag says, "WAIT..."
Crag says, "What exactly... does it have to do with ponies?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: NOT THAT
Crag says, "Hopefully not something... gay"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet . o O (  ....I think.. )
Binder is envisioning an adaptation of The Outsiders with Ponygay.
Crag!
Crag says, "I'm not familiar with The Outsiders"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Do you know vwhen this convention thing Martha's been going to is over?
Crag says, "I thought it ended last Friday.  Yesterday came as a total surprise to me"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Because, much as I love her company, it's definitely taken a toll on my studying/homework
stormagnet nods
stormagnet thought so too...
Crag says, "I think maybe it came as a surprise to her as well"
Crag says, "I don't think she'll be back this week"
Crag says, "She surprised Chet too, judging from the car key story"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "It WAS a lot of fun watching Arsenic and Old Lace with her last night"
Crag says, "yes."
Crag says, "She laughs like us :)"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "She totally is going to think we're alcoholics now, though"
stormagnet says, "We were drinking each night she came over"
Crag says, "whatever"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'll just play that Streets song for her"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "It's simple common sense"
Crag says, "Now that I know how impressed she is with you I'm not worried about what she thinks"
stormagnet . o O ( man, I wish this Full Throttle stuff weren't so cheap )
stormagnet . o O (  because it tastes like ASS )
Crag says, "Nothing wakes me up like ass in a can"
stormagnet BWAHs
stormagnet [to Crag]: http://www.uclick.com/client/wpc/td/
Crag [to stormagnet]: And on the Rose thing, you just wait - some day her boyfriend will do something stupid (he's a guy, it's innevitable) and she'll turn to you for comfort and the rest is obvious. :)
Crag checks out the link...
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "THat's pretty funny"
stormagnet says, "SWEET FUCKING CHRIST ON A POGO STICK"
stormagnet says, "We always knew Eyeman was weasel, but"

Crag groans
stormagnet says, "And with that, I'm off to class again"
Binder swears.
Foo.
Binder shakes the nothing.
FOO.
stormagnet just got ROBBED
stormagnet . o O ( must. pack. lunches )
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet says, "Small cup of salad. Small cup of soup. Small cup of fruit. Grilled cheese sandwich. Soda."
stormagnet says, "$13.50"
stormagnet says, "Though I suppose..."
stormagnet says, "Not adding weight to my backpack when I have a sprained ankle: Priceless"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "Once again, if I'd gone for the junk food, it would have been a world cheaper, though >_<"
stormagnet says, "But like I can really afford that, when the gym is verboten for the week"
stormagnet . o O ( Though, if it weren't for the WALK, I might could swim )
stormagnet [to Crag]: BIODIESEL!!

Republicans also worried that the bill's four earmarked projects would get an advantage over private-sector attempts to build facilities.

"We will cut the legs out from under those who are trying to do this in the private sector and do it in a market-driven manner," said Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Carrolls.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - An Australian state plans to ban students from wearing denim because it is linked with having a good time.

"It is associated with weekend wear, with recreational time. It's just unacceptable at schools and we are trying to lift the standards," a spokesman for Western Australia state Education Minister Ljiljanna Ravlich said.

The ban on denim in Western Australia's secondary schools will be imposed from 2007.

Binder | The typical monthly mortgage payment that Bay Area buyers committed themselves to paying was $2,867 in December.

Binder reads an excerpt from a book and goes DAAAAAAMN.
Binder | The calm, atomized reaction was also due to what I can only describe as a pervasive, super-human work ethic. The common thread running through all the victims interviews was an insistence on getting to work, often more than an hour before official office hours, and on not inconveniencing their colleagues. A number of the victims were going into work although they were feverish with a flu or cold; this made many think that the symptoms of exposure were just a worsening illness, but none of them then thought, oh, maybe I should go home after all. Some victims were so grateful to get a seat on the normally packed train that they put up with the smell even when they began to think it was harming them.

Binder | Of course, the timing of the attacks (early in the morning) ensured that dedicated commuters would be in the majority, and it can hardly be said to be surprising that Japanese salarymen are hard-working. Nonetheless, there is all the difference in the world between a vague stereotype about hard-working Japanese people and the visceral reality of a man whose vision begins to dim as he stares at the bag leaking clear, noxious fluid onto the ground, whose eyes and nose are running, who begins to feel as though he might vomit at any moment, and who thinks only two more stops till I get to the office.

Binder nods.
Crag says, "With autostart, self-maintenance"
Crag says, "And it would run off our gas line"
Crag says, "$2k for the unit, $500 for plumber, $500 for electrician"
Crag says, "And then maybe $100 a year in upkeep or something"
Crag says, "Like oil and tuning and such"
Crag says, "But damn, I was tempted"
Crag says, "If the Lowes hardware folks had been more clueful I might have been an easy sale"
Crag says, "Because, foolishly, I went there knowing we had the money"
Crag says, "Raine almost fell for it too"
Crag says, "We were there together"
Binder hehs.
Crag says, "But realistically it would do nothing for the value of the house"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "And I can't justify the expense with 'I like to use teh interweb in storms'"
Crag says, "But... damn"
Crag says, "It was like 8kw or something"
Crag says, "More than enough for us"
Crag says, "On the other hand, I understand microturbines are coming along nicely"
Binder says, "Maybe if you had some life-critical electricity needs."
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "more life-critical"
Binder says, "Like if Marco would claw your eyes out if you couldn't have the TV on."
Crag heh
Crag says, "I wouldn't feed a cat like that"
Crag says, "Did you say you started playing with Ruby or Rails or something?  I seem to remember you were talking about it when you first returned to the MOO"
Crag says, "I'm wondering if you've drawn a conclusion on them."
Crag says, "I also have some extreme programming to discuss with you... but now work is demanding my attention again, the fuckers"
Binder says, "I have started playing with Ruby but not yet Rails."
Binder says, "I have not concluded anything yet but I'm enjoying the experience."
Crag says, "Any particular reason?"
Binder says, "My new gig has sort of taken over my brain and I haven't done much more with Ruby."
Crag heh
Crag says, "That's good :)"
Crag says, "I mean, since you like the new gig, it's good that they've taken over your brain"
Crag says, "It's good to have masters one likes."
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "So why I like Ruby so far:"
Binder says, "It looks like smalltalk if smalltalk had been designed after Perl."
Binder says, "It's deeply OO, it's tight like Perl but not whitespace fixated like Python."
Crag says, "That all sounds excellent"
Binder says, "Oh, and it was originally written by a crazy Japanese guy."
Binder says, "Meaning it has some crazy Japanese aesthetics to it."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I wonder if that means it would be easier for Raine to learn than other programming languages"
Crag [to stormagnet]: you should check it out to test my hypothesis :)
Binder [to stormagnet]: You should be the test subject for all of his hypothesiseseses.
Binder says, "Oh, Rails is also generating local VC-buzz."
Binder knows of at least two start ups created specifically to make use of Rails.
Binder says, "They're both running off of angel investor cash but VC type people are sniffing around with interest."
Binder says, "Looking at it anew, Ruby scans quite a bit like MOO code."
Binder says, "So not a big leap for anyone who's made MOO verbs."
stormagnet says, "How about I take a test on the subject of hypothesises?"
stormagnet says, "Or subject a a test to hypothesises?"
Binder says, "Too baroque."
Crag says, "I'm not surprised Rails is drawing VC attention"
stormagnet [to Binder]: Should I fix it then?
Crag hee
Binder [to stormagnet]: Well, fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza, dear Liza.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Well, fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza, dear Liza.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Well, fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza, dear Liza.
stormagnet [to Binder]: With what shall I fix it?
stormagnet [to Binder]: A schtick?
Binder [to stormagnet]: Yeah, that works.
Crag groans
Crag . o O ( wish I'd thought of that joke )
stormagnet [to Crag]: Careful, it's hard to get out of your head
stormagnet [to Crag]: It's schticky.
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet washes her mind out with soap.
stormagnet . o O ( .oO.o.oO. )
Crag [to stormagnet]: you're on a roll!
stormagnet <- unagi
Binder says, "A schticky bun?"
stormagnet says, "oooooh"
stormagnet gives Binder an xp for 'schtickiest'.
Binder returns from the break room with a mug of the champagne of black teas.
stormagnet says, "Oooooh! What, what?"
stormagnet [to Binder]: Gimme!
Binder [to stormagnet]: http://www.theteahouse.com/refblacktea.htm
Binder [to stormagnet]: find string: champagne
stormagnet peers
Binder says, "See, I've drank this tea for years and didn't think anything of it.  Then I noticed the ad copy declaring it the champagne of black teas."
Binder says, "I thought, yeah, RIGHT."
Binder says, "But then I STFW and, turns out, that is what it's called."
stormagnet says, "OH"
Binder says, "This is Twinings branded so it's pretty okay for double bagged presized tea."
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet had not heard Darjeeling heard called that before
Binder still prefers the loose leaf from tea-source.
Binder :)
Binder says, "It sounds ever so more impressive if you call it the champagne of black teas."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That page reminds me"
Crag says, "I wonder if I'm the champagne of anything"
stormagnet says, "I'd been meaning to stock up on Lapsang Souchong"
stormagnet [to Crag]: of ROBOTS!
stormagnet eyes her little baggie of chocolate-covered pretzels, and mourns their extinction
Binder [to Crag]: Not as far as google knows.
Binder [to Crag]: The closest I can find:
Binder [to Crag]: crag is free and open to all
Binder [to Crag]: crag is located within the serpentine falls national park and is administered by calm
Binder [to Crag]: crag is a promontory jutting into derwentwater on a stretch of shore about half a mile from the boat landing stages
Binder [to Crag]: crag is much different
Binder [to Crag]: crag is now open by kind permission of the farmer martin weir
Binder [to Crag]: crag is the beautiful hike in and out
Binder [to Crag]: crag is essentially a fin of rock protruding into the moray firth with most of routes on the east facing side
Binder [to Crag]: crag is an esoteric little gem and makes a nice change from bowden doors and kyloe
Binder [to Crag]: /encpaste
Binder [to Crag]: You make a nice change from bowden doors and kyloe.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Well, there you have it
Binder [to Crag]: So, bravo, good show.
stormagnet [to Crag]: The Oracle never lies!
Binder rather likes how Crag is essentially a fin of rock.
Crag blinks mechanically.
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'Finnish RAWK'.
Binder [to Crag]: crag is not climbed regularly
Binder [to Crag]: crag is perhaps the most popular with beginners and experienced alike
Binder [to Crag]: crag is the home of bob and geraldine hamilton
stormagnet [to Crag]: Do you need to be climbed more regularly?
Crag says, "I like the idea of being popular with beginners and experienced alike"
stormagnet loswes
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "Yes, I think I would like to be climbed more regularly"
Crag says, "And by beginners and experts"
Binder says, "Why have I never met your residents?  The Hamiltons."
Crag [to stormagnet]: They're very small.
stormagnet damns the lag
Crag says, "ARG"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag [to Binder]: they're very small
Crag says, "And not very interesting."
stormagnet [to Crag]: AYou were just being psychic
stormagnet [to Crag]: Because I was TOTALLY thinking it
Binder [to the ice pick]: Tell Crag to smile when he says that.
Crag says, "I DOUBT IT !!!"
Binder asks googlism.com about stormagnet and goes @@.
Crag says, "The oracle never likes"
Crag says, "I wonder if it got that from something I wrote in my blog or something"
Binder asks google directly about stormagnet and is amused to see it offering to correct his spelling to 'astromagnet'.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Also, the Germans appear to be doing something involving you and audio circuitry.
Binder eyes stormagnet suspiciously.
Binder [to Crag]: I can't find the page cited by googlism via google.  Weird.
Binder . o O (  the bubbles in this champagne tea tickle my nose! )
stormagnet says, "oog"
stormagnet says, "class now"
stormagnet idles: grrr
Crag either
Crag says, "I also hope I didn't mis-spell imagination as 'emagination'"
Binder says, "Man."
Binder says, "Norm is having the hardest time getting a consistent RPG going."
Binder says, "Everyone keeps flaking on him."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "If I weren't already over-booked I'd try to connect with those guys again"
Crag says, "But I'm all booked up with the band and the platform/cell project"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "RPG is a low priority in today's world for people in our age band."
Binder had a solid group going on here but then various people went back to school.
Binder says, "Which meant that their CFT was work/sleep/sex dedicated."
Binder says, "Squeezing it in around school."
Binder says, "In the meantime I've gone to a model of just opening the Lair doors at noon on Sunday and if anyone shows up by 1, we play board/card/dice games."
Binder is reminded that he should assemble some 7th Sea CCG decks in case anyone wants to play Sunday.
Binder says, "Last Sunday we played Kult CCG and that was fun[ny]."
Crag . o O ( squeezing sex in around school.  good idea )
Binder idles: LUNCH NOW!
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "Netflix has bRikyu"
stormagnet says, "I swear they didn't the last time I checked"
stormagnet says, "But now they do"
stormagnet queues it up, just in case
stormagnet says, "Netflix has officially shot WAY the hell past Scarecrow in terms of inventory diversity."
Crag says, "It was innevitable"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Do you think I can leave the bath outfitters at the house to do their work while I meet Nicole in the U district between 1 and 4 on Friday?
Crag says, "Eventually Netflix and whatever competitors rise to that level will have every movie ever."
Crag idles lightly to do a little work programming, will check back every few minutes or so
Binder says, "And, in time, the content will be squirted to you, not sent via slow disk."
Crag back
Binder front.
Crag says, "But of course"
Crag says, "I sure do love my Happy Hacker Keyboard."
Crag says, "All of them, for that matter. :P"
Binder brought his HHK in to work.
Binder says, "It is the envy of my nerdier co-workers."
Crag says, "Excellent"
Binder will need to buy a second one for home.
Crag says, "I should send you your DIG HHK :)"
Crag says, "We just use it as a spare right now"
Binder says, "Heh."
Binder says, "If it's USB, I'd take it."
Binder will probably buy the unmarked keys one soon.
Crag says, "It's not."
Crag [to Binder]: that's just crazy
Binder says, "If it's not hotpluggable, it's CRAP!"
Crag says, "I hot-plug ps/2 all the time"
Crag says, "But otherwise, yes"
Binder says, "OK, try this scenario."
Binder says, "Plug some i386 boxes into a video multiplexer."
Binder says, "IE, KVM, but not keyboard or mouse."
Binder says, "Turn them on."
Binder says, "Run them for about an hour."
Binder says, "Now plug a ps/2 keyboard into it [either direct or via KVM]."
Crag says, "hm"
Binder says, "Now try to get themt o respond to keyboard."
Binder says, "That's why I swear by USB."
Crag says, "That's a good reason"
Crag says, "We're not using KVM at DIG anymore"
Crag says, "We unplugged all the Apex stuff last year"
Crag says, "It's still in the cabinets, of course."
Binder says, "console over IP?"
Crag says, "Nah, crash cart"
Crag says, "We do have console over IP in our new machines"
Binder says, "Sad."
Crag says, "But we only have the dedicated network for that in the new datacenter"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Have you seen Rackable Systems boxes?"
Crag says, "I don't believe so"
Binder says, "They've got a daughterboard running what they call Phantom BIOS."
Binder . o O (  ooooh, spoooooooky. )
Binder says, "with serial port out."
Binder says, "rc5 serial, I mean."
Binder says, "And it's got full intervention of the boot process."
Crag heh
Binder says, "ie, Phantom BIOS sits on top of POST, does BIOS control stuff, boot process, console after that."
Crag says, "That all sounds good to me"
Binder says, "So dig this scenario.  Cage full of Rackable Systems, terminal serial to IP box."
Crag says, "HP has iLO which is a second PC inside each machine which inspects the PCI bus and takes over the KVM"
Binder says, "PXE NICs in the Rackables."
Crag says, "And then ships it via a dedicated ethernet port"
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Or even not the PXE."
Binder says, "Because you can go into Phantom BIOS and say 'netboot from this server using tftp'."
Crag says, "Ooo, that's nice"
Binder says, "So you can do a remote reinstall over the serial."
Crag says, "THough I like the 'plug it in and turn it on' approach best"
Binder says, "As if you were standing there int he datacenter."
Crag says, "Sounds like something I should check out at some point"
Binder says, "Yeah, with expect you could probably script the interaction for fire and forget."
Crag nods.
stormagnet [to Crag]: If you put the cats in the garage with some food and toys, and make sure they won't need to go back there (say, to access the water mains.)
Binder says, "Even better, their 1/2 deep 1u boxes."
Binder s/their/they're.
Binder says, "So you can put a ton of the Rackables in the same space you'd put supermicros of compaqs or ibms or dells or whatever Nu boxes you've been using."
Binder says, "Kind of limited in drive bays [ie, ONE] but otherwise they're nice."
Crag [to stormagnet]: roger that
Crag [to Binder]: wow
Crag says, "Developments in scaling up datacenters have been pretty exciting all around"
Crag says, "The HP rack stuff looks like crap to me"
Crag says, "It's better than we have now, but..."
Crag says, "It displays that standard HP lack of genuius"
Binder says, "Google is already saying the limiting factor on server capacity is heat + power."
Crag says, "That's been our experience at DIG too"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "We can't fill our new datacenter more than 50% because of that."
Crag says, "And we didn't realize until too late because someone in management screwed up the communication or something"
Crag . o O ( big surprise )
Crag screams at Newbie Perl
Crag subjects you all to Newbie Perl, because he cares

Crag laughs
Crag says, "Our team is re-writing the servicebounce and related tools this year"

Binder nods.
Binder says, "Didn't servicebounce used to be .bat?"
Crag says, "still is"

Crag heh
Crag says, "Because of him, or something else?"

stormagnet [to Crag]: YES

Crag ..
Crag [to stormagnet]: you still amaze me, but in different ways from before
stormagnet gets it out of her system, a little
stormagnet . o O ( I'm not sure that was a compliment... )
Binder . o O ( but it did complement the conversation topic )
stormagnet . o O ( and that would be *lexical* ambiguity... )
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "An example given for structural ambiguity was "Crowd rushing to see Pope trample 6 to death""
Crag says, "nice!"
stormagnet says, "I'm bad because my *furst* reaction was to read that as POpezilla."
stormagnet s/furst/first
Crag says, "I imagined 6 trampled popes"
Binder would prefer to trample six Popes.  To DEATH.
Crag wins!
Binder says, "And then make papal wine."
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "That's AWESOME"
Crag says, "I'm going insane"
Crag says, "These scripts are driving me insane"
Crag says, "Currently, when Sitescope detects an error, it runs a .bat which runs a .pl which runs a .bat which runs ANOTHER .bat"
Crag says, "The second .bat just changes directories and redirects output"
Binder says, "It's a tidal wave of crap flavors!"
Binder says, "Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate."
Crag says, "I'm on the verge of outburst or something"
Crag says, "it's so brittle and MISSION CRITICAL that I can't safely refactor"
Crag says, "I have a project to replace it all, but it's on hold because of more pressing matters"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "But I have to fix ONE LITTLE thing in the .pl"
Crag says, "And in order to test my change I have to understand the whole chain"
Binder says, "So what's the simplest change to make here?"
Crag says, "I don't think I have to make a change to test this and then back away slowly"
Binder says, "OK, then."
Crag says, "But if I make a change I will roll the middle .bat into the .pl"
Crag says, "I'm just upset because SOMEBODY wrote this crap"
Binder was going to suggest rolling the first .bat into .pl but your way probably works even better.
Crag says, "And they might still work here"
Binder . o O ( somewhere. in the bowels of the enterprise )
Crag [to Binder]: Your suggestion is what I did for OTHER .pls invoked the same way
Crag says, "And it was a vast improvement"
Crag says, "We're using my version now"
Crag says, "What I'm working on now is a virtually identical script"
Binder says, "Isn't that one of the Rules of Grammar from Strunk & White?  Eliminate needless .bat."
Crag says, "Which I never got around to fixing because I wanted to redo the whole thing instead"
Crag says, "pretty much"
Crag says, "Eliminate needles *"
Binder says, "It is hard to be happy with incremental refinement when razing and scratch building is so seXXXXy."
Crag says, "needless"
Crag says, "that's true"
Crag says, "But there's also the 'if I break this I will cry' factor"
Crag says, "And the 'just because it works in testing...' element"
Binder shrugs.
Binder says, "Save what you're replacing, be ready to roll back."
Binder says, "Make the change when nobody's looking."
Crag nods grimly.
Crag also corrects spelling errors in comments
Crag grumbles.
stormagnet has made a foray into the cheap junk-food end of the cafeteria spectrum
stormagnet has not met with much success
stormagnet . o O ( Who. Makes. Calzone. With. CHEDDAR? )
stormagnet . o O ( Not mozzarella + cheddar, oh NO )
Binder says, "The British?"
Binder guesses.
stormagnet [to Binder]: YES. THat would explain EVERYTHING.
stormagnet says, "And the sauce-to-cheese ratio here is NGID"
stormagnet should have stuck with the more expensive, but generally edible, Pagliacci outlet in the HUB
stormagnet says, "I could go with the usually cheap, healthy, tasty Subway"
stormagnet says, "If it didn't have to be eaten with a SPOON by the time these people are done with it"
stormagnet starts to try to think of really lightweight, non-perishable, back-pack safe lunches, that don't involve carrying with any real sense of balance
stormagnet . o O ( bowl noodles + boiling water + foam booty that makes me walk crooked = DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER )
Binder says, "Subway is my fall back lunch option for solo meals."
stormagnet . o O ( and then if I add the crowd element... )
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Binder]: I'm not exaggerating about the spoon, though
Binder gets a six inch no-cheese no-condiment random veggies + fowl sammich.
Binder says, "What do they do, apply au jus?"
stormagnet [to Binder]: they wrap it so loosely that everything ends up at the bottom of the bag
Binder says, "That's a feature!"
stormagnet [to Binder]: I end up having to pick out the napkin and wrapper and eat it like salad
Binder says, "Maybe their salads would be less ... slippery?"
stormagnet [to Binder]: Indeed
stormagnet [to Binder]: Next time, I really should just ask them for salad and a piece of bread
Binder nods.
stormagnet [to Binder]: Either way, I'm stuck at the cafeteria today
stormagnet [to Binder]: Stupid HUB is prohibitively far to walk between classes when I'm this slow
stormagnet <- frustrated
stormagnet . o O ( if only this calzone were of the overly hard/rubbery variety of bad )
stormagnet . o O ( then I could take my frustration out via gnawing )
stormagnet . o O ( alas, it is a limp pile of grease )
stormagnet . o O ( ... )
stormagnet . o O ( a $5 pile of grease )
stormagnet headdesks
Binder says, "Perhaps you could use the $5 pile of grease as a snare to trap something more edible?"
stormagnet drinks a can of ASS to wake herself up for her exam next period
stormagnet [to Binder]: Like sorority girls, perhaps?
stormagnet . o O ( mmmmm... )
stormagnet . o O ( the Taiwanese sorority WAS holding a rush table just outside, too... )
Binder says, "Oooh, Taiwanese."
Binder pictures tiny, well machined parts.
Crag . o O ( when I eat asian I just want more a little later )
stormagnet tries to picture Taiwanese cuisine, and realizes belatedly that she has never had any
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet . o O ( isn't it just pretty much Chinese food? )
stormagnet would probably get her ass kicked for saying that, ever
stormagnet wikipedias
stormagnet  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan%27s_Food
stormagnet says, "Having wikipedia access in class is the Best. Thing. EVAH."
stormagnet wikipediad ditransitive verbs just earlier today
stormagnet says, "There was a whole PAGE on them"
stormagnet says, "Not a stub"
stormagnet says, "Not a reference in a larger page"
Crag says, "nice"
Binder . o O (  blood pudding onna stick? )
stormagnet says, "No, there appears to be an entire, well fleshed out linguistics section"
stormagnet [to Binder]: WHOA. I hadn't gotten that far.
stormagnet says, "ah-HA!"
stormagnet says, "I HAVE had Taiwanese!"
stormagnet says, "Apparantly, they started the bubble tea thing"
Crag says, "wikipedia is where geeks can be geeks and be appreciated for it"
Crag says, "The war geeks fill out the war history stuff, etc"
Binder says, "Yeah.  Given the mostly informal meritocracy."
Crag idles lightly to check in with Allison about his work
Crag says, "yay"
stormagnet [to Crag]: SPILL
stormagnet is yaycravy
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "Just that my script change is done"
Binder ^^
Crag phone
Binder . o O ( no, YOUR mom's on the #!@$%()&!@#$ )
Crag back
Crag says, "I'm now creating the 'change request' to distribute my change to the real servers"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Ah, ITIL."
Crag says, "yup"
Binder [to Crag]: Stop breaking my wall of suppression.
Crag droops his head guiltily.
Crag says, "perforce makes long urls"
Crag says, "Not sure why I mention it here..."
Binder also.
Binder lures Vylar out to a lecture about the 1906 quake.
Crag says, "Did you tell her they found tentacles in the rubble of some of the buildings afterwards?"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "afterwords?  uh"
Crag says, "meh"
Binder says, "Afterswords."
Binder says, "No, but I did tell her we could eat dinner, first."
Binder says, "We do not go out to eat very often."
Binder says, "So it will be a treat for us."
Crag says, "sounds like fun"
Binder says, "We are going to Zatar which sounds to me like the name of a comic book magician."
Binder says, "BEHOLD THE POWER OF ZATAR AS HE LEVITATES YOU OUT OF YOUR PANTS."
Crag says, "and there was much rejoicing"
Binder eyes .ssh/known_hosts.
Binder says, "Now, maybe I imagined this."
Binder says, "But didn't .ssh/known_hosts used to contain human readable names/ip octets?"
Crag says, "yes it did"
Crag says, "They changed it because it was considered a security risk"
Crag says, "The old format is an option though"
Crag says, "The risk was that it would be a hint to worms"
Crag says, "If you use one ssh key everywhere and it's comprimised, obfuscating known_hosts slows an attacker down"
Binder says, "I'm okay with it being a different format if there's something I can do to dump it out as human readable."
Crag says, "I doubt it's possible"
Binder says, "Bummer."
Crag says, "When I get to that version of ssh I'm turning on the 'old format' option, whatever it is"
Crag says, "I _like_ tab completion to include ssh paths"
Binder says, "-DDON'T_BE_A_JACKASS_,_SSH_!"
Crag heh
Binder just wanted to get a list of machines he's connected to in order to make sure he'd updated his ssh key on all of them.
Binder o well.
Binder says, "Que sera fukit."
Binder says, "Oh boy!"
Binder may get to do a release build and push this week!
Binder has been looking forward to this.
Crag . o O ( Oh Boy!  Oh Boy!  I caught a fish! )
Crag hee hee
Binder says, "You've seen AC:DS?"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "We have it from GF right now"
Crag says, "The pointing device helps object movement a lot"
Crag says, "Beyond that... I dunno"
Binder says, "Vy played it on Laws's DS and there was some text she really thought was hilarious from catching a ... bass?"
Binder says, "Something like:  oh, you caught a bass... again.  That's just great."
Crag giggles
Crag says, "yes, the fish messages got better"
Binder says, "Ah, now I remember why I don't tend to subscribe to FOO-users lists."
Binder says, "It's because most posters to FOO-users lists are MORONS."
Crag nodsnods.
Binder goes whee hee hee at his new [work] desktop.

Binder has an itch to just compile shit for fun.
Crag [to Binder]: But can you pound a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
Binder [to Crag]: Not at the moment.
Crag says, "A guy's got to have his standards."
Binder says, "But that's the great thing about standards."
Binder says, "There are so many different ones to choose from."
Crag grins.
Crag [to stormagnet]: VR Studios interview re-scheduled for 3pm thursday next
stormagnet [to Crag]: THURSDAY NEXT!!!
stormagnet says, "So"
stormagnet says, "You know how I mentioned how much I love having access to Wikipedia in class?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "My prof is TOTALLY lifting the bulk of his lectures off it!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag . o O ( I probably would too )
stormagnet says, "Everytime he mentions something"
stormagnet says, "I look it up"
stormagnet says, "And the image on his Powerpoint slide?"
stormagnet says, "And the text?"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "RIGHT THERE"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'd be impressed if he had posted them to WP, but I'm sure that's not the case
stormagnet says, "I mean, he's not really outright plagiarizing, or anything"
Binder AGF.
stormagnet says, "But, yeah"
Crag says, "He could at least give credit"
Crag says, "I hope he's at least putting some effort into verifying the content"
Binder says, "And if you want to know more, visit en.wikipedia.org/blahBLAHblahblah"
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "I wonder how many teacher types are ashamed that WP is a better resource than they are by themselves."
Binder says, "I wonder how one could answer that question."
Binder says, "I guess if you could give personality type quizzes to all of the teachers, filter for the ones who know about WP and use it, and figure out their general ration of shame?"
Binder says, "Tough demographic to assess."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Because I don't imagine too many people would answer yes or no to:  are you ashamed that you use WP as a crutch?"
Crag grins.
Binder . o O ( have I stopped beating my wifeWHAAA? )
Crag says, "If they would just let go of their egos they could work within WP, adding their own contributions, justifying their dependance on it, adn everybody would win"
Binder says, "Vy is very fond of similar tough-to-answer questions."
Crag says, "heh"
Binder says, "Where methodology is just the FIRST hurdle in getting statistical data."
Binder says, "Which is perhaps the breakthrough of Freakonomics."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "i.e., teaching people to look for inobvious handles on difficult to assess data sets."
Binder says, "Things like:  I wonder how many people who die while skydiving learned to tie their shoes at a late age?"
Binder says, "Interesting question to have answered but ... uh ... how?"
Crag says, "That doesn't sound like a very interesting question to _me_"
Binder says, "Think harder!"
Crag says, "but I'm willing to believe some people find it interesting"
Crag heh
Binder says, "Can you perhaps think of other examples which would be interesting to you but hard to ascertain?"
Binder goes to the chalkboard and sketches a bell curve.
Crag says, "probably not :)"
Crag heh
Crag says, "How do I draw in this MUD?"
Binder draws the Leatherman.
Binder stabs Crag with a TheraSense FreeStyle.  Neat!
Binder says, "Hey, cool, I drew with one hand and stabbed with the other."
Crag laughs

Binder tries to think of Crag-interesting questions to illustrate his point.
Crag says, "I have 9 hit points left"
Binder says, "OK, what personality traits determine who will be seen as a leader of an open source software project?"
Crag ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder says, "What factors must influence the success of an open source software project?"
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!

Crag dies from a wound inflicted by Binder with the Leatherman blade.
The Heavens
Well, this is the afterlife.  It's not very interesting.  If only you could live again.  A Happy Angel Food Cake Factory is here.
GhostOfTheManor is here, asleep.
The Entrance Hall
The Ballroom
The Western Fireplace
The West Veranda
The North West Lawn
The Light Forest
The Dense Forest
You see a Bluegum Eucalyptus here.
The Forest Clearing
You see a Thin Kamani and a Thick Kamani here.
Crag opens the screen door.
The Yurt
You are in a building that is the size of a large gazebo or perhaps a small silo. The exterior is covered in ornately-painted canvas, featuring large yellow, orange, and blue Raffaelesco dragons. Inside, the ceiling is covered in a tessellating pattern made up of turtles.  A lumpy pillow is here.  Binder is sitting on it.  A fluffy pillow is here.  A blue bean bag is here.  A red bean bag is here.  An Ol'cafe chair is here.  A Taco Stand is here.  A squishy pillow is here.  A rocking chair is here.  An oriental rug is here.  The screen door to the Forest Clearing is open.
You see a quilt chest here.
Binder is here.  stormagnet is dozing.
Crag has arrived.
The screen door slams shut.
Crag says, "The funny thing is, Todd Shaver came to ask me a question just after I ducked."
Binder [to Crag]: You should have b3een ducking him, not me.
Crag says, "I should have been STABBING him"
Crag says, "nowait"
Crag says, "Hm, just got a popup recommending I install firefox 1.5.0.1"
Crag says, "But I'm not seeing any reference to it on mozilla.com"
Crag . o O ( suspicious )
Crag says, "On the other hand, http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/1.5.0.1.html exists, so maybe it's legit"
Binder reads his grandboss's python.
Binder begins to reconsider learning python.
Crag laughs
Binder madness! | class DailyStatistics:
Binder madness! |         """all the statistics for a single day/week/month.  All the data loading methods are here, so that we can cache
Binder madness! |         daily results to create weekly/monthly/etc reports"""
Binder madness! |         def __init__(self, reporter, date):
Binder madness! |                 self.__dict__.update(locals())

Crag stares
Binder . o O ( rue the day?  who codes like that? )
Crag says, "I have no idea what that is supposed to do"
Binder says, "If I'm reading it right [debatable]:"
Binder says, "this is a class named DailyStatistics."
Binder says, "here is a class documenting comment grouped by TRIPLE QUOTES?!?!"
Binder says, "here is my private initializing function."
Crag says, "I'm with you so far"
Binder says, "The first thing I want to do is copy all of the variables returned by the method which determines what variables I can see in this scope into a hash local to my scope."
Crag ..
Binder says, "Which is idiomatic Python but ... uh."
Binder says, "WHO WRITES A LANGUAGE WHICH NEEDS THAT?!"
Binder drops a Guido van Rossum.
Crag laughs
You see nothing special.
Crag | > look Guido
Crag | You see nothing special.
Binder grins.
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag says, "The MOO Knows."
Crag [to stormagnet]: The latest AdBlock has whitelisting
Binder peers at comments.
Crag idles: meeting
[Idling at 4:42 P.M. on Wed, Feb 1: meeting]
stormagnet [to Crag]: Oooh- I haven't played with it yet!
stormagnet updated her Firefox, though
stormagnet . o O ( I think I made that exam relatively idiot-proof )
stormagnet . o O ( but The Insane Bulgarian is a truly high-quality idiot )
Binder posts a URL which is nsfw.
Binder says, "From jshimmin@ticketweb.com  Wed Feb  1 17:04:24 2006"
Binder -)
Binder says, "http://seattle.craigslist.org/ele/129489632.html"
stormagnet O_O
Binder says, "Pretty much everything you can get on a TV."
Binder googles briefly and discovers that this trend now has a name.
Binder says, "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reflectoporn"
Crag says, "Maybe the poster needs the money from the TV to buy clothes."
Binder says, "Yeah, that's probably it."
Binder starts packing up to head out for a lecture.
Binder idles: shake and bake!
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm just reading a junk post and then heading out

Crag says, "Alright, I'm packing up.  The traffic page looks grim, so I'll probably be there in half an hour"

Crag idles: slogging through idiots
[Idling at 5:55 P.M. on Wed, Feb 1: slogging through idiots]
Binder says, "What fresh hell is this?"
Crag looks around
Crag says, "I don't know that I'd say it's 'fresh'..."
Binder says, "Yeah, it's probably a might dusty and musty."
Crag says, "So I guess the real question is, what stale hell is this?"
Binder picked the wrong morning to start taking allergy meds.
Crag [to Binder]: are you high?
Crag [to Binder]: Is it the migly?
Binder says, "No and no."
Binder says, "Power outage at the colo."
Crag says, "ohhh"
Binder says, "Massive production site disruption."
Crag says, "suck"
Binder says, "allergy meds make me sleepeeee."
Crag says, "When Got.net first went to check out Above.net, Above.net was bragging about their reliable power."
Crag says, "Oh well"
Binder says, "New company, new colo."
Binder says, "Which ALSO brags about their reliable power as they have ON SITE MASSIVE BATTERIES AND GENERATORS."
Binder says, "This is 365main."
Binder says, "And yet.  It's the second time they've lost power to their customers in a year."
Binder says, "So clearly they're wrong or lying."
Crag grins
Crag [to stormagnet]: bath fitter is coming today to do some prep pluming stuff, and then tomorrow they'll do the rest.
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "This Firefox update made the memory leak something like 86 BAZILLION times worse"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I was sorta noticing that"
Crag says, "I was just googling about it, in fact"
Crag says, "I still have the 1.5 install exe if you want to downgrade"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "It crashed my computer"
Crag says, "I'm going to stick with 1.5.0.1 on the theory that the degree of degredation will light a fire under the moz developers"
stormagnet says, "In class"
Crag [to stormagnet]: nice
stormagnet says, "While I was taking notes"
stormagnet says, "For THE MIDTERM"
stormagnet headdesks
Crag [to stormagnet]: While I was taking meeting notes at work yesterday my colinux stopped responding
stormagnet says, "The one that I'm taking TOMORROW MORNING"
Crag says, "I was using colinux to take notes"
Crag says, "So I hear ya'"
stormagnet commisserates
stormagnet passes the bottle
stormagnet busts out a harmonica
Crag takes a big swig, chokes, slurps some more
stormagnet . o O ( you know it's ugly when the harmonicas come out )
stormagnet whacks crag on the back
Crag nods sadly.
stormagnet [to Crag]: I love you man
stormagnet [to Crag]: Don't let those fuckers get ya down!
stormagnet damns the man
Crag [to stormagnet]: totally man
Crag says, "damn the man"
Binder . o O ( man! )
stormagnet BLINKS
Crag shakes a tiny fist. :)
stormagnet says, "Holy shit"
stormagnet says, "The UW wireless in her is FAST"
Crag . o O ( excellent typo! )
stormagnet watches her bittorrent suddenly start ZOOMING
Crag laughs
stormagnet . o O [ oh my ]
stormagnet . o O (  yes )
stormagnet . o O (  yes it is )
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm trying this for the firefox memory leak:
Crag | http://fusion94.org/archives/2005/07/firefox_memory.html
stormagnet peers
stormagnet . o O ( if it will let me.. )
stormagnet eyes the task manager
Crag says, "However, based on my googling, I suspect the mozilla project has fallen victim to the worst memory management trap ever: abuse of refrence counting"
Crag says, "reference counting is supposed to allow different parts of a program to share data without copying it, conserving memory and reducing bus traffic in the process"
Crag says, "In reality it tends to cause memory leaks because most programming projects are bad at enforcing the refcounting policies."
Crag says, "Especially the decrementing of reference counts when an object is no longer in use"
Crag says, "The bad news is, there probably is no project-wide solution to this problem."
Crag says, "The good news is that reference counting usually has a consistent interface which can be tapped for useful information about the offending code"
Binder says, "The new leak is something more than the Flash plugin?"
Crag [to Binder]: It seems like it
Crag says, "And I was having the leak without the plugin"
Crag says, "This is the leak where an idle FF grows to 200+M over night"
Crag . o O ( what is it doing?! )
Crag says, "It could be some plugin or something, for all I know"
Crag says, "I haven't REALLY tried to figure it out, with safe mode or whatever"
Crag says, "But if this goes on much longer I may have to"
Binder hums.
Binder finds this:  http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2006/01/19/what-the-heck-is-with-this-1501-update/
Binder says, "No wonder you couldn't find any official release announcement."
Crag says, "uh oh :)"
Crag laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm not sure why, but I blame you :)
Crag says, "That would certainly explain the ... worsening ... or whatever"
Crag [to stormagnet]: you should probably just download and install the 1.5 package now since you're getting good net
Crag [to Binder]: THat's kinda odd though because I got the 'new release' notification at work where I was still using 1.0.something
Crag says, "I'll have to check that prefs file when I'm at work again"
Binder says, "But a straight up 1.0, not a beta or RC?"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure it was stable"
Binder says, "There's evidently an extension to change your update channel."
Crag says, "Because I didn't want to risk beta stuff on my work machine"
Crag says, "Where it could fuck up my chi :)"
Binder says, "Which you could use to wrestle it back off of the RC/beta to stable."
stormagnet says, "eeeeeeek"
stormagnet says, "Normally, I'd be happy to beta test"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "But I really am not in a good position to be taking that risk right now"
stormagnet downloads a 1.5 installer
Binder diddles around with Google and sighs.
Binder says, "You're not the only ones who mistook the 1.5.0.1RC1 as an official update to 1.5."
Crag says, "haw!"
Binder sees lots of blogs and even news sites proclaiming the news and how horrible it is.
Binder . o O ( morons )
Crag says, "heh"
Binder says, "That's it, I'm selling Mozilla short!"
Binder calls up his stockbroker.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "Yeah, this free software sucks, I'm getting a REFUND!"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Binder says, "Though this does point out a problem with Mozilla's update model."
Crag . o O ( in the market today, Mozilla stock went down a whopping 0 from 0 to 0... )
Crag [to Binder]: totally
Crag says, "I was even going to say as much"
Binder says, "IE, you should have to extra special confirm you really do want to be a beta tester, no fooling."
Crag says, "Or, when it presents the 'new version' thing it could include 'this is beta' somewhere in the dialog..."
Binder goes EH? at the IHT news story:
Binder | The trial of Saddam Hussein was adjourned on Thursday until Feb. 13 after a session in which the judge presided with none of the defendants present.
Binder says, "How do you get to play hooky from your own trial when you're in prison?"
Binder says, "Ehn, fuck it, tell them I have a tummy ache, I'm gonna stay here in my cell and look at my Peanuts collection."
Crag says, "I'm sure there's a lot they're not telling us"
Crag [to Binder]: Maybe he fell down the stairs
Crag says, "and didn't want people to think he was being abused"
Binder . o O ( tyler's words, coming out of my mouth )
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'tyler'.
Binder says, "They're good jailers, they love me, I just get so clumsy sometimes, honest."
Crag grins.
Binder envisions future Firefox update dialogue boxes.  'Click here to confirm you want to update.  Click here to confirm you know it's a beta.  Click here to confirm you're a moron.  Click here to confirm that your mom's a whore.  Click here to be subscribed to our opt-in venereal disease of the month club.  Click here to show you know we're just kidding about the VD.  Click here to show you know that, no, we're not.  Click here to get another checkbox to click [repeat ad infinitum].'
Crag laughs
Crag [to stormagnet]: I swear there was nothing in the dialog I said which said "release candidate" or "beta" or anything.
Crag says, "Arg!"
Binder says, "I'm sure there wasn't."
Binder says, "They have multiple release 'channels'."
Crag [to Binder]: Why do I keep directing speach to you at stormagnet?
Crag says, "I understand the channels"
Crag says, "it's like Debian"
Binder [to Crag]: Because she's more fun to talk to?
Binder dunno.
Binder says, "Maybe we're sitting on a bench with stormagnet between us."
Binder passes a note to Crag behind stormagnet's back.
Crag [to Binder]: It's probably something sick and twisted in my subconscious
Binder says, "Well, what I mean is that they don't differentiate outside of the channel internals."
Binder says, "So 1.5.0.1RCn gets released to beta channel as 1.5.0.1 until it's finalized."
Binder says, "Then it is propagated to the stable channel without changes."
Binder says, "Including rebuild or version symbol updates."
Binder says, "Unlike some shops which do an alpha-beta-rcN release sequence of build, release, edit, build, release, edit, and then go to GM-build-release."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Ok, I can see the point of that"
Crag says, "If you make a change after testing it, it's not tested anymore, even if it's "just a name change""
Crag says, "It would be helpful for the auto-update to prominently display current update channel descriptions or something"
Crag says, "I've got to check that prefs file now and make sure I do have the stupid beta channel on my laptop"
Crag says, "because if I don't, that changes the whole discussion :)"
Binder :)
Crag says, "dammit, this laptop doesn't count 'cause it was my desktop at work which gave me the update recommendation"
Crag says, "I'll have to vpn in"
Crag idles: I hope my DIG desktop lets me connect to it
[Idling at 11:13 A.M. on Thu, Feb 2: I hope my DIG desktop lets me connect to it]
stormagnet says, "Heh, sorry"
stormagnet says, "I'm a little homework-distractipated"
stormagnet [to Crag]: And no, it definitely said NOTHING about being beta
stormagnet just finished downgrading hers
Crag says, "I AM VINDICATED"
Crag says, "I'm on the release channel"
Crag says, "So either 1.5.0.1 has been released since that news release, or the moz team screwed up"
Crag says, "On the other hand, my desktop's FF has been running since yesterday afternoon and is only up to 40M"
Crag says, "bleah"
Crag says, "heh, Allison is a great boss"
Crag says, "She keeps thanking me for my work in such a way that I actually feel appreciated"
Crag says, "I failed to resist the urge to look at work email while checking my desktop"
stormagnet says, "crap"
stormagnet idles: class
Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: I think 1.5.0.1 actually did get released yesterday
Binder [to Crag]: Curious.
Crag says, "They were targeting the end of January, so maybe they... rushed"
Crag says, "Anyway, I'm betting there'll be a 1.5.0.2 RSN"
Crag says, "And addons.mozilla.org is now not working for me"
Crag says, "I wonder if I should try it from IE :)"
Crag does so, just to see what happens
Crag says, "still not working"
Crag says, "must be b0rk3d"
Crag [to stormagnet]: When I hear Colin Melloy I think he sounds like SgWD now.
Crag fails his check against an attack of egoism.
Crag also fails his check versus proctrastination.
Crag says, "My GTD review is going to take TWO DAYS at this rate."
Crag says, "oh well"
Binder says, "D'oh!"
Binder says, "Do you have any way to set a timer?"
Binder says, "Some people have great success using what they call a dash."
Binder says, "Set a kitchen timer for 15 minutes and do nothing but process GTD until it bings and then screw around until you feel like you're procrastinating too much."
Crag says, "I have lots of timing devices at my disposal"
Binder says, "If the timer bings and you're still on a roll, keep going.  You don't have to stop when the timer bings, you just don't let yourself stop until it does."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I might have to try that"
Binder says, "Vy uses a similar method when she's procrastinating on writing."
Crag says, "in this case I keep distracting myself with JunkBBS and the MOO :)"
Binder says, "I should start using it for my Weekly Review as I often find myself going down rabbit trails."
Crag says, "I should probably use a separate screen session for this GTD work"
Binder says, "That is, I find something in my inbox and rather than file it in <=2 minutes, I start doing it."
Crag says, "and detach from this one"
Binder says, "Then hours have passed and my inbox is still full."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "That's something I do."
Crag nods.
Binder closes needless windows for GTD.
Crag says, "I have that problem too"
Binder . o O ( stay on target )
Crag says, "i decided to move my Someday/Maybe wishlist items to amazon where possible"
Crag says, "And ended up doing way more amazon browsing than I needed to"
Crag heh
Binder says, "It's a traaaaap."
Crag says, "OK, I'm posting this message I've been working on to Junk, then detaching from this session."
Crag idles: GTD
[Idling at 11:57 A.M. on Thu, Feb 2: GTD]
Binder zzz
Binder is so groggy.
Crag [to Binder]: how groggy are you...
Binder is so groggy that when a talking polar bear asked him for directions, all he could do was point at magnetic north.
Crag grins.
Crag [to Binder]: that might not have been a polar bear...
Crag says, "It may have been an amphibious albino manatee."
Binder . o O ( ambiguous gazpacho mustache, what? )
Binder puts his head down through his desk and dozes lightly while Rome continues burning.
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet [to Crag]: So, yeah
stormagnet [to Crag]: Tailbone is officially fractured
stormagnet went to Hall Health between periods
stormagnet [to Crag]: BUT, coccyx, not sacral
stormagnet [to Crag]: Which is apparantly significant
stormagnet [to Crag]: And *did* need to be checked
stormagnet [to Crag]: Coccyx = no problem
stormagnet [to Crag]: Sacral would have meant having somebody stick a finger up my bum to set the bone
stormagnet bleaghs
stormagnet [to Crag]: Coccyx is tiny and matters not
stormagnet [to Crag]: And I can officially buy a pad to protect it while boarding, and go to my lesson Sunday
stormagnet [to Crag]: So, yay!
Crag [to stormagnet]: YAY!
Crag [to stormagnet]: Melanie says she and Daniel are going to try to visit in May instead of sooner.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Aw, nuts
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'political genius'.
stormagnet [to Crag]: THat post in Liberal> rocked.
Crag heh
Crag struts
stormagnet just thought of a better way to say that
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'political mad scientist'.
Crag laughs

Crag . o O ( it's about to be a puddle in the middle of stormagnet )
stormagnet says, "It would seem that the counter-intuitive secret to this is going whyen it's really busy, and standing in line forever"
stormagnet says, "Because that's when they schedule the COMPETANT people to work"
stormagnet finished that sandwich just in time for class
stormagnet says, "Whew"
Crag heh
stormagnet idles: classy
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm heading to the Udist to pick you up now.
Crag idles: and how
[Idling at 4:28 P.M. on Thu, Feb 2: and how]
Binder idles: zzz
Crag deidles: nnn
Crag deidles: NNN
Binder eyes Crag.
Crag says, "I was trying to turn the 'z's over"
Crag says, "like they're waking up"
Crag says, "didn't quite work out how I'd hoped"
Binder says, "Maybe you needed more vt100 terminal escapes."
Binder says, "There is a guy in the Montgomery BART Station with a guitar."
Binder says, "He was playing Semi-Charmed Life this morning."
Binder says, "Now that song is stuck in my head."
Binder says, "Next time I see that guy I'm going to punch him in the neck."
Crag says, "A punch in the neck is too good for 'im"
Binder says, "Well, I'm a behaviorist.  I'm not trying to kill him, I'm trying to negatively reinforce the behavior of annoying me."
Binder says, "If I'm going down that path, I guess I should give him money when I like what he plays."
Binder . o O ( if that ever happens... )
Crag says, "There's a guy in Seattle who does the "drums made out of bottles and buckets" thing, and he's good enough for me to pay"
Crag says, "He puts a spring in my step when I hear him, so I'll actually go out of my way to give him a dollar or two."
Crag says, "The guy's pretty awesome"
Crag says, "But he is the exception"
Binder says, "Oh, I think I know that guy."
Binder says, "Or, at least, there was a guy who played bottles and buckets downtown when I worked downtown."
Binder says, "Could be the same guy."
Crag says, "Could be"
Binder says, "Or the heir to his throne."
Crag heh
Binder says, "Heir Apparent to the Kingdom of Improvised Percussion."
Crag says, "A very small kingdom indeed"
Binder says, "I could be bound within a nutshell and count myself a kingdom of infinite space were it not that I have bad gas.  I mean dreams.  Bad dreams!  Hey, who farted in this nutshell?"
Crag [to Binder]: ...
Crag [to Binder]: This is not a shawade.
Binder [to Crag]: Check this out:  http://www.kvm-switches-online.com/scs480r.html
Binder [to Crag]: We bought one of those a couple days ago and I configured it yesterday.
Binder [to Crag]: And it was deployed by my boss last night.
Binder [to Crag]: It's running redhat 8.0 + their mods.
Binder [to Crag]: Off of CF.
=> 62
[used 2 ticks, 0 seconds.]
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "$63 per port is pretty good"
Binder [to Crag]: It's got ssh interface in, and the serial ports are port x port configurable for whether it's DCE or DTE.
Binder [to Crag]: So Any Cable Will Do.
Crag says, "nice"
Binder [to Crag]: It's got a web interface [snore] which is easy to turn off [yay!]
Crag laughs
Binder [to Crag]: And you can ssh in to it.
Crag says, "That's key"
Binder [to Crag]: And set up serial port capture + remote syslogd.
Binder [to Crag]: So you could watch your serial console out, match trigger strings, and syslog it elsewhere.
Crag says, "That's good too"
Binder [to Crag]: This particular model also has local console switching, so you can put a head on it [dedicated or crash cart] and flip flip flip.
Binder [to Crag]: Assuming you've got a serial console out to it.  It's not a KVM in the traditional sense, just a serial port/console plexer.
Binder is pretty stoked about it.
Binder finds the actual product maker's site page for the device.
Binder [to Crag]: http://www.thinklogical.com/products/scsR.php
Crag [to Binder]: DIG is using cyclades devices for serial console concentrators and they are terrible
Crag says, "They have ssh and some of the other things you mentioned, but they are terrible to manage"
Crag says, "And buggy"
Binder [to Crag]: Probably better than no concentrator at all.  Probably.
Crag says, "The httpd crashes on a regular basis"
Crag says, "probably"
Crag says, "Either Paul or Chris Burton picked it out"
Binder [to Crag]: Well, now, if anyone asks, you know of a different/better option.
Crag says, "yeah, if anyone asks"
Crag says, "which they won't"
Binder says, "Aw."
Crag says, "It was like pulling teeth getting the Cyclades devices"
Crag consoles himself with cheese and crackers
Binder . o O (  why would anyone want to manage a computer remotely? )
Crag . o O ( or ever )
Binder . o O (  how can you click on the talking paperclip from another room? )
Crag laughs
Binder . o O ( how can you shovel the coal into the computer's boiler from afar? )
Crag hi5s Binder.
Crag says, "I'm getting Montgomery Burns images in my head now.  That rawks."
Binder grins.
Crag says, "Smithers!  More coal for the comput-o-tron!"
Crag says, "That's a television, Mr. Burns."
Crag says, "Excellent..."
Crag makes up simpsons quotes that NEVER WERE, but are PLAUSIBLE.
Crag also TALKS like Zippy the CLOWN.
Crag EMOTES even!
Crag [to himself]: settle down
Binder steps back.
Binder whistles in a soothing pitch.
Binder ahas! as he finds the answer to a back of the skull question.
Binder says, "http://www.thinklogical.com/support/update.php"
Crag peers
Binder says, "They use fedoralegacy.org to get security update rpms for their pared down RH version."
Binder says, "They're using a stripped down RH8.0 on these boxes."
Binder had been wondering what People Did who still use old RH.
Binder shudders with distaste.
Binder . o O ( it sucked when it was current, why would it being EOLed make it more palatable? )
Crag [to Binder]: ANd before I forget, off the top of your head, do you know a syntax with which to represent a regular expression in Perl without using it?  I want to do something like $pat = "foo", $str =~ /$pat/, but I want the "foo" to look syntactically like a regexp and I want to take the slashes of /$pat/... 
Crag is consulting 'man 3perl binder'
Crag [to Binder]: All of the Toontown stuff still uses RH8.  They're trying to port to FC or EL, but... well, they're trying.
Binder [to Crag]: $pat = '/foo/'; $str =~ $pat
Crag says, "Ah!"
Crag [to Binder]: that's exactly what I was looking for.  you rawk.
Crag says, "Oh, can I do substitution too?"
Crag says, "will 's/foo/bar/' work as expected?"
Crag says, "I suppose I should just test it with -e :P"
Crag . o O ( of course, what I really want is perl6 )
Crag . o O ( maybe I should use Pugs to build my proof-of-concept )
Crag . o O ( HAHAHAHAHAHAH )
Crag says, "GOD I LOVE PERL"
Binder says, "OK, I dug deeper."
Binder says, "What you almost certainly want to do."
Binder says, "Is use eval."
Crag says, "Ah! yes, that sounds about right"
Crag says, "Actually, I should check CPAN to see if my meta problem is already solved"
Crag says, "For some silly reason I was re-inventing the context-less gramar parser"
Crag says, "Why would I do that?  It's that old NIH hang-up I have."
Crag browses CPAN now...
Crag says, "Of course, part of my NIHism is wanting to learn the stuff other people learned when they inventented things there (ITT?)"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Johnny Goodboss had that problem/feature."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "OHHHHH"
Crag says, "How about instead of eval if I use an anonymous sub?"
Binder says, "That's hardcore."
Crag says, "It's Paul Graham hardcore"
Crag tries it out
Binder takes off his hat.  "Paul Graham!"
Crag says, "that guy is such a nut"
Crag says, "My parents sent me Hackers and Painters for christmas"
Crag says, "I'd read half of it on his site already, but reading it in concentration was..."
Crag says, "enlightening?"
Crag says, "frightening?"
Crag says, "something like that"
Crag says, "perl is so great.  Flexible string quoting makes running perl from bash so much less irritating than it would be without it."
Crag says, "I think I'm close to leveling in Perl"
Binder grins.
Binder says, "It occurred to me yesterday that if I'd begun the Junk v2 project in Perl, it'd be done by now."
Binder sighs.
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I shouldn't laugh, but..."
Crag says, "hee hee!"
Crag says, "Have you been doing it in C then?"
Binder says, "But because I was trying to recruit other people to work on it with me, I chose a language they all said they wanted to work in."
Binder says, "Java."
Crag stares
Crag [to Binder]: ..
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "At least it's test friendly"
Crag says, "maybe not as test friendly as perl..."
Crag says, "aheh"
Binder . o O ( @#%$^@$#% )
Crag [to Binder]: I'm sorry man
Binder says, "Eh, junit is quite test friendly."
Crag [to Binder]: How far along has it come?  Surely most of your work will translate quickly when you pick the project back up?
Binder says, "It just turned out that doing easy things is hard in Java and doing hard things is impossible in [some] Java engines."
Crag says, "Yes, that was my experience when I tried to learn Java"
Binder says, "We got a database backend and much of the bbs object abstraction done."
Binder says, "No real UI."
Binder says, "When I revive it, I'm going to START with the UI."
Binder says, "Because I think if there's something to LOOK at and show off in screenshots, people will get involved."
Crag [to Binder]: That's the XP way too
Crag says, "And it goes along with Audrey Tang's thing about designing for fun"
Crag says, "I'm trying to get a UI for my plaform/cell thing going right away"
Crag says, "My first app is going to be a MUD"
Crag says, "So I'm always looking for the miminum I have to do to get a MUD running"
Crag says, "And my platform itself has a text UI I'm working on"
Crag says, "woah, a radio DJ just said, "I just don't care for Spielberg...""
Crag says, "She did say she's ok with his sci-fi stuff :P"
Crag says, "wow, I think these new meds are making my ADD worse"
Crag heh
Binder says, "Hooray for scatterbraining."
Crag takes off his hat.  "Scatterbraining!"
Crag says, "and rots"
Binder says, "Brains ... rot ... Zorak, let's ride!"
Crag laughs and laughs.
Crag mubles vaguely, "I wonder if the chemicals the bath fitter guy is using are trippy..."
Crag says, "After four days of working at DIG, my weekends of diving into perl and debian are incredibly rewarding."
Crag says, "woah, when did Perl subs get prototypes?"
Crag says, "When they said Perl6 features were getting back-ported, I thought they just meant that like how Bush meant we were going to break our oil dependancy."
Binder ers?
Crag [to Binder]: Check out man perlsub
Crag says, "You'll see what I mean right away"
Crag says, "This is in debian stable, too"
Crag | $subref = sub (PROTO) : ATTRS BLOCK; # with proto and attributes
Crag says, "Prototypes and attributes are new to me"
Binder thought Perl had prototyping since Perl 4.
Binder says, "Attributes is newer, though, I think."
Binder says, "Like 5.6."
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "I never knew about prototypes, I thought that was a perl6 thing"
Crag says, "And attributes are definitely new"
Binder says, "No one ever use[ds] prototyping, which is why you haven't seen it before."
Binder . o O ( what, make my Perl more restrictive and informative?  NEVER! )
Binder was doing prototyping in perl5.early but gave it up.
Crag says, "ahh, yes"
Binder says, "Because people who had to read my Perl complained that they didn't understand it."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Is that still the perl zietgiest?  That prototypes are for non-perl people?"
Binder says, "Hard to say.  I haven't yet made a meeting of the local Perl mongers."
Crag says, "I've been watching the various Perl-topic'd RSS feeds I've found"
Crag says, "But I've been looking for perl6 stuff, so I may have missed a lot"
Crag says, "woof.  I'll have to read up on attributes later."
Crag says, "I'm now so used to re-factoring my code that I refactor my english too."
Crag says, "When I write an email it starts out kinda long, then I boil it down"
Binder says, "Good habit to be in."
Crag says, "totally"
Crag [to Binder]: Are you interested in a zaurus emulator (which runs on linux)?
Crag says, "I downloaded a demo and the company's been giving me great support."
Binder [to Crag]: Not presently but perhaps eventually.
Binder [to Crag]: So give me a URL to deliciousmark.
Crag says, "You bet:"
Crag | http://virtera.com/
Crag says, ""I think it's just two people right now"
Binder says, "Cool."
Crag blinks... "Tasha doesn't know what Vogon Poetry is?!"
Crag says, "You think you know somebody..."
Binder has a theory.
Binder says, "It's that Tasha is thin at one end."
Binder says, "... gets thick in the middle ..."
Binder says, "... and then thin again at the other end."
Binder says, "No, that's not it."
Binder says, "My theory is that Tasha has been socialized to act dumb in order to succeed."
Crag says, "I see"
Crag [to stormagnet]: you must be having quite a day to be so quiet
stormagnet wakes
Crag [to stormagnet]: Good timing!
stormagnet was walking her Nintendogs
stormagnet [to Crag]: BUTTPAD
Crag giggles
stormagnet [to Crag]: We got our JapanCic exams back today
stormagnet says, "Civ, that is"
That is not a valid command.
Crag [to stormagnet]: Yeah?
stormagnet [to Crag]: The one I studied like a maniac for, and paniced over because it represents 25% of my grade?
stormagnet [to Crag]: 80A% lousy percent
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Minus that A
stormagnet [to Crag]: WHICH SH
stormagnet [to Crag]: SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
Crag nods solemnly.
Binder is confused and disoriented.
Binder packs his bags for Shelbyville.
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I need to watch more Simpsons"
stormagnet laughs
Binder says, "Oookay, this shouldn't happen."
stormagnet [to Binder]: NO
stormagnet [to Binder]: IT SHOULDN'T
Binder says, "So the console server I blathered about before is connected to the Phantom BIOS of the Rackable System I mentioned before."
stormagnet pretends Binder is talking about her grades
stormagnet [to Binder]: ?
Crag heh
Binder [to stormagnet]: Carry on, pretending.
Crag [to Binder]: So you get full console on your linux machines from POST to login:?
Binder [to Crag]: Yes, but ...
Binder [to Crag]: The Phantom BIOS says the server is off.
Crag says, "yes, buttpad..."
Crag says, "hm"
Binder [to Crag]: But I can connect to the server itself ... via ssh ...
stormagnet has a powerful talent for self-delusion
stormagnet . o O ( BUTTPAD )
Binder [to Crag]: So I can't figure out if I'm looking at the wrong Phantom BIOS via serial or if the Phantom BIOS is d'rang'd.
Crag [to Binder]: Did you get the Phantom BIOS to behave as expected via direct serial?
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "I've got nothin' :)"
Binder says, "Fair enough."
Binder will have to do his own homework on this one.
Crag says, "Wrong server seems like the most likely reason"
Crag says, "but yeah"
stormagnet says, "CRAP"
stormagnet says, "The people I bought my BUTTPAD from don't do Saturday delivery"
Crag groans
stormagnet will have to skip this weekend's lesson :(
Crag [to stormagnet]: That might be for the best anyway
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "D'OH"
stormagnet says, "If I'd called yesterday, I could have gotten a prorated refund for the missed lesson"
stormagnet says, "I left a message"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "They *might* be nice and make an exception "
stormagnet doesn't know
Crag [to stormagnet]: it's out of your hands
stormagnet nods
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet done her best
Crag nods solemnly

Crag sees a bug already, heh
stormagnet [to Crag]: Godiva closes at 9:30 today ^_^
Binder . o O ( debugging via pasting? )
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm kind of thinking, may be stay late at school, see the Blue Scholars, pick up chocolates on the way home?
stormagnet [to Crag]: I have the gift cert. with me :)
Crag [to Binder]: a very weak form of pair programming :)
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "DUDE"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Yeah, that sounds fine
stormagnet says, "I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE THAT JOKE!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "No , wait, that wasn't the joke"
stormagnet says, "Weak Pair programming"
Crag [to stormagnet]: what are you talking about...
Crag says, "is that some kind of physics joke or something?"
Crag looks confused
stormagnet [to Crag]: I guess it was kind of a crap pun ^_^;;
stormagnet [to Crag]: Weak Pair pointers?

Crag says, "I'm loving perl more and more, but I still object to sigils"

Crag creates a new LARP called 'Nemesis: The Monkey'

stormagnet got sandwich salad for lunch again
Crag heh
stormagnet managed to keep it from disintegrating past repair, though
Binder got Subway for lunch, too.
Binder had plans to lunch with Roy.
Binder says, "But Roy was late."
Binder says, "So we didn't actually eat lunch together, we just bought lunch together."
stormagnet says, "Wow- I'm sort of at a loss as to what to with myself"
Binder [to Crag]: Don't you have a list?
stormagnet says, "I have class with the Insane Bulgarian between 2:30 and 3:30, but aside from that, I don't really have anything to do between now and 7pm, when the concert starts"
Crag hee hee
stormagnet says, "I didn't bring any textbooks with me, on account of TEH FOOT"
Binder says, "Surf the internet for pr0n."
Crag [to stormagnet]: I see
Crag [to stormagnet]: I could come get you afterall, but not at 3:30
stormagnet shakes her head
Crag says, "The bath fitter guy wants me here when he finishes and he expects to finish around then"

A few hours later, the masses traveled to the Seahawks hotel in Dearborn to grill Stevens, who was greeted by a swarm about eight-deep that he called "ridiculous."

Stevens said he stood by the comments on Wednesday. "I don't regret it," he said. "I spoke the truth."

Asked about Porter's heated response, Stevens said: "From the history of what I know . and I don't know much about Joey . is that something he likes to do is find something to get motivated."

Otherwise, though, Stevens seemed to want it all to go away.

The rest of the Seahawks greeted the controversy with a figurative shrug of the shoulders.

"I don't feel much about it," Holmgren said. "You won't hear Jerramy say any more about it the rest of the week. I suppose going through Super Bowl week without having something like that come up would be unusual."

stormagnet says, "Ooooh"
stormagnet wwonders if she's on eMusic
stormagnet . o O ( stranger things have happened )
Crag says, "I also wonder"
stormagnet checks
stormagnet says, "Nope"
stormagnet says, "Oh well"
Crag shrugs.
Crag [to stormagnet]: In case you feel like oggling her: http://www.fiona-apple.com/
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "Oh, she's on Sony"
stormagnet says, "No wonder"
stormagnet eyes the script dependencies of this page with vage alarm
Crag heh
stormagnet s/vage/vague
stormagnet <- freudian
Crag says, "I seem to recall Sony tried to squash her and she rallied her fans to sufficient ferver to sway Sony and keep publishing her"
Crag says, "I may be mistaken, though"
stormagnet says, "Sounds likely"

Crag says, "wild"
Binder idles: homeward
< Porcupine has connected.  Total: 4 >
You page Porcupine, "Ryan!"
The screen door opens from the other side.
Porcupine arrives from the Forest Clearing.
Porcupine bows.
Crag [to Porcupine]: Welcome!
Porcupine grins.
The screen door slams shut.
Crag says, "Man, it's been years!"
Crag says, "These two are idle, but I'll make the intros anyway"
Porcupine says, "Yes, a very long time!"
Crag says, "stormagnet is my wife of nearly five years, and Binder is a good friend of mine of nearly four years."
Porcupine waves.  "I'm a Karl Porcupine, aka Ryan :-)"
Crag says, "And for everyone else's scrollback sake, Porcupine is a friend of mine from my ancient ColdMUD programming days"
Crag grins.
Crag [to Porcupine]: So how the hell are you?
Porcupine says, "funny to use this name"
Crag says, "Hee hee, I almost used 'Comrade Porcupine' in my post on your comment page on WP"
Porcupine says, "i'm pretty good.  gainfully employed, married, um, living in Toronto"
Crag says, "All good things!"
Crag says, "And except for the Toronto bit I'm the same"
Crag says, "I'm in Seattle now"
Crag says, "Working for Disney, owning a house, all that mature crap"
Porcupine says, "Ah, cool, rianland"
Porcupine says, "Disney, neat"
Porcupine says, "Yeah, I've got the house thing too"
Crag says, "Yeah, it's not as evil as they say :)"
Crag says, "houses are cool"
Porcupine says, "We just bought ours in... June"
Porcupine says, "Got married in September... "
Crag says, "We bought ours three years ago this May"
Crag [to Porcupine]: Are you still doing anything ColdMUD-esq?
Porcupine says, "Funny to run into an old MOO-type on Wikipedia"
Porcupine says, "Hm, vaguely, yes and no, intermittently"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Same here, pretty much"
Porcupine says, "A few years ago I was writing a new server"
Porcupine says, "when I was unemployed"
Crag says, "I started playing with CM again last year, but dropped it again"
Porcupine says, "i got pretty far and then, well, it got all unstable"
Crag says, "Unemployment is great for that kind of work"
Porcupine says, "totally"
Porcupine says, "I learned a shitload, though"
Crag says, "I've got a new thing I'm working on that you might find interesting"
Crag says, "It stems from CM but from a bunch of other stuff too"
Porcupine says, "then last year we (a couple friends and I) took a branch of "Genesis" and started fixing it up; we've got it sitting in an SVN repository"
Crag says, "Like MojoNation and the semantic web"
Crag says, "nice!"
Crag says, "I still hold a grudge against Brandon :)"
Porcupine says, "yeah, he's a twit"
Crag says, "or Branden, or however he spells it"
Crag says, "yep"
Porcupine says, "did you ever know Bruce?  He worked with Brandon on Genesis.. he also ran Eternal City"
Crag says, "I don't think I did"
Crag says, "I may have met him, but I avoided the whole Genesis thing pretty fiercely"
Porcupine says, "he hates Brandon too"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Everyone should"
Porcupine says, "nobody who worked on Genesis thought much of him"
Porcupine says, "so what's the thing you're working on?"
Crag says, "I'm glad you asked!"
Crag says, "In short it's a new software architechture, sorta"
Crag says, "It's like a cross between every wanky CS subject ever"
Porcupine grins.
Crag says, "So it's got micro-kernelisms, distributed processing, super modularity, etc"
Crag says, "I'm currently calling it either Bio-economic model (BEM) or Somebody Else's Problem (SEP)"
Crag says, "The basic idea is that there are Cells which each do one thing well and Platforms which host cells"
Crag says, "here is no global anything"
Crag says, "no global namespace, no global trust, no global resources, etc"
Porcupine says, "sounds very leibniz :-) windowless monads"
Crag says, "But locally there are competing namespaces, trust authorities, etc"
Crag says, "Awesome!"
Crag says, "That's the best compliment I've heard yet :)"
Crag says, "Come to think of it I better list The Baroque Cycle as an influence"
Porcupine says, "each cell carries mutable state?"
Crag says, "Yes, but not much"
Porcupine says, "the platform is the runtime?"
Crag says, "The platforms manage all resources, including RAM and IO"
Crag says, "Right"
Porcupine says, "have you looked at Erlang at all?"
Crag says, "Not yet, but I will be"
Crag says, "I'm trying to make it language independent"
Crag says, "SO the current cell<->platform interface is stdio"
Porcupine says, "Sounds superficially similar (process orientation, functional language, no global state)"
Crag says, "My docs are at http://twiki.thatsnice.org/bin/view/BEM/WebHome if you want to check it out in detail"
Porcupine bookmarks it for perusal
Porcupine says, "geh, can't take this..."
Porcupine changes his name to Ryan.
Ryan says, "there"
Crag says, "Joule is one of my influences, and I undertand Joule led to E which led to Erlang, or something"
Crag says, "So the similiarity is no coincidence"
Crag [to Ryan]: That's much better
Crag says, "Everyone knows four-letter names are the best"
Ryan says, "Hm, E is the capabilities language... Erlang is quite different"
Ryan says, "both being interesting, of course"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
Crag says, "Elrang is more like Haskell then, or something?"
Ryan says, "hm, not really"
Crag heh
Ryan says, "it's really its own things.  Ericson developed it"
Ryan says, "for telecom purposes"
Ryan says, "it's based on a kind of message passing concurrency.  heavy concurrency"
Ryan says, "like thousands of processes"
Crag says, "That's why I associate it with Joule and E"
Ryan says, "but it's no OO at all... functional with message passing.  if there's an 'object' analog, it's that you can model each object as a process"
Crag says, "Colin always said OO was just functional programming"
Ryan says, "Colin said a lot of things ;-)"
Crag says, "where functions are a superset of objects, or something like that"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I need to list Colin as an influence too..."
Ryan says, "Colin and I had a rather unholy parting"
Crag says, "That's unfortunate"
Crag says, "He is a raging asshole, though"
Crag says, "Self-proclaimed, even"
Ryan says, "I spent some time working on Coldstore for a while, and, yeah, what you said"
Crag heh
Crag says, "He and I always got along very well, but I'm very much the exception as far as I can tell"
Ryan says, "we got a long for a long time."
Crag says, "I mean heck, he refers to his wife as the spousal attack unit"
Ryan says, "anyways, 3 years ago I was writing a thing I called 'mica'"
Ryan says, "it started off as vaguely coldmud-esque, but written in C++ from the ground up"
Crag nods.
Ryan says, "then I got very heavily influenced by a few things:"
Ryan says, "1) functional languages; so it got anonymous lambdas, a VM based around an SECD machine (abstract lispish interpreter), etc."
Ryan says, "2) multiple dispatch"
Crag says, "MMD or message broadcast?"
Ryan says, "multimethod dispatch"
Crag nods.
Crag watches the Perl6 folks closely. :)
Ryan says, "which is really neat if you think about it in the context of prototype OO.  Lee Salzman wrote a very good paper on this topic"
Crag says, "Yeah, MMD makes a lot of sense to me"
Ryan says, "also I realized a lot of flaws with the coldmud model"
Crag says, "It's a natural generalization of polymorphism"
Ryan says, "moo, whatever"
Ryan says, "firstly; no GC of objects, just values... this is a really serious problem"
Ryan says, "and also a very difficult engineering problem"
Ryan says, "which I think I solved, but never got stable"
Crag says, "yeah, I was thinking about object GC last year."
Ryan says, "(difficult in the context of the fact that the object memory is persistent and potentially large)"
Ryan says, "secondly; the concurrency model for MOO, etc. is really seriouslyshitty"
Ryan says, "it's One Big Lock"
Crag says, "exactly"
Ryan says, "no real concurrency"
Ryan says, "so lately I've been working on a project, which is still in its infancy but Sorta Works"
Ryan says, "which is garbage collected MVCC object store"
Ryan says, "MVCC being multiversion concurrency control"
Ryan says, "DB-like semantics; commit/rollback, optimistic concurrency"
Crag says, "I'm not familiar with that."
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "got it"
Ryan says, "it's what part of postgresql uses internally"
Crag says, "That sounds cool"
Ryan says, "my idea is to try and get this to a usable state then host a simple VM overtop of it.. make it client server, and detach the language portion from the DB process itself"
Ryan says, "all of this plods on very slowly ;-)"
Crag says, "Of course"
Crag says, "Work, family and friends all compete with projects for time"
Ryan says, "yes, very"
Ryan says, "so our fork of the cold server is still up somewhere... "
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'd like to check it out some time"
Ryan says, "basically tried to take the 'feeling' of the thing back to pre-brandon days but take advantage of the huge amount of bug fixes and performance improvements that a bunch of the guys did on that team"
Ryan says, "but I _hate_ writing in C"
Ryan says, "and Brandon butchered the make & autoconf stuff for it, so it's really shitty to try and evolve it"
Crag says, "yeah, I didn't think the bug fixes were worth the taint, so I was trying to work from 0.11"
Crag says, "I decided I didn't need Jordan's tasking mods"
Crag says, "but then I got distracted by work, and that was months ago"
Ryan says, "I thought that at first, but there's actually a _lot_ of work that went into Genesis that is non-shit"
Ryan says, "Bruce and Brad and Miro were working on it, and they did some serious profiling in the context of The Eternal City, which is a live ColdMUD that hosts thousands of users and has many gigabytes of DB"
Ryan says, "it's a $$ MUD"
Crag says, "Miroslav!  I haven't talked to him in even longer!"
Ryan says, "I think he's disappeared"
Crag says, "Oh well"
Ryan says, "how does mutation happen in your cell's?"
Crag says, "I don't model biological mutation, if that's what you mean"
Ryan says, "No, I mean state"
Ryan says, "are they mutable"
Crag says, "Oh, they're just full-fledged processes"
Crag says, "Like shell scripts"
Crag says, "Well, perl in this version, but whatever"
Crag says, "The only promise a cell makes is that it speaks the protocol through stdio"
Crag says, "The platform will use OS facilities to enforce resource restrictions"
Crag says, "But otherwise it's just regular programming using whatever language and such that you like"
Ryan says, "ah"
Ryan says, "but you have a 'platform'"
Crag says, "Except you can't open any files or sockets"
Crag says, "RIght"
Crag says, "The platform handles all the dirty stuff"
stormagnet wakes
Crag [to stormagnet]: :)
stormagnet [to Ryan]: Hiya!
Ryan waves.
Crag [to Ryan]: If a cell wants to listen on a port it asks for that service from the platform
stormagnet [to Crag]: What's wrong with five letter names?
stormagnet sniffs dejectedly
Crag [to stormagnet]: They're ok, just not the best.
stormagnet T_T
Crag grins.
Crag [to Ryan]: The model is a little like the coldmud server<->object model
Crag says, "The ColdMUD objects can't do anything without going through a system function, etc"
Ryan nods.
Crag says, "OH YEAH"
Crag says, "THe platform also relies on cells for all the hard work"
Crag says, "So it provides storage but not persistence"
Ryan says, "how's that?"
Crag says, "Persistence is handled by cells on multiple platforms"
Crag says, "They colaborate"
Crag says, "They copy stuff around enough to satisfy whatever contracts they've agreed to"
Crag says, "Likewise with namespaces"
Crag says, "And trust and so on"
Crag says, "That's where a lot of the mojonation / edonkey / etc influence comes in"
Ryan says, "hey, did you ever see MOOnix?"
Crag says, "YES"
Crag says, "sorta"
Ryan says, "err MOOix, or whatever"
Crag says, "I installed the debian package"
Crag says, "yeah, I knew what you meant :)"
Ryan says, "pretty nifty"
Crag says, "Actually, I could count that as an influence too, since programs are objects in that, I think"
Ryan says, "yeah, you really need to try out erlang. you'll like it"
Ryan says, "it doesn't use stdio, but it's own protocol, but it's nifty"
Crag says, "Yeah, I should look at it a little closer too"
Ryan says, "the Erlang runtime is like Unix.  all sorts of tasking primitives"
Crag says, "SO that's pretty much the thing I'm working on"
Ryan says, "neat"
Crag says, "So far I have a platform and cell which talk to each other"
Ryan says, "I think there are many good concepts in the Unix model"
Crag says, "me too"
Ryan says, "for radical parallelism"
Ryan says, "actually there was mention of this somewhere recently.. a halfway intelligent discussion"
Crag says, "On the internet?!"
Crag grins.
Ryan says, "ever read Lambda the Ultimate?"
Crag says, "I don't think so..."
Ryan says, "CS/proglang geek weblog"
Ryan says, "very good"
Crag googles
Ryan |http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/
Crag heh
Ryan | http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1210
Ryan says, "that's the article that will interest you"
Crag says, "Excellent."
Ryan has to idle and run for dinner
Crag says, "Alright, good to see you, we'll talk more later :)"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Did you say the show starts at 7 or 8?
Crag says, "And should I come see it to?"
Crag . o O ( and where will I park :( )
Crag [to stormagnet]: Marco is trying to manipulate me
Marco [to Crag]: Aren't I cute?  Here me mewing?  Don't I sound pittiful?
stormagnet says, "The house just opened"
stormagnet says, "There are some random other people opening first"
stormagnet says, "Were you planning on coming?"
stormagnet can't remember
Crag says, "I hadn't thought about it"
Crag says, "I could totally pass :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "If you want to come, you'll have to get a ticket upstairs"
stormagnet says, "I don't know if there are any left ^_^;;"
Crag says, "I'll skip it"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet got one of the few booths
stormagnet says, "One with a decent view, even"
stormagnet says, "No outlet, though- only one booth in the entire place has an outlet"
stormagnet says, "That one's my favorite, but it's in the closed section T_T"
Crag nods.
stormagnet wouldn't have been able to see or hear anything from over there, anyway
Crag says, "how much battery life do you have?"
stormagnet says, "2:45 on this battery"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "And a charged backup"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Excellent"
Crag says, "I didn't even know you had a spare battery"
stormagnet came PREPARED
stormagnet [to Crag]: I have to shut down to swap them, though
stormagnet says, "There's no spare bay"
stormagnet says, "How wrong is it that I dislike the music they're playing over the PA while setting up enough that I'm considering putting in my headphones and listening to mp3s?"
Crag grins.
Crag . o O ( not very wrong at all )
stormagnet says, "Yeeargh"
stormagnet says, "This opening act is TERRIBLE"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "Random chick-with-guitar-playing-the-SAME-CHORD-OVER-AND-OVER"
stormagnet says, "AND OVER"
stormagnet says, "AND OVER"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm sorry dear
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "The next song in the set?"
stormagnet says, "SAME CHORD"
Crag [to stormagnet]: that must be the legendary 'power chord' we've heard so much about
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
Crag giggles
stormagnet says, "SO BAD"
stormagnet says, "She can't even hold a note without slipping"
stormagnet says, "So now she's trying to do some ani-difranco throaty thing instead"
stormagnet says, "which is a prett6y jarring transition in the middle of a song"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "SWEET BABY JESUS MAKE IT STOP"
stormagnet puts in her headphones
stormagnet says, "Stupid iPod craze"
stormagnet says, "Stupid white cords"
stormagnet says, "I swear, if these things didn't make it so OBVIOUS that I had headphones in, I would have put them in ages ago"
stormagnet says, "But at this point?"
stormagnet says, "I don't particularly care how rude it is"
stormagnet says, "I'm way in the back, anyway"
Crag says, "I don't think anyone will hold it against you"
Crag [to stormagnet]: If I told you you're making my ears bleed with the 'music' your body is making, would you hold it against me?
Crag [to stormagnet]: you can use that line if you want
Crag is a big help
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I actually don't know how late this is going to go"
stormagnet recalls this belatedly
Crag laughs
Crag says, "No skin off my nose"
Crag says, "As long as I get to bed early TOMORROW I'm fine."
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet may take you up on that
stormagnet says, "Ooooh!"
stormagnet says, "The jailbait has arrived!"
stormagnet is somewhat consoled
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm done with the ProjectHistory page for now"
Crag says, "in case you're interested it's at"
Crag | http://twiki.thatsnice.org/bin/view/BEM/ProjectHistory
stormagnet says, "Being so busy lately has made me a lot less tolerant of inferior materials"
Crag says, "And it's still not complete"
Crag heh
Crag [to stormagnet]: That's good
Crag says, "Keep your standards high"
stormagnet says, "Like- why the fuck would I listen to this granola-ballad crap when I have Decemberists RIGHT HERE?!"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "RIGHT HERE IN MY PANTS!  Oh hey Colin, how's it goin'?"
stormagnet gets her Tain on
stormagnet . o O ( poon tain )
stormagnet . o O ( taint )
stormagnet says, "Ditto shitty food"
Crag says, "For that matter, why should I listen to this rockabilly crap when I have the Mocean Worker CD in the other room!"
stormagnet says, "When I have so much trouble resisting all the things I WANT to eat, why should I be eating something I DON'T?"
stormagnet says, "INDEED"
Ryan says, "eating something yummy is the ultimate purpose of me waking up in the morning"
stormagnet pages, "how do I hijack people's speech in this MOO again?"
Ryan says, "to eat is to have an excuse to think"
You page stormagnet, "! is the spoof verb"
Crag [to Ryan]: Well said
stormagnet pages, "It is necessary for my comedic purposes to have an unattributed spoof, with that code-evaluation trick"
stormagnet [to Ryan]: Indeed
Ryan waits patiently for his chinese moon cake
stormagnet gives Ryan an xp for 'foody'.
Ryan says, "love it: http://z.about.com/d/chinesefood/1/0/q/moon01.jpg"
You page stormagnet, "I can't remember!  Ack!"
stormagnet pages, "Ah, never mind, too late for proper timing"
Crag [to Ryan]: That looks interesting
stormagnet pages, "I was going to make Binder say "Yes, have some"
(to stormagnet) Crag grins
Ryan says, "speaking of interesting food items: http://z.about.com/d/chinesefood/1/0/q/moon01.jpg"
Ryan says, "err"
Ryan says, "wrong url"
Ryan says, "rather, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus_tuberosus"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "I totally want to prank someone with those now"
stormagnet says, "Serve them with steamed broccoli and roasted garlic "
stormagnet cackles evilly
Ryan says, "they are delicious"
Ryan says, "except you might fart a lot after eating them"
stormagnet . o O ( delicious DOOM )
Binder says, "Yes. Have some."     --stormagnet
Ryan [to Crag]: I still run into Jordan now and then, btw
stormagnet should plant some of those
Ryan [to stormagnet]: i am going to plant some this spring i think
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Ryan]: what's a good time to plant?
Crag [to Ryan]: Oh yeah, I was going to ask about Him
Crag says, "er, 'him', even"
Ryan says, "I am married to his ex-girlfriend, though"
Crag heh
Crag [to Ryan]: My best friend from highschol's two best relationships have been with friends of mine
Ryan says, "Jordan and I lived together for a while when I first moved to Toronto in 1996, actually."
Crag says, "I might have known that"
Ryan says, "We talked about computers incessantly and drove our girlfriends nuts."
Crag heh
Crag [to Ryan]: stormagnet and I drive our friends nuts talking about geeky stuff
stormagnet says, "Hmmm- we have moved on to much of the same, only now it's a guy"
Crag [to stormagnet]: it's all part of the price you pay to see the Blue Scholars. :)
stormagnet nods solemnly
stormagnet says, "Based on the length of that last set, and my knowledge of how many acts are involved, I will hazard a guess that Blue Scholars will come on at 8 and play for about an hour"
Crag [to stormagnet]: cool
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'd like you to check out my ProjectHistory page some day and see if you can think of anything I've left out, especially stuff related to our wine conversations.
Ryan's ear perks up.  "Wine?"
Crag [to Ryan]: We like to watch movies and anime and drink box wine, pausing all the time to talk philosophy and narrative and such
Ryan says, "box wine is making a comeback"
Crag says, "We're into 'Black Box' Merlot right now"
Ryan says, "it has advantages"
Ryan says, "recyclable containers and minimal exposure to oxygen"
Crag [to Ryan]: Quinn was the first person to mention it to me, but stormagnet got us drinking it because of some article she read about it
Ryan says, "means longer shelf-life"
Crag says, "yeah, that"
Crag says, "It means we don't have to drink a bottle at a time"
Ryan says, "that could be good _or_ bad"
Crag says, "We can drink 2/3rds of a bottle or 1.7 bottles at a time"
Crag says, "and it is!"
Crag says, "Good and bad!"
Crag grins.
Ryan says, "I am into Odd wines"
Crag says, "odd?"
Ryan says, "northern wines"
Ryan says, "wines made from odd grapes"
Crag says, "Are their Canadian wines?"
Ryan says, "or in odd places"
Ryan says, "sure, there's lots of canadian wines, most of which are very convential"
Ryan says, "conventional"
Ryan [to Crag]: B.C. has a very nice wine industry, actually... not very different from washington state
stormagnet says, "Ah, now this is much better"
Crag says, "That makes sense"
Ryan says, "same climate, really"
Crag says, "We're rather fond of a washington wine called Salmon Harbor"
Crag says, "yeah"
Ryan says, "and Ontario wines are pretty much like those from upstate new york"
Crag says, "I didn't realize New York had wine too"
Ryan says, "but actually it's a bit warmer than new york in places here because of weird lake effects"
Crag says, "I guess I assumed wine grapes preferred warmer climates"
Crag says, "oh, cool"
Ryan says, "it is HOT here in the summer"
Ryan says, "and we have a long growing season"
Crag says, "I had no idea"
Ryan says, "we are further south than bourgeaux or burgundy, too"
Ryan says, "however, it takes a tough wine to survive the winter some years"
Crag says, "I've always been bad at geography :)"
Ryan grins
Ryan says, "s/bourgeaux/bourdeaux"
Ryan says, "I'm a wine freak, I could go on about it all night.  Shut me up."
Crag says, "We dig wine"
Ryan | I refined this model further. I postulated a system in which all data and functionality is expressed in terms of relationships between objects.
Ryan says, "dude, you need to learn more about the relational algebra and relational databases :-)"
Crag says, "I know"
Crag says, "Who has time to study everything ever! :)"
Ryan says, "But you are also talking about state transitions there, which is something that the relational model doesn't really address"
Crag says, "I should probably mention Unlambda as an influence too"
Crag says, "yeah"
Ryan says, "you should read the third manifesto, tho"
Crag says, "I was looking for something all-encompassing"
Crag says, "Third manifesto?"
Ryan | http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201709287/sr=1-1/qid=1139024911/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-7799759-4825732?%5Fencoding=UTF8
Crag peers
Crag successfully truncates the URL to http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201709287/
Crag grins
Ryan says, "sorry :-)"
Ryan <- lazy
Crag says, "no problem"
Crag says, "I actually wrote Amazon about their URLs recently"
Crag | http://twiki.thatsnice.org/bin/view/Thatsnice/ShortAmazonLinks
Crag says, "No response, of course, but whatever"
Crag says, "I'm not saying you'll find that page interesting, just that it's there. :)"
Crag reads the inside flap summary for the 3rd manifesto
Ryan says, "it's pretty nondescript.  lemme see if i can find a better intro"
Ryan says, "or overview"
Ryan | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Manifesto
Crag says, "heh, I should have looked there first"
Crag says, "Woo, I like avoiding arbitrary restrictions"
Crag says, "That's been one of my biggest complaints about... almost everything!"
Ryan says, "there's a link to a postscript version there"
Crag says, "awesome"
Ryan says, "of a subset of the book"
Crag says, "I will totally read up on that later"
Crag says, "One of the problems with this project is that its scope is so huge it covers all the ground which has been covered many times over before and it makes sense to read up on all that, but it's also so much material that I might never finish reading up if I did it as a full time job for 40 years :)"
Crag says, "Gah, forgot to add Design Patterns as an influence."
Ryan says, "you're exploring.  it's a hobby"

Crag says, "wickied is a great name, but a terrible wiki"
Crag says, "For one thing I can't figure out how to enable anonymous access"
