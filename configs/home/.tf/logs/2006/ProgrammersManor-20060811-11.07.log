Binder appears to be staying here, as his junk is piled all over.  There's a door in the north wall which exits back out into the hallway.  A hammock is here.
You see a Lunch Bag, a rack, a Scrabble board, and a timer here.
Binder is here, distracted.
Crag has arrived.
Crag says, "So the lesson is, reboot after changes"
Binder says, "That's an important lesson."
Crag says, "to make sure one didn't break anything"
Binder says, "Though not always applicable."
Binder says, "Only if you change something salient.  :)"
Crag says, "And the other lesson is, clearing /var on reboots is a good idea if all packages know about the policy"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "heh, yes"
Crag says, "actually, the first lesson is, change management"
Crag says, "track changes, backup before and after"
Binder says, "Lesson zero:  revision control."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "sadly, I will probably learn none of these lessons"
Crag says, "I did not write down any of what I did last night"
Crag says, "The fix was re-creating /var/<something>/xen ..."
Binder NtMs at Crag.
Binder POINT.
Binder POINT.
Binder POINT.
Crag heh
Crag says, "NEMESIS"
Crag says, "that's awesome"
Binder really must create a toy to do that for him.
Binder says, "someday."
Binder sighs, laments of his sins.
Crag shrugs

Binder says, "Woo."
Binder finished his Weekly Review.

Devil arrives from the South Third Floor Hallway.
Devil gives Binder a Binder's pet rock.
Devil sits in the hammock.
Binder [to Devil]: Thanks!
Devil [to Binder]: it looked lonely out there
Binder pets the rock.  Nothing happens.
Binder twiddles his digits.
Binder eyes himself suspiciously.
Binder has somehow changed ownership on his .gnupg/*ring.gpg files to root.
Binder wonders what, if anything, he was thinking.
