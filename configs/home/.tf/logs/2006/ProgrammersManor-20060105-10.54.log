Crag says, "Mmm, ildana is so fast"
Crag whuggles multi-gigahertz Amd64 processors
stormagnet says, "hee!"
stormagnet says, "ildana is aptly named"
Crag says, "hrm, ssh-agent not working... hulk ANGRY"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
stormagnet says, "I still haven't played any nintendogs- I found out there's a test in Japanese class tomorrow"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "What coincides with the day she said she'd announce add codes"
Crag says, "Ahh"
stormagnet says, "Methinks this is not a coincidence"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Culling the herd, as it were?"
stormagnet says, "These .25mm pens are Getting It Done, though"
Crag says, "Sweet"
Crag says, "I might have to get some"
Crag says, "I'm still fond of my .5mm mechanical pencils, though"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I believe they make a .3mm version, in case you're looking for something like that."
stormagnet says, "I like the ink, because when I practice kanji with a pencil, it gets all smeared"
Crag says, "But yeah, the importance of The Proper Tools cannot be over-stated."
stormagnet has one ^_^;;
Crag says, "Ah, good point"
stormagnet loves it
stormagnet says, "HAW!"
Crag says, "I'm so happy that you're having fun at school"
stormagnet says, "POINT!"
Crag snickers
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'punny'.
Crag pretends it was intentional...
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "In other news, I have a terrible urge to cut a hole in the wall between the closet in the bedroom and computer room to allow the filing cabinet to slide back enough to close the closet doors."
Crag says, "It's not an urge I would act on without consulting with you, but it's strong never the less."
Crag says, "I'm making a Someday/Maybe item on my zaurus about it right now"
stormagnet says, "Naw- better to find a better location for it"
stormagnet says, "Move the futon and shelves, maybe"
Crag says, "I like the idea of the filing cabinet being hidden"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "I know"
stormagnet says, "Take the handles off?"
Crag says, "Once the computers are in the hall closet I can turn the cabinet sideways."
Crag says, "Have its back against the west wall of the closet."
Crag says, "And then not put anything on the floor in the closet."
Crag says, "Good way to keep the closet tidy, too. :)"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet says, "Excellent plan"
stormagnet says, "And we need to take those boxes out of there anyway, now that we have shelves"
Crag says, "Yeah."
Crag says, "There's SO MUCH to do."
Crag says, "I feel like I should put reminders in my zaurus that say "breath", "sit up straight", "relax""
Crag says, "I don't think it would be helpful though"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Hrm.  My agent is working, it's just not letting me add keys for some reason.  Oh well."
stormagnet says, "Though, for relax, it IS good to set yourself reminders to alternate with something fun/restful"
stormagnet says, "Like reading, or something"
stormagnet says, "Eating"
Crag says, "I got done filing all my zaurus items around 9:30 this morning and now I'm going through my stack of written notes that I created yesterday."
Crag says, "I did set a lunch reminder"
Crag says, "I'm going to combine lunch with paying Citi"
Crag says, "I might go buy chains and stop by CambellNelson, too"
Crag says, "Not sure"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm worried about getting through the entire GTD process before my vacation is over"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I still have about 50 more notes to enter into my zaurus"
Crag says, "And THEN I learn about the review process"
Crag says, "And then I think I might be done with the introductory lesson"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I still have two major chapters to work through"
stormagnet says, "It's a process, and a long one"
Crag says, "Then it's a sort of review section in the book"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "Don't push yourself too hard"
Crag says, "Ha!"
Crag says, "That's pretty funny coming from you :)"
stormagnet says, "Shuddup"
Crag grins
Crag says, "Too bad MOO doesn't have fonts so you could say that scrunched up"
stormagnet says, "Indeed"
Crag says, "Like <span style="font: compressed">shuddup</span>"
Crag says, "I'm going to make a note to think about creating a ColdMUD interface with fancy display features like that"
stormagnet says, "I KNEW IT"
Crag says, "wot"
stormagnet says, "I bit my tongue (finger) put I pictured you making a note in your Zaurus as soon as you said that :)"
stormagnet s/put/but
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I already had a good place to put it"
stormagnet . o O ( how the hell am I making typos out of plosives on a QWERTY?! )
Crag says, "todo:cat=projects,subj=ColdMUD"
Crag says, "It's not a happy hacker"
Crag says, "Does your tablet have a PS2 connector for a keyboard?"
Crag says, "Or is it USB only?"
Crag says, "A lot of laptops are USB only now (mine, for example)"
Crag says, "If it's USB, you could still get a PS2->USB adapter...  we might even have one"
stormagnet says, "yeah, USB"
stormagnet ponders
Crag says, "And since your tablet is convertable, you could use a happyhacker with the screen facing you and the laptop keyboard away from you"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Which I cannot do, and I'm hella jellus"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Things always seem more interesting to me when you display an interest in them"
stormagnet says, "Aw!"
stormagnet says, "I've got to get going to my next class"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "See you again soon"
stormagnet says, "But I should have net there ^_^"
Crag hugs and kisses
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet kisses!
stormagnet gets sappy!!!
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "aaand, I'm back"
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "You wanted to use that blurry monitor, right?  Where should I put it?  Your new office?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "where the even crappierone is now"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I guess I'll move that one to the hall closet where I can use it on servers in emergencies."
stormagnet says, "that's a good use for it"
Crag says, "I have 10 more items to process, I think"
Crag says, "Do you want to leave the new fancy shelves unfinished?"
Crag says, "or was setting them up in the computer room before finishing them a mistake? :)"
Crag says, "I assume it's primarily an aesthetic question, and secondarily a preservative one"
Crag says, "But I don't know much about this sort of thing"
Crag says, "Well, we can talk about it later, I've created a todo item for it"
Crag says, "Sancho's sitting in your chair, and he gives me an annoyed look every time I loudly crumple one of my inbox item sheets. :)"
Crag says, "The cats are completely mellow right now"
Crag says, "Marco is hidden somewhere, probably sleeping, and Sancho is trying to sleep in your chair despite my noises."
Crag says, "OK, now on to processing email items, then I'm done with the initial filing thingie"
Crag says, "I'm replying to an email from Cecilia from September.  Let me know if there's anything you want me to put in it"
Crag says, "actually, I'm done with it so nevermind. :)"
Crag . o O ( class must have gotten interesting or something )
stormagnet says, "Yeeah, I had a lot of notes to take"
stormagnet says, "And the desk was kindof tiny, and MOOing in tablet mode can be a bit of a paijn in the ass"
stormagnet says, "PAIN"
stormagnet says, "meh"
stormagnet says, "I'm on lunch, now"
stormagnet says, "Breaking in my bento box"
Crag says, "I scheduled my lunch for 1pm to avoid traffic"
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "I wish I could"
stormagnet says, "It is SO FUCKING CROWDED"
stormagnet says, "THere was a girl sleeping in what I now consider *my* booth, having sat in it all of once"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Did you sit on her?"
stormagnet says, "There's a nice view, good wireless reception, comfy seatijng, big table, and an outlet underneath"
stormagnet says, "I should have"
stormagnet says, "At least I did manage to find a table with an outlet"
stormagnet says, "rickity and tiny as it may be"
stormagnet says, "Most days, my lunch is during a slow period"
stormagnet says, "But today, meh"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I'm almost done processing my home email."
stormagnet says, "damn, dude"
Crag says, "After that I think I'm going to VPN into work and process my work email"
stormagnet says, "you're on a roll"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "I haven't actually DONE much"
Crag says, "I'm just making lots of todo items"
Crag says, "LOTS"
Crag says, "Hundreds"
stormagnet says, "That IS something"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "As for the shelf"
Crag says, "Ah yes"
stormagnet says, "I have some spray-on polyurethane coating I'm planning to use"
Crag says, "Is it OK to use it indoors?"
stormagnet says, "I'll want to spead some newspappers around, but otherwise, no problem"
Crag says, "Er, I mean to apply it"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I'll open the window"
Crag says, "I'll just er... delegate that to you then... aheh"
stormagnet says, "Hee"
stormagnet says, "I'll do it this weekend"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I've moved that task to Waiting :)"
stormagnet says, "good idea :)"
Crag says, "I just had a ColdMUD idea while I was peeing, so I'll just enter that in now..."
Crag says, "done"
Crag resumes email processing
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "better add toilet breaks to your task list :P"
Crag says, "it sure is handy that I can ssh into wrack from the zaurus.  I've been cut-n-pasting stuff from email to tasks."
Crag says, "I moved lunch to 2 because I'm on too much of a roll to stop now."
Crag says, "I'll be idle a bit while I'm VPN'd to work"
stormagnet says, "wow, that's awesome"
stormagnet says, "I pretty busy eating and catching up on junk, anyway"
stormagnet says, "Your posts in Bean> cracked me up"
Crag back
Crag says, "I have 150 messages at work, so I'm leaving them for when I actually get back"
Crag says, "I'm not going to do WORK work on my vacation"
Crag says, "Anyway, I have a todo item for processing them, so I'm still obeying the rules:)"
Crag says, "heh, junk"
Crag says, "I'm going to head to lunch as soon as you officially go idle again"
Crag says, "I'm going to have my lunch at Hotwire.  Ha."
stormagnet says, "Count me as officially idle- I really need to get to studying, rather than sfcrewing around on junk :)"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I may be idle for quite a while"
Crag idles: lunch and such
[Idling at 1:26 P.M. on Thu, Jan 5: lunch and such]
Crag says, "I'm back!"
Crag says, "I got a present from Bruce.  He sent me a book from my wishlist: "Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done""
Crag says, "The proximity of my progressed Sun to its sextile with my natal Saturn grows every clearer."
Crag says, "And how fitting that I should get these books while the transiting Sun is in Capricorn, which is ruled by Saturn."
Crag says, "My feelings about the influence of Saturn are improving, but slowly, as is Saturn's way. :)"
Crag gives Crag an xp for 'astrology'.
Crag says, "Transiting Pluto squaring my natal Sun next month probably helps too"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "We need to send Bruce and Batgirl presents :)"
Crag says, "Totally"
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'GID'.
Crag says, "The packing slip says he ordered it on the 30th, so I don't feel too bad about not having sent him something to begin with"
Crag says, "We should order them something tonight and address it to Bruce Wayne and Bat Girl."
Crag says, "Or maybe"
Crag says, "Maybe we should ask one of the Comics Junkies what Bat Girl's most obscure alter-ego is"
Crag says, "And use that name"
Crag says, "Heh"
Crag says, "The note he put on the card goes"
Crag | Remeber, to keep the "Chan" in Chanukka! --Bruce
Crag says, "hee hee"
Crag says, "I sure have a long history of attracting good friends"
stormagnet says, "Hmmm..."
Crag er, s/,//
stormagnet says, "My memory leak problems seem to not be accounted for entirely by plugins, after all"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "There are probably multiple leaks and such"
stormagnet says, "168MB balloonage, 1 tab (opened to the Horde)"
Crag says, "I'm sure adobe wasn't doing you the kind of good you'd like it to"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "The Horde uses noisy HTML"
Crag says, "It's a good test of the rendering and Javascript engines"
stormagnet says, "This wasn't adobe- I'd been through a full reboot since then"
Crag says, "I have the horde open too, lemme check my usage"
Crag says, "I'm just under 200M myself"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Hmmm"
Crag says, "I bet the Javascript engine is buggy"
stormagnet says, "That would explain it"
Crag says, "And I bet it doesn't get enough developer testing because the FOSS folks avoid JS like the plague"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm adding a todo on my Z for checking bugzilla to see if they've investigated that angle"
Crag says, "Did you see that Prius UPS thing Laws posted on junk?"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "CRAZY"
Crag says, "I want to do that"
Crag says, "badly"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "I mean, I badly want to do it well :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I believe 6Kw was what the $4k dollar genarators were advertising for output"
Crag says, "I don't know why they list the voltage though, power is independent of voltage"
stormagnet says, "I'ma suck it up and use IE for a while to see if it's process does a comparable ballooning"
Crag says, "Good idea!"
Crag says, "And IE works pretty well with the Horde, I believe"
stormagnet says, "Aw!"
stormagnet blushes
Crag heh
Crag says, "I'm going to guess that IE will not have the same problem"
stormagnet says, "Hmm... I appear to have shown up for this class half an hour early..."
Crag says, "But I'm also going to guess that your memory usage in FF will not go up as fast when you're not browsing the Horde with it."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "lucky me!"
Crag says, "I'm going to try IE too, now that you've mentioned it"
stormagnet will find out the answer to both these questions, and more, in next week's exciting episode off...
stormagnet: DAIGAKUSEI GONE WILD!
Crag says, "IE's Javascript is faster than FF's"
Crag heh
Crag says, "what's Daigakusei?"
Crag says, "Oh cool, email from Casey in Santa Cruz."
Crag says, "Oh hey"
Crag says, "I'll bet the bookmark manager in the Horde works a lot better in IE than in FF"
Crag says, "Wouldn't it be funny if the best reason to use IE were the Horde Project?"
Crag says, "Er, maybe 'funny' isn't the right word"
Crag ...
Crag says, "I have a todo item to upgrade our horde, but I just got notice today that the NEXT version's Release Candidate one came out today."
Crag says, "So another version will probably be out before February."
Crag says, "So I may wait until then to upgrade us"
Crag says, "It's not like any of the current bugs are killing us"
Crag says, "And I've got plenty of other ThatsNice work to do in the mean time"
Crag says, "Why do we call it 'the mean time'?"
Crag googles
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "It's actually one word, 'meantime', and reference.com doesn't give etymology"
Crag says, "This Prius guy is pretty hard-core"
Crag says, "I bet my dad would dig this"
Crag says, "I'm going to send him a link :)"
Crag says, "Wow, horde is MUCH faster in IE"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "No matter what the situation with the leak, Mozilla folks need to tune up their javascript engine"
stormagnet says, "mean = middle"
stormagnet says, "daigakusei are college students"
Crag says, "Ah yes."
Crag says, "IE's memory footprint starts out significantly lower on my machine"
Crag says, "Presumably because the idea of 'extensions' hasn't reached IE as of v6"
Crag says, "Perhaps IE7 will develop comprable bloatability to FF1.5 :)"
Crag says, "I had coffee at Hotwire, and I'm TOTALLY feeling it"
Crag says, "AND IT FEELS GREAT"
Crag says, "RAT"
Crag Er
Crag says, "RAR"
Crag says, "Hee, Tasha is funny"
Crag says, "Assuming that's Thermal Anomaly's meatspace handle"
Crag says, "Oh, where do you want me to pick you up tonight?  Allegro again?"
stormagnet says, "Could you maybe try picking me up at the HUB?"
Crag says, "Where I dropped you off?"
Crag says, "Is there a dry place there for you to wait for me?"
Crag says, "I don't like the idea of you standing in the rain for five to twenty minutes while I fight traffic."
stormagnet says, "That would be the HUB- Husky Union Building"
stormagnet | http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?HUB
Crag peers
stormagnet says, "That's why I was hoping you could pick me up there"
stormagnet says, "THere's a through street behind it that's ideal for picking up / dropping off"
Crag says, "I'm sure that'll be fine, but lemme look at the map and make a plan before I commit :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm sure I can pick you up there"
Crag says, "I'm having trouble with the map, but I'll have it figured out in time"
Crag says, "When will you be ready?"
Crag says, "I've got that page on my Zaurus now, so I will definitely be able to find you"
Crag says, "If I don't hear otherwise from you, I'll assume you'll be waiting there at 7pm"
stormagnet says, "7 sounds about right"
stormagnet says, "I have my cellphone today, so I can call :)"
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "Traffic isn't very bad that late, so I should have no trouble with timing."
stormagnet says, "Yays!"
Crag says, "I'll leave here at 6:45"
Crag says, "We should be home before 7:15"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty hungry"
stormagnet says, "I'm looking forward to dinner :)"
Crag says, "Lasagna?"
stormagnet says, "Sure :)"
stormagnet says, "I was planning on doimg sausages, but then again, I forgot to thaw them ^_^;;"
Crag says, "Excellent.  That was the best non-meat lasagna I remember having."
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "It's highly recreatable :)"
Crag says, "There's no leftovers?"
stormagnet says, "There are"
Crag says, "Oh ok"
Crag says, "I see what you're saying"
stormagnet says, "I'm just saying, for future reference :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "Five minutes left in this class, then I'm shutting maneki down and heading over to my club meeting"
Crag says, "Alrighty"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'll see you at 7 then"
stormagnet says, "See you then :)"
Crag idles: doing the devil's work
[Idling at 4:47 P.M. on Thu, Jan 5: doing the devil's work]
Crag says, "POOH"
Crag says, "The Xen 3.0 thing I told you about requires hardware support which is only just now coming out.  None of the hardware we have now will doit."
Crag says, "And it's not likely that any of our machines could be upgraded to this level."
Crag says, "However, it is interesting to note that IBM appears to be heavily involved in the Xen project, with their primary focus being a port to the PPC970 platform which is the basis for their pSeries servers."
Crag says, "Perhaps IBM is looking to transition not only from AIX to Linux, but from VM/390 to Xen"
Crag says, "Which is just fabulous all around"
Crag brb (ssh-agent fixing again :P)
