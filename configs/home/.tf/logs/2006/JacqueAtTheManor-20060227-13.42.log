The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
A sign here says, `Topic: Froot Loop Hat Head'
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room, a Punching Bag for Binder, a bucket, a mop, and a Wind-Up Mariachi Band here.
Confucious and Devil are here, off in another world.
