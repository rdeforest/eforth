The Deer Trail
A narrow path through the woods.  Leafy branches brush against you.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  The deer trail continues to the southwest and east.

The MOO is currently running version 1.8.2-waif,xml of the LambdaMOO server code.
The core is derived from a JHCore extracted on Oct 20, 1996.
-----
DISASSEMBLE()
=============

Syntax:  disassemble (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>)   => list

Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal ``compiled'' form of the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  This format is not documented and may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of `disassemble()' interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then `disassemble()' raises `E_PERM'.

-----
VERB_CODE()
===========

Syntax:  verb_code (obj <object>, str <verb-desc> [, <fully-paren> [, <indent>]])   => list
     set_verb_code (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>, list <code>)   => list

These functions get and set (respectively) the MOO-code program associated with the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  The program is represented as a list of strings, one for each line of the program; this is the kind of value returned by `verb_code()' and expected as the third argument to `set_verb_code()'.  For `verb_code()', the expressions in the returned code are usually written with the minimum-necessary parenthesization; if <full-paren> is true, then all expressions are fully parenthesized.  Also for `verb_code()', the lines in the returned code are usually not indented at all; if <indent> is true, each line is indented to better show the nesting of statements.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then `verb_code()' (`set_verb_code()') raises `E_PERM'.  If the programmer is not, in fact. a programmer, then `E_PERM' is raised.

For `set_verb_code()', the result is a list of strings, the error messages generated by the MOO-code compiler during processing of <code>.  If the list is non-empty, then `set_verb_code()' did not install <code>; the program associated with the verb in question is unchanged.
