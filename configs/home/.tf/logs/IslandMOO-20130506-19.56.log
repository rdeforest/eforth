The Front Parlour
A room set aside for receiving callers of a more general or unexpected variety. Well appointed, but its formality renders it a bit impersonal.  An oriental rug lies soft underfoot.  A bureau a gradin stands off to the side of the room.  A desk chair is pulled up next to the desk.  A sideboard stands against the wall next to the doors to the foyer.  Across the room, some setees are drawn up in a semi-circle around a tea table.  Opposite the settees, a large marble fireplace occupies the eastern wall. In front of the hearth are a pair of wingback armchairs, with a small occasional table between them.
stormagnet is here, asleep.
