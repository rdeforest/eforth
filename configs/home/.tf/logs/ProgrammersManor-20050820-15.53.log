Greetings Raine --

Here is your horoscope for Sunday, August 21:

Rushing through what's on your agenda might just end up costing you more time in the long run. Instead, make sure you go through everything not just once, but twice. It wouldn't hurt to ask for help, either.

Modern, Cool Nerd
86 % Nerd, 56% Geek, 43% Dork
For The Record: A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia. A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one. A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions. You scored better than half in Nerd and Geek, earning you the title of: Modern, Cool Nerd. Nerds didn't use to be cool, but in the 90's that all changed. It used to be that, if you were a computer expert, you had to wear plaid or a pocket protector or suspenders or something that announced to the world that you couldn't quite fit in. Not anymore. Now, the intelligent and geeky have eeked out for themselves a modicrum of respect at the very least, and "geek is chic." The Modern, Cool Nerd is intelligent, knowledgable and always the person to call in a crisis (needing computer advice/an arcane bit of trivia knowledge). They are the one you want as your lifeline in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (or the one up there, winning the million bucks)! Congratulations!

Drug offsets sleep deprivation effects, in monkeys
Tue Aug 23, 2005 09:45 AM ET

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A drug dubbed CX717, made by Cortex Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, California, reverses the biological and behavioral effects of sleep deprivation, according to results of animal studies.

In an article in the research journal PLoS Biology, Dr. Sam A. Deadwyler and his associates propose that CX717 would particularly benefit individuals affected by extended work hours or night shifts.

To test this possibility, they taught monkeys to perform a "delayed-match-to-sample task," in which they were presented with a single image on a computer screen, then would use a cursor to identify that image in a group of several different images.

During normal alert conditions, performance accuracy of the animals was improved from an average of 75 percent to 90 percent after an injection of CX717. The drug also shortened response times, suggesting that "CX717 also facilitated attentional processes related to speed of responding on successful trials."

When the monkeys were subjected 30-36 hours of sleep deprivation, average performance accuracy dropped to 63 percent, which was restored to 84 percent after CX717 treatment.

The distinct shifts in EEG recordings and changes in brain scans following sleep deprivation were also reversed by drug treatment.

"The fact that (compounds like) CX717 can temporarily alleviate the effects of prolonged periods of sleep deprivation...indicates their potential applicability to many circumstances in which human performance is compromised by extensive sleep loss," Deadwyler and his associates suggest.

They add that these new agents may be preferable to psychostimulants, caffeine or the relatively new anti-sleepiness drug Provigil, because these "may be limited due to their potential for addiction and/or their potent stimulant actions, which can distort cognitive and sensory processes at doses required to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation."

------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts Jr. may have had an inkling he was destined for greatness back in 1985 when, working as a young lawyer in the Reagan White House, he wrote a note to a colleague who had reviewed Roberts's files from his time in the Justice Department to see which ones should be sent to the National Archives.

"How fascinating and edifying it must have been for you to review the files I compiled during my service to the attorney general," Roberts wrote. "I assume that the archivist will deposit my files in one of those hermetically sealed display cases that drop into a concrete vault in the event of nuclear attack, similar to the cases housing the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Once this is done, I will consider donating my personal papers, at a time to be determined by my tax advisers.

"Just in case you're thinking of it," he added puckishly, "if you plant compromising material in my files I will 'amend' your FBI file with a large bottle of 'white-out.' "

find the right depression medication. He suffers from the disease as well and
has seen his fair share of pharmaceuticals whose names sound like characters
in online role-playing games involving civilizations on other planets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sony Corp. is adding Internet access to its Play Station Portable in a bid to increase the mobile gaming device's appeal as a handheld entertainment center, the company said on Wednesday.

Sony Computer Entertainment America is offering PSP users a software upgrade that will allow wireless Internet access on the device, including a new Web browser to connect to news, entertainment content, online searches and e-mail.

The software is also built to increase data security on the device and enhance digital photo-sharing and video playback capabilities, the company said.

"The Internet browser and other added functionality ... will further enhance the user experience beyond the unprecedented portable entertainment already provided by PSP," said Andrew House, executive vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment America.

Japan's Sony has sold nearly 2 million PSP units in North America since launching the product in March.

Oh and did I mention the "tap tap tap" in the ceiling I heard tonight just
before going to bed that is probably a leak in the ceiling?  Yeah, I did, in
a more appropriate room.

But explain to me why I then hear something that sounds like a heavy object
being dropped, a skittering sound, and then no more drip.  But still a damp
spot on the ceiling.

Incontinent ceiling badgers, I guess.  Fuckalujah.

The BBC is reporting that they view the piracy of a Doctor Who episode before its broadcast date earlier this year as a .wake-up call about the demand for new technology., in a refreshing change of opinion from most media/broadcasting corporations, who would damn this piracy without hesitation. They are forming plans to simulcast the television channels BBC1 and BBC2 on the web, as well as allowing users (only in the UK to start with, unfortunately) access to shows for a week after the broadcast date.

I didn't have any trouble commuting and I left around 9.
Muni is having a fare strike starting Sept 1. In other words, you don't pay
and drivers don't collect.
They're trying to get them to reverse fare hikes, layoffs & service cuts.
Seems more effective than a regular strike, to me.
Hit them in the pocketbook.

Crag lol
Crag says, "EmergenTea is what happens when one tips the tea pot"
stormagnet says, "oh NOES!"
Crag says, "That wikiwyg thing is cool, but what would be even cooler would be to have it maintain a connection back to a wiki daemon for coordingating simultaneous edits"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Colin and I were talking about something like this years ago"
Crag says, "Mostly him, actually"
stormagnet says, "And if it could convert between forms properly"
Crag says, "I was just nodding and listening"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "He was talking about something TCL based, but otherwise his purpose and such were identical"
Crag says, "To have active shared rich text"
Crag says, "A wide-area-whiteboard"
Crag says, "WAW"
Crag says, "And for the text to be smart enough to automatically link and all that"
Crag says, "But it would have a client-side element like wikiwyg does"
Crag says, "Which would make it snappy and pretty"
Crag says, "And the server-side would handle the colaborative bits"
Crag says, "good stuff"
Crag says, "It gets me that much closer to my ideal"
Crag says, "I'm going to have to put my biases aside and get cozy with javascript"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Also"
Crag [to stormagnet]: you were right, I was wrong
