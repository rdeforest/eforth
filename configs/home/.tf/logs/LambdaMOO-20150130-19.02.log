                     Running Version 1.8.3+47 of LambdaMOO

PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

For assistance either now or later, type `help'.

Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

You note that the 60 watt incandescent bulb implies that the owner either doesn't care about the environment, or hasn't changed anything since compact flourestent lights became affordable.

Syntax:  @rn

For each collection of mail messages that you read other from your own, a last-read-time is kept.  This command tells you which collections (out of all those you have ever read) have recently had messages added to them, i.e., more recently than when you last did a @read, @prev, @next, or @skip on that collection.

Etymologists' note:  If you thought @rn had anything to do with the popular UNIX newsreading program `rn', it's just your imagination.
The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from other players.  It provides commands to view and manage your own collection of saved messages and, in addition, to browse through other collections that may be available (e.g.,archives of public mailing lists).  Help is available on the following commands:

@mail     -- seeing a table of contents for a collection of email messages
@read     -- reading individual messages 
@next     -- reading the 'next'     message
@prev     -- reading the 'previous' message

@send     -- composing and sending a message to other players
@answer   -- replying to one of the messages in a collection
@forward  -- resending one of the messages in a collection somewhere else

@rmmail   -- discarding some subset of a collection
@unrmmail -- undoing the most recent @rmm on a collection
@unsend   -- try to remove a message you accidentally sent
@renumber -- renumbering the messages in a collection
@keep-mail - marking messages in a collection as exempt from expiration

@mail-option -- describes and sets various customization flags

help mail-forwarding
 -- describes mail forwarding
help message-sequences
 -- describes message-sequences arguments to @mail, @read, @rmm, and @answer.

For viewing collections other from your own, the following commands are useful:

@rn          -- list those collections that have new messages on them
@subscribe   -- indicate that you want @rn to report on a given collection
                  and add yourself to its .mail_notify list
@skip        -- ignore any remaining new messages in a given collection
@unsubscribe -- ignore a given collection entirely from now on
                  and remove yourself from its .mail_notify list
@unsubscribed-- show the mailing lists that you aren't subscribed to.
@subscribed  -- like @rn, but shows all lists that you are subscribed to
                even if they have no new activity

The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from other players.  It provides commands to view and manage your own collection of saved messages and, in addition, to browse through other collections that may be available (e.g.,archives of public mailing lists).  Help is available on the following commands:

@mail     -- seeing a table of contents for a collection of email messages
@read     -- reading individual messages 
@next     -- reading the 'next'     message
@prev     -- reading the 'previous' message

@send     -- composing and sending a message to other players
@answer   -- replying to one of the messages in a collection
@forward  -- resending one of the messages in a collection somewhere else

@rmmail   -- discarding some subset of a collection
@unrmmail -- undoing the most recent @rmm on a collection
@unsend   -- try to remove a message you accidentally sent
@renumber -- renumbering the messages in a collection
@keep-mail - marking messages in a collection as exempt from expiration

@mail-option -- describes and sets various customization flags

help mail-forwarding
 -- describes mail forwarding
help message-sequences
 -- describes message-sequences arguments to @mail, @read, @rmm, and @answer.

For viewing collections other from your own, the following commands are useful:

@rn          -- list those collections that have new messages on them
@subscribe   -- indicate that you want @rn to report on a given collection
                  and add yourself to its .mail_notify list
@skip        -- ignore any remaining new messages in a given collection
@unsubscribe -- ignore a given collection entirely from now on
                  and remove yourself from its .mail_notify list
@unsubscribed-- show the mailing lists that you aren't subscribed to.
@subscribed  -- like @rn, but shows all lists that you are subscribed to
                even if they have no new activity

See `help mail-system' for a description of the programming interface to the mail system.

      < help #11011 >        will show you the verbs and how to use them
    
         At the moment, they include:
          < NYC >              showing a listing of NYC MOOers
          < NYTimes >          showing any pending plans for a get-together

      < @xconnect NYC >      adds you to the channel.
      < look #79000 >        will display the channel commands.

   NYC-area MOOers.  The command < @Duke > will take you there
   automatically.  Guests, visitors and other tourists are admitted to the

   train, < toss token to player > and that player will be admitted into
   the room.  Also in the train is the NYC Filofax(#13311) which functions

   notes and place them into the book -- messages, well-wishes, suggestions

    This is a sequel to the recycled part 1, I made this 'cause it was fun
   to read and people liked writin' to the old one, anyway this list has a
   few rules:
    1) posts need to not have a beginning or an end, so people can follow
   up on them. Posts also need to follow up on the previous post (1st post
   excluded from this rule)
    2) you cannot use good grammar, for the sake of everyone's enjoyment,
   please use poor grammar. Not so bad that it isn't funny, just
   hilariously bad ;)
    3) you shouldn't post following up on your own posts, this is bad form
   (tm) and you could consolidate the whole thing into one friggin' post
   anyway.

   II), Mersenne Prime searches, and anything else that fits the mold of

   heat, and deluding geeks into thinking they are doing something
   worthwhile.

*RPG-ANON, *RANON, *RPGANON, *RPGA, *RPG-ANONYMOUS, *RA, *rpgs, *rpgb  (#503) [Public/Sendable]
    An anonymous list for the RPG.
    
    Is a fellow RPGer annoying you?  Would you feel better if you could
   tell everyone what an idiot this person is?  Afraid you'll be stalked
   and killed if you do?  Fear no more!  Post about it here.  The name of
   an RPG monster will be substituted for your handle.  Hide behind
   anonymity!
    
    This list is NOT to be used for revealing the answers to puzzles.
   Mistakes happen, and the list owner realizes this, but if you're stupid
   enough to do it repeatedly or it's obvious that it is intentional, you
   will be list-banned and outed.  To date only one idiot has been this
   stupid.  I'm hoping that his inability to comprehend the rules as they
   are repeated to him over and over again is just a fluke and isn't a
   representation of the intelligence of a typical rpg'er.
    
    NEW RULES:
    
    1) No ALTS!-style posts. If you have genuine concerns about two
   characters being the same typists, take it to G_M. Or at least learn how
   to make the post interesting.
    2) No Pasha-related flamewars. Petty bitching is fine, but don't turn
   it into a giant production. I don't give a shit who you think is Pasha,
   and neither does anyone else.
    
    Rule violations are determined by the ListNazi. I make no promises to
   be fair and consistent. If you catch me on a bad day, tough shit. I ban
   through handles without checking who the poster is. The first violation
   is a five-day timeout. The second violation is ten days. The third is
   fifteen days, and so on.
Messages to this list are, by default, anonymous.  To send an attributed message, include the line "While it may be true that I am only e1even,^I am very advansed for my age." somewhere in the body.

    However, please refrain from gratuitous flaming and needless personal
    criticism of LambdaMOOers here, although their belief systems may be freely
    dissected without mercy. Bannings for personal attacks or spam will be done
    without notice by the List Goddess.
    
    ** Historical Note: *Atheism was originally created (and maintained for
    years) by Black_Widow (#57980). On Wed November 5th 1997 it was transferred
    to Mooshie (#106469).
    *** The original list, *atheism, ended up with a poor custodian.  *atheist,
    created on September 28th 2008, is intended to carry on the intent of the
    original list's purpose.  Debates about other subjects, including your

    better. Happy posting!
    
    NOTE: Please direct posts about LambdaMOO itself elsewhere.  Posts of this
    nature will be deleted without delay or exception.
    We are looking for an easy way to create an archive of messages.  Contact
    Captain_Murphy if you have any ideas.
    
    Strident, tenacious analysis and editorial is welcome here, but this list
    was created in response to a couple of mendacious spoilers on Cable's
    venerated *curr.  While broad lattitude will be given to any participant,
    persistent and distracting harassment of fellow contributors will result in
    a listban.
    
    Please note: I will not be deleting messages (except as they expire or
    quota demands, and in that case the oldest will be purged).
