The North Vestibule
A smaller vestibule opening onto the Great Hall. The bones of the old castle are exposed here; the walls rough-hewn blocks of black basalt, the floor smoothly polished stone of the same.  A brown Persian rug lies soft underfoot.  Someone has artfully hung a detailed painting on a wall.  Some chaise longues sit under the windows.  A butler's desk is pushed up against one of the walls.  A demi-lune table stands between the doors, ready to receive calling cards.  A porter's chair stands in the middle of the room, facing the doors.  Some tracery windows are carved into the northern wall.
You see Wind-Up Duck, a microphone, and a How $staff will notice people rummaging here.
Crag is here.  stormagnet is dozing.
You rattle the lid, but it refuses to budge. It must be locked.
