Subject:  Ordinals

Funny thing i noticed today.
after playign around with cupids bow, i had more than one arrow on me and wanted to drop them.
to my surprise i couldn't find an orindal argument to put on the object. (i.e. first, second, third...)
please let me knwo if you already have it but if not i have a suggestion.

example time! :)
give 2.apple to 3.bear
although i don't suggest giveing apples to bears unless they are trained not to maul you
and if your surrounded by bears fish would probably be better :)

ANYWAY it shouldn't be too hard too have the parser see if the object has a "." in it and take the number before the . to choose which of the ambiguous matching ojbects to use.
As i said if this is already here i cna't find it :)
thanks for your time

For the benefit of anyone who may be confused by the nomenclature, "2." for "second" and so forth are very common in Romance and Germanic languages  but essentially unknown in the US.

Subject:  invisable properties on object i created?

Useing @copy i took a verb from #97552 and put it on a child of #13131 (yes this makes sense to do and i'll explain the reasoning for it upon request)
I was then goign to make sur ei had all the properties taken care of so the verbs can be executed so i did a @list of the verb in question and saw a contents property.
funyn thing is it wouldn't let me add the property since it said it was already there, so i used "@d <my feature>," and the property wasn't mart of the list! 
it looks liek +somehow+ i have an invisable property that the verb calls on without it showing in the (what i thougt was) all inclusize list that displays when you use "," after the object on the @display verb...
this would make sense IF @copy DOES bring properties over but they shoudl still be listed in @d , right?

Actual commands used (no censoring)
@copy #97552:Look_msg to flag:look_msg
@copy #97552:tell_contents to flag:tell_contents
*** flag is child of #13131 with obj # 64812  ***
@list flag:look_msg
@prop flag.contents
**moo returned with "Propery #64812.contents already exists." 
@d flag,
**moo returned list of properties that goes into flag's ancestory and yet there is no ".contents" nor ",contents" nor "contents" listed there

lol what i do wrong?

Thanks for your time

There are two kinds of properties: builtin properties (which every object has) and user-defined properties.  "@d foo." shows the user-defined properties defined on that object, but doesn't show builtin properties such as .contents.  You can type "@d foo.contents" to see the .contents property.

There are also inherited properties, which are user-defined properties on a parent of the object. You can see these with @d #object,

(yes, use that comma!)

Properties on your object start with . while inherited properties start with a space (meaning they are unchanged) or a comma (meaning they have been changed on your object from the value they were on the parent).
