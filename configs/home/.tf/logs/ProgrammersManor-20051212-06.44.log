Crag says, "There's a company in the Netherlands promoting a small-scale pebble-bed reactor which is completely contained withing a 10 meter cube:"
Crag | http://www.romawa.nl/welcome.html
Crag says, "They advertise an average output of 10Mw, with a 3 year refueling cycle."
Crag says, "And it weighs 2000 tons"
Crag says, "Haven't found any fueling cost projections yet"
Crag says, "HA!"
Crag says, "I know where my starting things with "So..." came from.  Chris Launey does it."
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "These Netherlands folks have a nice twist on the PBR"
Crag says, "They don't do the pebble cycling system, but instead have a self-contained 'cartrige' of reactive matieral which gets replaced every 3-4 years"
Crag says, "And it has what they call 'burnable poison' which are neurtron absorbers that become non-absorbers as the fuel 'burns' so that the output of the cartrige is effectively constant through its life cycle."
Crag says, "This is exciting stuff"
Crag says, "At some point I'm going to make notes on testing some funship ideas on a MOO or MUD."
Crag says, "Use an established RPG system, put in automation for menial tasks, and then invite people to participate in the social experiment"
Crag says, "Then stage emergencies and stuff"
Crag says, "The first person who engineers puppies and kittens that stay puppies and kittens will make bank"
Crag says, "From the reading I've done it doesn't look like reactors smaller than the one I was just talking about would be worthwhile"
Crag says, "The overhead involved in managing the fuel and maintenance doesn't seem like it would scale down very well"
Crag says, "But still"
Crag says, "It's small enough to replace a diesel engine on a large ship and leave room to spare"
Crag says, "And according to the papers on their site, it could supply a town the size of Santa Cruz with all its power at European living standard levels."
Crag says, "The main problem I see now is that anyone who buys into this system is tied down by fuel acquisition requirements."
Crag says, "Which isn't a big deal for regular towns and corporations"
Crag says, "But it would be a big problem for our freedom cell project"
Crag says, "On the other hand, it's conceivable that the freedom cell project could grow strong enough to aquire and process its own fuel."
Crag says, "But that would be WAYYY down the road."
Crag says, "like 50 years"
Crag says, "It's impossible to predict the world stage that far in advance"
Crag babble babble
Crag says, "Heh, that Chilean presidential candidate Laws posted about in Jebbus> is a Libra :)"
Crag says, "And she has Sun conjunct Saturn, within a degree or less, depending on her birth time."
Crag says, "I think I might do a survey of Wikipedia birthday information for famous people and see if I can find any interesting patterns."
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "YAY PBR!"
stormagnet imitates Chris Launey
stormagnet says, "So..."
stormagnet says, "You know how sometimes, with the Xbox, youcan forget that it's Microsoft?"
stormagnet says, "This is not one of those times"
stormagnet says, "The Xbox comes with a 90-day warranty"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "After that, it's $29.99 for a one-year warranty, or $49.99 for a 2 year"
stormagnet didn't buy one
Crag says, "Naturally"
Crag says, "I wouldn't have"
stormagnet says, "The repair would cost $79.99"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Maybe it's time to void the NON EXISTANT WARRENTEE"
stormagnet nods
Crag water dogs all over the place
Crag says, "I'll open it up tonight while you and Nicole are gabbing"

stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "lots of hits"
stormagnet is so very, very unsuprised
Crag says, "hits?"
stormagnet says, "As in, "Wow- lots of people had this problem""
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "The good news is, I found a tutorial on how to replace it yourself"
Crag says, "Awesome!"
Crag says, "Wait, where do we get the parts?"
stormagnet | http://www.llamma.com/xbox/Repairs/thompson_dvd_tray.htm
stormagnet says, "The same page as the tutorials sells them"
stormagnet says, "Though we may not even need to replace it"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet says, "That tutorial is for realigning a jammed disc tray"
Crag says, "That's almost certainly the problem"
Crag . o O ( $80!  For a 15minute fix! )
stormagnet checks the tray type
stormagnet says, "So, ours is a Samsung"
stormagnet says, "So the Thompson trick may not work on it"
stormagnet says, "Apparently, the used 3 different kinds of drives"
stormagnet says, "Punks"
Crag says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "I think the drive realignment will work on a Samsung, though"
Crag says, "In any case, there's no doubt in my mind that this is a case of planned obsolesence"
stormagnet says, "I think maybe they call it the Thompson tutorial just because that was the example drive they used"

stormagnet says, "And THAT is our repair tutorial"
stormagnet says, "Oh, and more good news- I checked BofA, and it looks like the card reader at Anthony's was the point of failure, NOT our account"
stormagnet says, "Same thing happened to me at Minnie's once"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "Crap, I missed the office hours at Husky Winter Sports"

stormagnet says, "I AM anti-establishment, and that's NOT why I hate Microsoft"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I don't know if I am or not"
stormagnet says, "I hate them for the same reason you hate them"
stormagnet says, "Near miss"
Crag says, "And I don't know if I really hate Microsofot or not"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "You're right"
Crag says, "And I would hate them more if their miss were a little nearer. :)"

Crag says, "But you're exactly right"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "They've had so many opportunities which they've taken 50% advantage of"
Crag says, "My curve of appreciation has a dip that starts around 50% and doesn't come up above 'dammit' until around 97%"
Crag says, "Below 40% my appreciation reaction is along the lines of 'whatever'"
Crag says, "I should draw this graph"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "I just made us an appointment to see the dermatologist"
stormagnet says, "December 27 (Tue) at 3 and 3:15, respectively"
stormagnet says, "We'll be seeing the nurse, rather than the doctor, but if the nurse sees anything amiss, she can call the doctor in"
stormagnet says, "(Otherwise, he didn't have an opening until February- eek!)"
stormagnet says, "And said nurse has a specialization in Dermatology, of course, so that's peachy"
stormagnet says, "And Tien of Tien's Gardening Service is coming over tomorrow between 9 and 9:30 am to give me an estimate for regular lawn maintenance (mowing, raking, weeding.)"
stormagnet says, "Aaand- just made an appointment to see Dr. Wagner on Thursday at 1:15"
stormagnet says, "For the arthritis"

Crag says, "That all sounds good to me"
Crag says, "Who's Dr. Wagner?"
stormagnet says, "The guy I saw for my sprain, who first said I have degenrative disc disease"
Crag says, "Oh, ok"
stormagnet says, "At the Ballard clinic"
Crag says, "I remember now"
Crag says, "That was a while ago :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I'm going to have a fairly large (for me) development project to work on early next year"
Crag says, "It's going to be fun"
Crag says, "I may be spending a couple of months developing a suite of perl modules supporting our monitoring and ticketing infrastructure."
Crag says, "I already have a rought sketch of a design in mind"
Crag says, "And the nature of the problem lends itself to application of 'write the test first' development practices."
Crag says, "Some of the tests won't be automatable, but it'll still be a start."
Crag says, "Allison just responded to my project proposal with firm support"
Crag says, "I think 2006 is going to be a good year for me"

stormagnet says, "And inquired gently about when they were planning to let us in on this little change in our account status"

stormagnet says, "I thought tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "Well, I'm afraid it looks like the 16th..."
stormagnet says, "If I hadn't been under the strong impression that they would be released TOMORROW, I would have had the lender contact you."

President Bush today accepted responsibility for going to war in Iraq based on faulty intelligence. "It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong. As president I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq," the president said.

Crag says, "I sure would be happy to see Bush impeached, even if it was a week before his term was up"
Crag says, "He's done more to ruin our image than any other american, ever."
Crag says, "Not to mention the atrocities he's responsible"
Crag says, "Not impeaching him would be an admission that the country condones his behavior, and that sucks"
Crag says, "But I'm preachin' to the choir again"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "You're right, the rest of the stuff on CNN.com was more of the same useless crap"

Crag says, "I'm hoping that other countries will come to his aid"
stormagnet says, "Oh, wait- here's a gem"
------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
The president unexpectedly took questions from the audience, including one from a woman who asked Bush how many Iraqi "civilians, military, police, insurgents, translators" had been killed in the war.

"I would say 30,000, more or less, have died as a result of the initial incursion and the ongoing violence against Iraqis," Bush said. "We've lost about 2,140 of our own troops in Iraq."

White House spokesman Scott McClellan later said Bush was basing his statement on media reports, "not an official government estimate."
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
Crag says, "And wasn't Bush tried and convicted in international court a couple years ago?"
stormagnet says, "Thus demonstrating why he SHOULD NEVER TAKE QUESTIONS"

Crag says, "A domino sort of thing?"
stormagnet says, "I wonder what percentage of the pre-war population that 30k represents"
Crag says, "Bush is basically saying that bringing Democracy to Iraq is a way of seeding such an effect"
stormagnet says, "Iraq ain't all that big, nor populous, yo"
Crag says, "that's another good question"
Crag says, "The number might be more gruesome if scaled up to compare to another country"
Crag looks for figures
stormagnet says, "25.4 million in 2002"
Crag says, "US is around 300 million"
Crag says, "So you could multiply that 30k by 10 for US numbers"
Crag says, "three hundred thousand"
stormagnet says, "I came up with a tenth of a percent"
stormagnet says, "Yep, that's another way to scale it"
Crag says, "What if China had invaded the US, killing 300k people to bring peace and communism"
stormagnet says, "Seriously"
Crag says, "What if Hitler had invaded France to bring peace and naziohwait"
Crag says, "eh heh"
Crag says, "From the information I have, I believe Saddam should be put back in power, and the US should make reperations to Iraq and its neighbors"
Crag says, "Not that the 30k people could ever be made up for"
Crag says, "but still"
Crag says, "How many people is Saddam accused of killing?"
