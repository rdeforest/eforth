The North Vestibule
A smaller vestibule opening onto the Great Hall. The bones of the old castle are exposed here; the walls rough-hewn blocks of black basalt, the floor smoothly polished stone of the same.  A brown Persian rug lies soft underfoot.  Someone has artfully hung a detailed painting on a wall.  Some chaise longues sit under the windows.  A butler's desk lies pushed up against the wall.  A demi-lune table stands between the doors, ready to receive calling cards.  Some tracery windows are carved into the northern wall.
You see Wind-Up Duck here.
Crag is here.  stormagnet is off in another world.
