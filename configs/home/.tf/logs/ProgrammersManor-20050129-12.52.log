The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  You are sitting on it.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.
Minty is here, daydreaming.  stormagnet and enceladus are off in another world.

You [to enceladus]: you'll probably have to re-create yourself.
