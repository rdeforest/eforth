The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room here.
Binder is here, asleep.

Binder has connected.
Crag [to Binder]: You're quick
Binder [to Crag]: Whenever means right away, right?
Binder grins.
Crag says, "obviously!"
Crag says, "heh, unix rulez"
Crag says, "or r00lz, or whatever the kids are saying these days"
Crag says, "I now also have an /etc/cron.monthly/lambdamoo"
Jacque has connected.
You hear a quiet popping sound; Jacque has disconnected.
< Jacque has disconnected.  Total: 2 >
Binder . o O ( time for moo's monthly visitor )
Crag [to Binder]: I'm working on automation to open ssh to IPs which have authed against the Horde, TWiki or LambdaMOO
Crag laughs!
Binder [to Crag]: I've been thinking about port knocking for my home systems.
Binder [to Crag]: Never got around to setting that up for anything and it still seems like a good idea to me.
Crag says, "So rather than grepping for CONNECTED: in 8meg of "CHECKPOINTING:" I can now grep for it in a few k"
Binder [to Crag]: It's on my S/M list now.
Crag says, "I'm not sure where I stand on port knocking"
Binder [to Crag]: Did you ever see mjr's essay on Artificial Ignorance?
Crag says, "I did not, that sounds interesting"
Crag says, "Is it in yuor delicious hooha?"
Binder [to Crag]: Should be, keywords system administration
Crag looks
Binder [to Crag]: You can also STFW for artificial ignorance syslog mjr
Binder [to Crag]: I've finished doing what Vy needed so I'm detaching again from Moon [the Mac mini, SQEEEEE].
Binder idles: i am a zuvembie
Crag [to Binder]: THat's a fine FLA
Crag says, "artificial ignorance sounds exactly like logcheck"
Crag says, "except that logcheck comes with some filters supplied and assigns 'meanings' to expressions"
Binder has found logcheck to be annoyingly pointless.
Crag shrugs
Binder says, "Here's the distinction."
Binder says, "Logcheck has a set of rules of what to look for."
Binder says, "And it scans log files."
Binder says, "And it raises an alert when it finds something suspicious."
Binder says, "And you can tune the rules to pay more attention some things and not tell you about other things which are Known Issues in your environment."
Binder says, "(A lot of no-reverse-DNS in sshd, for example.)"
Binder says, "Artificial ignorance turns it around."
Binder says, "And has rulesets to eliminate EVERYTHING known."
Crag says, "That's just logcheck's defaults"
Crag says, "Logcheck has 'ignore', 'warn', 'freak-out', etc"
Crag says, "If you only use ignore, the result is artificial ignorance"
Binder says, "But it doesn't change the model that the rules are what to care about."
Crag says, "It does if you use it that way, right?"
Crag says, "logcheck, I mean"
Crag says, "I agree that logcheck's mentality is... mental"
Binder says, "It's the fundamental premise of logcheck which is flawed."
Binder says, "Sorry for the idle, there.  SIGVY."
Crag says, "no prob"
Crag says, "Yeah, I agree about that"
Binder went looking for a logcheck man page.
Crag says, "The idea that some messages might be more wrong than others is silly"
Binder says, "Logcheck isn't installed on any system I use."
Binder  :)
Crag says, "same here"
Binder says, "The AI approach is to have a ruleset which throws out everything you know about."
Crag says, "I stopped using logcheck years ago because I got tired of editing rules files"
Binder says, "Then send / store / display anything else."
Binder says, "So it catches all anomalies."
Crag says, "Which is all one cares about anyway"
Binder says, "Rather than the anomalies you tell the system to notice, which is how logcheck works."
Crag says, "security related or not"
Binder says, "Right."
Binder says, "You can apply it to all sorts of debug stuff."
Binder says, "Filter out the stuff which is expected.  Highlight stuff that isn't expected."
Crag says, "Logcheck needs a little YoureNotGonnaNeedIt"
Binder thinks that mjr piece also touches on AV.
Binder says, "It similarly works by using blacklisting."
Binder says, "Virus signature files."
Binder says, "Which is a similarly losing proposition."
Binder says, "Like logcheck, it only works against threats you already know about."
Binder . o O ( and if you already know about them, if you're protected against them, why do you care, and if you're not protected against them, why not?! )
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "oBSD has a facility called systrace."
Binder says, "It's similar to strace + ltrace."
Binder says, "But it logs the behavior profile of an executable to a file."
Binder says, "As a set of permit statements."
Binder says, "Then you, the admin, edit that file."
Binder says, "And you can then jail the executable within the given permissions."
Crag says, "Oh wow, that sounds like a product my friend sells!"
Crag says, "It's called... uh..."
Binder says, "So even if that executable is replaced/trojaned or had a back door, it's locked into the defined space by the kernel."
Binder says, "I'm guessing it will have some code in common with oBSD's systrace."
Crag says, "Yeah, probably"
Binder says, "And it seems to me to have a lot [philosophically] in common with AI."
Crag says, "Unless the oBSD stuff is licensed in a way which would prevent them from making it proprietary"
Crag says, "totally"
Binder says, "Rather, mjrAI as distinguished from Artificial Intelligence or Albert Ienstien, the famous misspelled scientician."
Binder says, "oBSD almost certainly is BSD licensed aka PLEASE RAPE ME."
Binder ahems.
Binder says, "Sorry.  I went to a pgsql ug meeting tonight."
Crag heh
Binder says, "The PUG leader, who works for a company which profits from pgsql, was pressing the person giving a demo to BSD license her code."
Binder says, "ie, so it can be incorporated into what his company sells and profit him."
Binder <- bitter, bitter
Crag says, "I think the product I'm thinking of is called 'intercept' or 'entercept' or some such nonsense"
Crag says, "Same deal though: watch what an app 'normally' does, and then never let it do anything else"
Binder says, "From my POV, one of the distinct differences between mysql & postgresql is that the people who make money from mysql, do it via support, and the ones who do it via pgsql, do it via an embrace, close off, and sell model."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "I'm guessing if that entercept is commercial it's more platforms than BSD."
Binder says, "Hopefully even take-an-execute-profile-here, deploy-it-on-different-architecture."
Crag [to Binder]: yeah, that's kinda shady trying to get people to work for you for free
Binder says, "Otherwise:  why wouldn't everyone who wants that feature use BSD?"
Binder . o O ( maybe they're ignorant )
Binder . o O ( maybe they're lazy )
Binder . o O ( maybe they hate theo de raadt )
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure it's available for all the profitable platforms"
Crag says, "So Solaris, AIX, win32 (gag), etc"
Crag says, "Ok, I found the Entercept page.  They run on Windows, Solaris, HP-UX and Linux.  THey don't list AIX"
Crag says, "I'm guessing IBM has their own stuff that makes Entercept unnecessary or something"
Binder says, "They're missing out."
Binder says, "People who run AIX have money and a willingness to spend it."
Crag says, "Heh, these guys don't support Linux 2.6"
Crag says, "So they're pretty much out of the loop now"
Binder says, "They're falling behind!"
Crag says, "Which doesn't surprise me since McAfee bought them a couple years ago"
Crag says, "I'm betting that's when development stopped :)"
Binder goes BWAHAHAHAHA.
Binder does it again.
Binder says, "Apropos of nothing, Norton is now on my List."
Crag says, "Which list is this?"
Binder says, "Their 'internet' 'firewall' is stupid, blocks things it shouldn't, allows things it shouldn't, and TURNS OFF WINDOWS FIREWALL WHICH FINALLY BECAME USABLE IN THE LAST RELEASE AAAAAUIGH."
Binder says, "Early Against the Wall When the Revolution Comes List."
Crag laughs and laughs
Binder remembers when Norton was the only protection worth having for Windows users.
Crag says, "Norton has been Pure Concentrated Evil for at least five years now"
Binder says, "Now I wouldn't wish Norton on BillG."
Crag says, "Oooo, burn!"
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'ziiing!!'.
Binder grins.
Binder says, "Which brings me back around to my alleged point."
Crag says, "OH WOW!  KEXP is playing a No Means No song!"
Crag says, "And it's "Sex Mad""
Binder whistles.
Crag rocks out with his cocks out.
Binder . o O ( plural? )
Binder steps away.
Crag says, "ALL OF THEM"
Crag says, "too much anime, maybe"
Binder blames Raine.
Binder says, "OK, so, Windows antivirus software."
Binder . o O ( from the department of redundancy department )
Binder says, "It works via signatures, it should work by having a list of Expected Program Behavior and BLOCKING anything NOT on the list and making it easy to edit the list."
Binder says, "Even for Grandma Beulah who has cataracts and the palsy."
Crag feeds the cataracts in hopes that they'll SHUT UP
Crag then watches reruns of MTV's Totally Palsy
Crag follows that up by repeatedly slapping himself with a trout
Binder checks off two demerits on Crag's permanent record.
Crag grins.
Crag [to Binder]: Have you heard of or checked out the 'piggybank' extension for Firefox?  (Semantic web thingie)
Binder [to Crag]: Not until just now.
Binder [to Crag]: Tell me more.
Crag hee hee
Crag says, "It pulls info from pages and can combine the info pulled from different pages.  The example they give is"
Crag says, "You want to meet at a cafe and it needs to be near your work and you also need to know where the nearest parking is"
Crag says, "So you go to google maps and grab the parking and cafe info and piggybank will allow you to put all that on one googlemaps image"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "or something like"
Crag says, "that"
Crag says, "BUT"
Crag says, "That'snot what impressed me"
Binder . o O ( it's got tits? )
Crag says, "It understood my wiki pages well enough to turn my documentation into object relationships"
Crag says, "AND TITS"
Crag says, "nowait. no tits.  YET"
Binder says, "Whoa."
Crag says, "But yeah"
Binder says, "So it's a step towards the model based documentation thing Rich Morin has?"
Crag says, "I was hanging out on the BEM wiki and it 'read' the thing and told me stuff about it"
Crag says, "Exactly!"
Binder says, "Or at least a different approach toward the same goal."
Crag says, "I'm sure it would work on a subversion repository, too"
Crag says, "or whatever"
Binder says, "In that it seems like it derives relationships from metadata and his approach is more like structuring metadata to express relationships."
Crag says, "ANd since it shares the info, it will know that something in the wiki with the same name as something in subversion is probably the same thing"
Crag says, "yes, exactly"
Crag says, "That's why I mentioned it"
Binder has seen some people nattering about doing similar things via greasemonkey.
Binder says, "But no working code have I seen."
Binder . o O ( no grammar proper have I expressed )
Binder . o O ( forsooth, bitches )
Crag says, "I haven't even read the piggybank docs or looked at what options it has"
Crag says, "I just clicked the icon and it told me how many items it gathered and showed me menus for browsing them by title, type, date, description, found, link, image, language, ..."
Binder nods.
Binder finds the piggybank page.
Crag says, "And each item has referrer info and other stuff like that"
Crag says, "this shit is whack, main"
Crag says, "or something"
Binder sighs.
Binder needs fewer priorities.
Binder says, "If I were still a slacker and this were 1995..."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "the important thing is that you now KNOW about it"
Binder laughs.
Crag says, "So if something comes up where this would help you, then there you go"
Binder [to Crag]: :| Piggy Bank is an open source software and built around the spirit of open participation and collaboration.
Binder [to Crag]: :|
Binder [to Crag]: :| There are several ways you can help:
Binder [to Crag]: :|
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Tell your friends about Piggy Bank
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Subscribe to our mailing lists to show your interest and give us feedback
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Report problems and ask for new features through our issue tracking system (but take a look at our future plan first)
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Write screen scrapers for your favorite web sites
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Send us patches or fixes to the code
Binder [to Crag]: :|     * Publish Semantic Web data on your web site (how-to) for Piggy Banks consumption
Binder says, "So you've completed task the first."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Or will have once you've told at least TWO people about it, to attain the friendplural."
Crag says, "I think I told Raine about it"

Crag says, "Too bad NOBODY ELSE LOGGED BACK IN"
Crag shakes a NtM finger around
Binder does the hokey pokey.
Binder turns himself inside out.
Crag [to Binder]: I don't believe it.
Crag says, "I don't think you can turn yourself inside out"
Binder can.  Once.
Crag [to Binder]: I'm tidying up bouncer, and I see you haven't been on the machine since Nov '03, so I'm removing your account from it.
Binder nods.
Binder [to Crag]: Do that.
Crag does
Binder is disappointed in Piggy Bank's tutorial.
Binder says, "The first one fails for me."
Binder says, "That is, it works up until step 11, when I do not have the map option."
Binder says, "But the premise is cool."
Crag says, "WOOOOOO"
Crag says, "I just talked with a recruiter from jobster.com"
Binder stands back while Crag works the mic.
Crag says, "They're converting their servers to pure linux by July"
Binder . o O ( rock jobster. )
Crag says, "They just got a new round of funding and they want to scale up"
Binder . o O ( pure, uncut, China White Linux )
Binder . o O ( up up UP )
Crag says, "They're looking for a pure linux guru to take them to the next level"
Binder [to Crag]: You've been sanctified, right?
Crag says, "They're apache, tomcat, servelets"
Binder drools.
Crag says, "I GUESS!"
Binder says, "Apache 2.0?"
Crag says, "Didn't ask"
Binder asks pesky details.
Crag says, "She's just a recruiter :)"
Crag says, "I'm talking to a techie at 11:30"
Binder says, "Good question to ask the techie."
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "And distro"
Binder says, "Apache 1.3 or 2.0 and WHY."
Crag says, "And hardware"
Binder says, "Oooh la la."
Binder [to Crag]: Congratulations!
Crag says, "and number of ISPs and what kind of network gear and what the net team is like"
Crag [to Binder]: Thank you!
Crag says, "Oh, and they're in Pioneer Square"
Crag says, "two blocks from the smith"
Binder says, "w00t!"
Crag says, "AND"
You see no sm here.
Crag says, "100% medical/dental/whatever/hooker"
Crag says, "And stock options"
Crag says, "And she didn't flinch at $85k"
Binder says, "WOO."
Binder high5s Crag.
Crag does a little dance

Binder gives Crag an xp for ''.
Binder . o O ( speechless )
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "God I want this job"
Crag says, "It'll be like a second chance at the opportunity I had at Tapestry.net"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Designing BEM is getting easier as I keep thinking "You're Not Gonna Need It" and "That's Somebody Else's Problem"."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Streamlined."
Crag says, "I think this is what I wanted Schism to be"
Crag says, "But I wasn't relaxing my mind enough to let the scope expand the way it needed to"
Binder says, "Om."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'm very excited."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Understandably."
Crag posts in Yo>
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "Yo Ho> even"
Crag says, "to encourage interview-boosting rocking :)"
Crag says, "TWiki is vastly more useful with the SectionalEditingPlugin installed."
Crag [to Binder]: So this online mini-game crazy seems to be taking off.  Can you explain the business model to me?  Is it based on subscriptions or advertising or something?  Or is it a dot-com "corner the market, then figure out the business model" thing?
Binder [to Crag]: I will break it down for you.
Binder [to Crag]: The reason it's taking off is that the existing game market is saturated.
Binder [to Crag]: There are a couple obvious titans in that arena but it's a known quantity.
Crag nods.
Binder [to Crag]: Meaning it's got mostly stable revenue, only marginal growth, and the margins are getting cut to the bone.
Binder [to Crag]: Everybody who's going to buy an Xbox 360 probably already has, for example,a nd games are about as cheap as they can get and still support the dev/publish/distribute/promote model which exists.
Binder [to Crag]: So the titans and the wannabes and the bright young things are now looking for an advantage.
Binder [to Crag]: And they've spotted the untapped market of casual game players.
Binder [to Crag]: But, because they've specialized for the existing demographics, they don't quite .. Get It.
Crag says, "that's what I was thinking"
Crag says, "So they're hoping that the costs of the market will stay rediculously low (a datacenter and some developers, possibly enthusiastic college students)."
Crag says, "And that the market will show itself soon?"
Crag says, "Is there any indication yet which revenue model is most workable?"
Crag says, "And stop me if I'm asking anything proprietary :)"
Binder says, "Sorry, SIGWORK.  Where was I?"
Binder says, "OK, so that's Everybody Else."
Crag says, "Ah..."
Binder says, "The company I work for started small [a wannabe] and saw this market."
Binder says, "And so they are pursuing different strategies."
Binder says, "In a sort of shotgun blast style."
Binder says, "So revenue comes from:  giving out free sixty minute gameplay and then upselling for the full version, of our games and other peoples games; partnering with other people to do the same; promotional bundling."
Binder says, "It's small.  The conversion rate of visitors to the site into paying customers is small.  But steady."
Binder says, "So we keep costs low, do percentage deals to compensate people who publish through us, and keep it growing."
Binder says, "This year we've got an ambitious goal of putting out one brand new game by our own developers per month."
Crag . o O ( You charge $20k for taste testing services?  Yeah, I only have to find one customer. )
Binder remembers that cartoon.
Binder says, "Er, commercial."
Crag says, "It was in a fast food add too i think"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Jack in the Box."
Crag says, "that's what I was thinking of, yep"
Crag says, "It is a workable model though"
Crag says, "So your company's value add is connecting small-scale game creators with the new crowd of casual gamers?"
Crag says, "not sure I'm using 'value add' correctly there"
Crag says, "Mostly I'm thinking of everything in terms of BEM now :)"
Binder says, "Yes, that is the value add and you are using it properly."
Binder says, "That is one value add."
Binder says, "We also distribute games from bigger developers who are targeting a new to them market."
Binder says, "Say EA came out with a game which was light and pretty but not very competitive."
Binder says, "They couldn't put it on the XBox, PS/2, GC, whatever, no one would buy it there."
Crag says, "right"
Binder says, "They couldn't box it up and put it in Circuit City, Best Buy, GameStop, EB, etc."
Crag says, "The overheads would be too high"
Binder says, "It wouldn't be noticed on the shelf."
Binder says, "Right."
Crag says, "This sounds like the new music distribution channels too"
Crag says, "emusic et al"
Binder says, "So instead they'd come to us and go 'publish our game, pls'."
Crag says, "Indipendant artists go to online-only publishers.  The new market consists of people who think $15 is too much to pay for 45 minutes of crap"
Binder says, "Right."
Crag [to Binder]: You have answer my question perfectly, once again
Binder beams.
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'answer man'.
Crag says, "And I'm also impressed with your company's model"
Crag says, "It works for me"
Binder is too.
Binder says, "They're Not Evil."
Binder likes that.
Crag [to Binder]: there's only so much room for evil in the world, and you need all the room you can get? :)
Crag ponders what kind of music would properly prep him for a phone interview
Crag says, "ELo maybe"
Crag says, "ELO even"
Binder thinks that'd do it.
Binder . o O ( this call there's gonna be a show down )
Crag belts out, "Mr. Blue, you did it right, but soon comes Mr. Night... Creeping over, feel his hand upon your shoulder, tell the man, we'll remember you this... we'll remember this you this way."
Crag says, "ooo, that's on the album too"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I turn to stone, when you are gone, I can't go on.
Binder . o O [ where lurks raine w/out login ]
Binder says, "Naaah, too forced."
Crag says, "She got to school late, is probably busy dealing with complications"
Crag says, "Yeah, punctuation is cheating anyway"
Crag . o O [ minus raine folks stand alone ]
Crag says, "meh"
Binder . o O [ dots rule your mind ]
Crag laughs
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'wordsquare'.
Binder grins.
Crag says, "maybe today I'll update the MOO score reporting verb to be less spammy"
Binder grins.
Crag says, "I'm putting off GTD 'till tomorrow because I'm too excited about the interview to GTD.  That's my story and I'm stickin' to it"
Binder hums.
Binder [to Crag]: I can't criticize that, I've done the same thing, myself.
Binder [to Crag]: In retrospect, I would have had a clearer mind for having done WR before, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
Crag says, "I already knew this was going to be the hardest week of GTD"
Crag says, "It's a month and change since I read the book"
Crag says, "Now's when it starts to get hard"
Crag says, "But once I get through this I think it'll get easier"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "So I'm trying to be forgiving with myself"
Binder says, "Good plan."
Crag says, "And giving myself plenty of chances to succeed"
Crag says, "So I don't get discouraged"
Crag says, "which is the other reason I'm doing WR tomorrow."
Crag says, "And it was a rough week"
Crag says, "I may just move WR to Friday anyway"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "For me, it doesn't matter which day as much as it matters that it's every week."
Binder says, "If I miss a week, it fucks me up for 2-3 weeks after."
Crag says, "I'm so ADD that I need relatively rigid patterns or I will just skip stuff completely"
Crag says, "Which is why I have to keep a 'number of items needed before leaving the house' in my mind at all times"
Crag says, "For work days it's 6, otherwise 4"
Crag says, "ANd then I pat my pockets and count them when I approach the door to leave"
Crag says, "I use to leave things behind all the time until I developed that habit"
Binder nods.
Binder uses checklists.
Binder often grabs a piece of paper when changing habits and literally lists out objects.
Binder says, "Keys, wallet, coinpurse, kleenex, hpda, fob."
Crag says, "I was working towards that when I started using the hipster PDA"
Crag says, "But I have some kind of mental block about physical objects"
Crag says, "Keeping everything in my leather jacket and always wearing that was handy for a while"
Crag says, "But lately it's been impractical because the jacket is so heavily padded and generally heavy.  It's just unweildy."
stormagnet has connected.
Crag [to stormagnet]: There you are
stormagnet says, "dagnabbit!"
stormagnet missed her precious scroll!
Crag [to stormagnet]: Job call thingie went great, I have another call in 15 minutes or so
stormagnet cheers!!
Binder [to Crag]: Yeah, I use my backpack in that fashion.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I have logs in ~/robert/.tf/logs
stormagnet [to Crag]: I found out why my grade on the Japanese History exam was so terrible
stormagnet [to Crag]: Hint:
Binder [to Crag]: For things I habitually take to work.
stormagnet [to Crag]: IT WASN'T GRADED BY MY TA
Crag says, "Today's log is /home/robert/.tf/logs/ProgrammersManor-20060208-21.48.log"
Crag [to Binder]: Exatly
Crag er, exactly even
Crag says, "There's a typo monster lurking around here..."
Crag [to stormagnet]: So your teacher has a Tragic Flaw then?
Crag says, "Or was it the OTHER TA?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Not even proper TAs!
Crag says, "Monkeys?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: HIRED GRAD STUDENT MONKEYS
Binder . o O ( improper ta-tas? )
Crag . o O ( NtM? )
stormagnet [to Crag]: With a CHECKLIST
Crag says, "wow."
Crag says, "That's all kinds of wrong.  Is the teacher fixing it?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: OF BULLET POINTED WORDS AND PHRASES
stormagnet [to Crag]: Yeah, she's reviewing it
Crag says, "good"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Stick to your guns!
stormagnet does so!
Crag . o O [ what guns they are! ]

The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room here.
stormagnet and Binder are here.
stormagnet has been getting an excellent education in Writing for Simians
Crag grins.
Crag [to stormagnet]: You could write a book in the Dummies series: Technical Japenese For Dummies
Crag says, "You'd like that, I bet :)"
Crag remembers the brunching.com dummies articles fondly.
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm having a very hard time maintaining a connection on wrack
stormagnet [to Crag]: look nemesis
stormagnet says, "doh"
You see no "nem" here.
Crag [to Binder]: you killed the monkey!
Binder <- bad
stormagnet [to Binder]: WHERE'S MY MONKEY?!
Crag [to stormagnet]: Can you do a traceroute for me?  Or even better, apt-get install mtr-tiny and then
Binder hands stormagnet a Nemesis.
stormagnet cheers!
Binder [to stormagnet]: It doesn't work.
That is not a valid command.
Crag | mtr --report --report-cycles=5
Binder [to stormagnet]: But I started the remake last night before shutdown.
stormagnet ehns
Binder hands stormagnet an Entree container.
Create children of this to have an interactive pet.
Binder hands stormagnet a Container of fruit.
stormagnet laughs!
Crag laughs and laughs
stormagnet cheers!
Binder says, "Someday I will relearn making."
stormagnet has been saved from Bankruptcy by Commissary
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm puTTying
Crag [to stormagnet]: oh, ok.  Just a tracert from the DOS prompt then I guess
stormagnet tries to get a conne4ction from coLinux
stormagnet tries that
stormagnet says, "oooh.... cygwin"
Crag says, "cygwin would be ok"
Crag says, "it won't have mtr, but mtr is just a super-duper traceroute and isn't necessary"
Crag says, "actually!"
Crag says, "I can traceroute you from here, so don't bother"
Crag says, "just hang tight, as they say"
stormagnet hangs with a GRIP OF DEATH!
Crag [to stormagnet]: YOu have a lot of different connections
Crag [to stormagnet]: You're being an untidy user :)
Crag says, "I'll assume the 'screen' one is the one you're using right now"
Crag frowns
Crag [to stormagnet]: You have three inbound SSH connections right now
Crag says, "From three different IPs"
Binder . o O ( hax0rs! )
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm killing the two sshs that claim to just be sitting at a bash prompt
Crag idles: expecting call any second now

Crag [to stormagnet]: sorry
Crag says, "I killed your tf thinking it was rogue"
Crag says, "And now I will quit messing around while I wait for my call"

stormagnet [to Binder]: Actually, I lost it again after THAT
stormagnet [to Binder]: My puTTy connection, rather than my session
Binder [to stormagnet]: Maybe you're in a bad network neighborhood?
Binder . o O ( sketchy )
stormagnet [to Binder]: THe net here is pretty good for everything else
stormagnet doesn't know what's going on
stormagnet [to Binder]: I think those extra ssh sessions are probably from my dropping connection without exiting my session
Crag says, "Ok, I'm off the phone"
Crag [to stormagnet]: The traceroute I did looked clean, and I can't think of why the extra sshes would have interfered
Crag says, "Phone interview was pretty good.  I think I may have been too talkative, but that might just have been a cellphone difficulty or something"
Crag says, "The hiring manager would be getting back to me by a week from Friday if he wants to bring me in for interviews."
stormagnet says, "w00t!"
Crag says, "The guy specifically told me the Linux Sysadmin job market is HOT HOT HOT and that I should set my expectations very high."
Crag says, "Which agrees with that conversation I told you about this morning"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm going to ask DIG for $90k, no matter what happens with the SOC/VRS thing, and if (when) they don't give it to me I'm going to start looking to get it from somewhere else.
Crag says, "Job security is one thing, but I've got to strike this market while it's hot."
Binder [to Crag]: Nice metaphor.
Binder says, "Speaking of metaphors."
Crag smiles.
Binder idles: LUNCH NOIR

Binder can see your house from here!
Crag heh
Binder says, "You are totally the cheapest house on your block.  How'd that happen?"
Crag says, "I don't know"
Binder doesn't -remember- it being on an Indian Burial Ground.
Crag says, "I think it's because we got such a great deal"
Crag says, "So it's under-valued based on that"
Crag says, "It was basically an estate sale"
Crag says, "And we were the first to show up, ready to buy, talked them down $10k"
Binder remembers.
Crag says, "AND I think the estimator who came and looked at the place didn't base his estimate on the house's value"
Crag says, "I think he used whatever Zillow uses"
Crag says, "So the $309k is based on $209 * growth in area"
Crag says, "AND, once we get all the imrovements done I'm sure the place will be worth more than the neighbors' houses."
Crag says, "But maybe I'm biased."
Binder says, "That seems likely."
Binder says, "You'll probably make a killing when the house sells."
Crag says, "That's what I think too."
Crag says, "But also, based on the graphs, it looks like we should hold out quite a bit longer."
Crag says, "The dip in November is probably political since it's nation-wide"
Binder says, "Could be.  Or response to a mortgage effecting federal interest rate change."
Crag says, "Yeah"
Binder reads TPM and goes AHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Binder [to Crag]: Don't worry, you won't find it funny.
Binder [to stormagnet]: And you REALLY won't find it funny.

Binder had leftovers for lunch.

[Idling at 2:19 P.M. on Thu, Feb 9: hunting and gathering]
Binder stares at Python.
Binder . o O ( #$^&#%$^ )
Binder [to Crag]: There is literally nothing like CPAN for Python.
Binder [to Crag]: The closest thing they have is called PackageMan.
Binder [to Crag]: It's in beta.
Binder [to Crag]: And only works on...
Binder [to Crag]: [waaaaaait for it]
Binder [to Crag]: OS X!
Binder [to Crag]: Surprised?  I was!
Binder says, "So I needed to talk to postgres with python."
Binder says, "Or, rather, a script my grand-boss had written depended upon a particular module to do that."
Binder says, "That module is not part of python base."
Binder says, "OK, so I look through the oBSD ports.  No dice."
Binder says, "I search online."
Binder says, "The home site for the module has gone 404."
Binder says, "[Additionally, when trying to serve a custom ErrorDocument, Apache encountered another 404, SIG_YOU_SUCK!]"
Binder says, "So I ask my grandboss [the local Python guru] how I should resolve it."
Binder says, "He tells me where the source is in his home dir on another machine."
Binder says, "So I move it over, and it turns out that it's something like a Perl module to build and install it."
Binder says, "Only without the test suite, or pretty glue code [qv, a Makefile to do the right thing]."
Binder says, "There is a moral equivalent in oBSD, but it's already been EOL'ed by the developers and I didn't really feel like rewriting the gboss's script to use the new interface."
Binder says, "But the happy ending is that I was able to build it at all, thus getting the script functional thus completing the nagios install thus being able to complete a freaking RT ticket."
Binder says, "FINALLY."
Binder spends all his work time trying to resolve a ticket, any ticket.

Crag says, "If it had been something more obscure than postgres you were trying to talk to, I might have been more forgiving... but no.  Postgres should be easy to talk to, and every language/system worth looking at should talk to it."
stormagnet is down with the SOV
Crag [to stormagnet]: I bought the new ladder and am headed up to the roof to clean the gutters.
Crag [to stormagnet]: So if you want to stay at school late to study or whatever, that will probably work well for me.  But don't stay late on my account either.
Crag says, "I'm just letting you know my situation, yadda yadda yadda"
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm pretty flexible
stormagnet [to Crag]: I can hang out and study all the way up until we head over to O'Shea's
stormagnet has NO END of studying to do
stormagnet says, "NONE"
stormagnet [to Crag]: I was already thinking that it would be a) a huge unfair hassle for you and b) a waste of gas for you to pick me up so that we could hang out at home for a couple hours before driving back down here, and then back again
stormagnet [to Crag]: The prof. didn't mitigate my previous exam results for me at all
stormagnet [to Crag]: And, based on her reasons for it, I am officially lumping her in with the Insane Bulgarian
stormagnet hates talking down to people
stormagnet HATES it
stormagnet hates it more when they are so dense that they WANT her to talk down to them
Crag [to stormagnet]: Woah, slow down there, space woman.  You're going to have to break it down into simple terms this earth man can understand.
stormagnet [to Crag]: EXACTLY
Crag says, "ok, I'm really cleaning the gutters now :)"
Crag idles: but you can call me if you want
[Idling at 2:36 P.M. on Fri, Feb 10: but you can call me if you want]
stormagnet [to Crag]: I think that Confucionism was very important in the Tokugawa Period. I think it was important because it told people what kind of people they had to be. This was very important. I do not like Confucianism, because it is mean. The End.
stormagnet is seriously tempted to start wring The End at the end of her papers.
Crag giggles
Crag [to stormagnet]: I cleaned the gutters.  The End.
Crag says, "Nowait..."
Crag says, "I would be remiss in my duties as a smarty pants if I were to merely state that I 'cleaned the gutters'."
Crag says, "What I did was an Act Of War."
Crag says, "I fought terrorism in Gutter Town"
Crag says, "I laid waste to vast swathes of what was on the verge of becoming civilization"
Crag says, "First the things in the gutters ignored me, then they laughed at me, then they fought me, then they landed on the ground or went down the drains"
Crag says, "I may even have uttered the phrase: There's a new sheriff in Gutter Town."
Crag says, "But that might just be because I've been playing too much Gun"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "The gutters are cleaner"
Crag says, "I say cleaner, rather than clean, because I simply do not have the patience to pluck out every last twig and sprig of pinetree crap"
Crag says, "But next time we spend a lot of money on the house, I want modernized gutters which are less vulnerable to the kind of crap we get a lot of."
Crag says, "Oh, and those gutter screens we had were fine for keeping long twigs and small branches out of the gutters"
Crag says, "But they also made a great scaffold for plants to build on."
Crag says, "I was able to clean the north gutters faster than the south gutters because the north gutters had SOLID CLUMPS in them which came out all at once."
Crag says, "Where as I had cleaned the south gutters last fall, so they just had mini pine cones and such in them which did NOT want to flush."
Crag says, "I ended up flossing the south gutters with the hose.  That is, I used the hose as a snake, pushing it down the gutter, then pulling it back, with water pouring out of the end the whole time."
Crag chuckles, "good times... good times."
Crag confuses
Crag says, "I just closed my Firefox, the window is gone, and now I'm watching the process GROW"
Crag says, "It was at 120M of memory usage when I closed it and now it's up to 146 and climbing"
Crag says, "oh, now it's gone"
Crag says, "bleah, I blame windows"
stormagnet [to Crag]: MY HERO!
stormagnet [to Crag]: I definitely agree re: updated gutters
stormagnet [to Crag]: That is On the List
stormagnet [to Crag]: Now that Eri-san cut down all those trees, we shouldn't end up with so much pine crap in them now, too
stormagnet says, "Oh CRAP"
stormagnet just realized that she did the WRONG HOMEWORK
stormagnet spent a TON of time on it, too
stormagnet says, "godDAMMIT"
stormagnet headdesks
stormagnet says, "well, at least it was good practice"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm just playing Gun right now, so if you want to hang out with me in the U dist, gimme a call any time.
stormagnet [to Crag]: that sounds awesome
stormagnet calls
Binder calls, too.

NAME
       Test::Tutorial - A tutorial about writing really basic tests

DESCRIPTION
       AHHHHHHH!!!!  NOT TESTING!  Anything but testing!  Beat me,
       whip me, send me to Detroit, but don't make me write tests!

       *sob*

       Besides, I don't know how to write the damned things.

       Is this you?  Is writing tests right up there with writing
       documentation and having your fingernails pulled out?  Did
       you open up a test and read

           ######## We start with some black magic

       and decide that's quite enough for you?

       It's ok.  That's all gone now.  We've done all the black
       magic for you.  And here are the tricks...
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Crag heh
Binder heh.
Crag says, "I decided it was time to get serious about testing before coding in BEM"
Binder says, "Hard core."
Crag grins
Crag mmm, hard core cider...
Crag [to Binder]: Guiness bottles a cider called Magners (I think?) which is delicious
Crag says, "Not as sharp as Hard Core, and somewhat sweeter."
Crag says, "VERY apply"
Crag says, "apple-y?"
Crag says, "applie?"
Crag says, "applesq?"
Crag says, "apple-esq?"
Crag says, "I hate english"
Ryan says, "brb"

Binder [to Crag]: Your anglo-rage has driven him away.
Crag shrugs
Crag says, "Ryan seems to be of the old school 'log in and idle' variety"
Binder should shower and leave for codecon.
Crag says, "I'll say!"
Crag says, "or whatever"
Binder says, "That's all that goes on on Pegasus."
Binder says, "Sad."
Crag says, "Heh 'Pegasus'"
Binder says, "They all sit in the Village Center."
Crag plplpltt
Binder says, "For days."
Crag says, "MUD DEATH"
Binder says, "When I'm bored, I kill the nonwizzes."
Binder says, "And sweep the room which sends all nonconnected home."
Binder says, "So that they at least have to walk back there the next time they connect."
Crag heh
Ryan has connected.
Crag announces, "Ladies and gentlman, Ryan".  The audience claps politely.
Ryan waves.
Crag grins.
Ryan says, "just upgraded to a more recent version of GnoeMoe"
Ryan says, "a not-too-bad MOO client for Gnome"
Ryan heads off to the Note Editor.
Ryan comes back from the Note Editor.
Crag says, "Interesting."
Crag [to Ryan]: How would you compare it to TinyFugue?
Ryan says, "i was never much of a fan of tf"
Crag stares, aghast.
Ryan says, "I used mud/moo.el, etc."
Crag says, "My TinyFugue gets 40 rods to the hogs head and that's the way I likes it."
Ryan has simple needs: connect to multiple places, activity notification, and local editing
Ryan says, "this one does syntax highlighting, etc."
Crag nods.
Ryan says, "oh, hrm, at least i thought it did"
Crag says, "there's only so much one can do with a M* client."
Ryan says, "there's lots that could be done if MOO had a richer protocol"
Crag says, "You mean like MCP?"
Ryan says, "drag & drop objects, right click to get verbs, etc."
Crag says, "bleah"
Ryan shrugs.
Crag says, "visual interfaces drive me nuts"
Crag says, "Now, tab-completion would be something else!"
Ryan says, "tkmoo has that"
Ryan says, "sorta"
Ryan says, "there's various MCP extensions to do it, anyways"
Ryan says, "tab complete objects"
Crag says, "@list objprevix<tab>:verbprevix<tab>"
Ryan nods.
Crag says, "cool"
Ryan says, "that would be nice"
Ryan says, "dont' think tkmoo can do that one.  it's more people in the room, etc."
Crag says, "ah"
Crag says, "I'm sure it's just a 'simple matter of programming', though"
Ryan says, "moo community has atrophied since like 1994"
Ryan says, "nothing new done"
Ryan says, "i mean, the odd neat thing, but"
Ryan says, "overall, none of the hard stuff gets done"
Ryan should just get his ass in gear and write a moo-like clone in haskell or something
Ryan says, "that would be neat.  use the STM stuff in haskell to get transactions"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Haskell"
Crag says, "I can't think about Haskell without laughing.  My wife had to learn it in her computer science classes at Evergreen and it was an adventure in The Wrong Tool For The Job"
Ryan says, "it is quite brilliant"
Crag says, "I wouldn't recommend it for teaching programming"
Ryan says, "no, i'd have started them with Ocaml"
Ryan says, "or scheme, maybe"
Crag says, "Yes, scheme would be better"
Ryan says, "but type system knowledge is useful"
Crag says, "though as a tradtionalist I would be tempted to start students with C or Pascal"
Ryan says, "i'd maybe start with scheme first half of the semester, then move on to a standard ML or Ocaml in the 2nd half"
Crag says, "I think type systems should come much later when the student has motivation for the hassle"
Ryan says, "C and Pascal have type systems.  just really shitty ones"
Crag says, "Yes, but they're not as... annoying"
Crag says, "TO me at least"
Ryan says, "in the case of C... fuck, i hope i never have to write a line in it again"
Ryan says, "it's fucking crpa"
Crag says, "I love C :)"
Ryan says, "it's garbage"
Crag says, "I don't think so"
Ryan says, "might as well use assembler"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "That's my point"
Ryan says, "that i can see the point in"
Crag says, "I was going to say it's fancy assembler"
Ryan says, "C, I do not"
Ryan says, "it's not an app dev language, anyways, it's not even good for systems programming.  it's good as a kind of [semi]portable assembly language"
Crag says, "yes, I don't write applications, so that's fine"
Crag says, "that whole 'gui' thing"
Ryan says, "C-- is more interesting.  take C and strip it down even more, make it a target language for compilation"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "What I love about MUDs is that they boil complex interactions back down into text again"
Ryan says, "What is the use of C except for low-level programming?  It's got garbage string management facilities, no library of decent data structures"
Crag says, "What I hate about GUIs is that they take simple operations and complicate them"
Ryan says, "doing any text/string stuff in C is a waste of time -- creates insecure code"
Crag says, "It doesn't have to"
Ryan says, "null terminated strings, 8-bit characters"
Crag says, "You don't have to use native strings"
Ryan says, "no type safety at all"
Ryan says, "no, you don't, but then why use C?"
Crag ..
Crag says, "freedom!"
Ryan grins.
Ryan says, "but yeah, haskell is an odd language to teach as a beginning programming course"
Crag says, "I'll admit that C is impossible to apply testing methodologies to"
Ryan says, "laziness, type inference, type classes, pattern matching... christ"
Ryan says, "not to mention monads"
Binder waves.
Binder idles: codecon ahoy
Crag [to Binder]: PANTS
Ryan hungry
Crag says, "I didn't understand Haskell when my wife was trying to learn it, and my understanding hasn't improved since"
Ryan says, "the language itself is fairly simple"
Crag says, "It's probably because of dropping out of college and not pursuing any kind of math stuff"
Ryan says, "overtop of it, though... a world of complexity"
Crag says, "I know it's simple, it's just not my way of thinking about things"
Ryan says, "you can do some amazing stuff with it though because it's so freeform"
Crag says, "Yes, that's pretty much true for any functional language"
Crag says, "I tried to get into Lisp a year ago, and failed that too"
Crag says, "I get the philosophy"
Crag says, "I just don't like it"
Ryan says, "everytime i sit down with lisp i have no problem picking it up.  i just get distracted trying to get anything done"
Ryan says, "and i find it visually annoying"
Ryan says, "i found ml easier to work with"
Crag nods.
Ryan says, "just wish the neat stuff for haskell (type classes and the neat libraries for doing STM) were present in Ocaml"
Ryan says, "Alice ML is pretty slick tho"
Crag says, "I'm sure I'll get into the ivory-tower side of programming some day, but for now I'm going to remain a curmudgeon."
Crag [to Ryan]: You must loath perl
Crag grins.
Ryan says, "i had to work in 100% perl full time for a year"
Ryan says, "I hate it so bad"
Crag says, "It's my favorite right now."
Ryan says, "I really hate the line noise"
Ryan says, "the retarded way of treating variables"
Crag says, "I like that things Just Work"
Ryan found they mostly just broke
Crag says, "I haven't had that problem in years"
Crag says, "But I won't claim it makes sense"
Crag says, "Perl really is a lot like English"
Crag says, "So it can be just as Right or Wrong"
Crag says, "But I love the flexibility"
Crag says, "If Java is Legos, Perl is lumpy clay :)"
Ryan says, "something like perl is fine for solo programming"
Ryan says, "but the moment you have a group of people, it turns to chaos :-)"
Crag says, "I don't think that has to be the case"
Crag says, "I also don't think the language should be a factor"
Ryan says, "requires extreme discipline that the language won't enforce"
Crag says, "I don't think the language SHOULD enforce that discipline"
Ryan does.
Crag says, "That's what programmer tests are for"
Ryan says, "the compiler is a test"
Crag says, "No, the compiler is a translator"
Ryan says, "for you maybe :-)"
Crag says, "Living up to the advertised API is the test"
Ryan says, "the compiler proves the proofs that the type system declares"
Crag says, "But that's not necessary"
Ryan says, "the types in your program are a set of propositions"
Crag says, "And it's not solving the problem"
Ryan says, "not necessary, but neither is driving in the dark with your headlights on"
Crag says, "You're taking the math-centric approach, and that's where funcional programming loses me"
Ryan says, "it definitely solves the majority of problems"
Ryan says, "it can't write your business logic or check it, but it can check that you won't get nulls or type conflicts or various other runtime errors"
Ryan says, "the more expressive the type system, the more static checks can be done _for_ you"
Ryan says, "i've never seen a company with more than 80% test coverage, btw, and that's a _high_ stat"
Ryan shrugs.  "biases :-)"
Crag says, "You don't HAVE to test everything, just enough"
Crag says, "I've been reading Extreme Programming Explained, in case you couldn't tell"
Ryan says, "Yeah I've worked in a couple of XP shops"
Ryan says, "I can't say i fully appreciate the kool-aid."
Crag says, "I would have guessed not"
Crag says, "I haven't yet participated in an XP project but I definitely want to"
Crag says, "It Makes Sense to me"
Crag says, "To me the reality doesn't matter, only the perception"
Crag says, "Tests define how things should look from the outside"
Crag says, "The implementation is irrelevant"
Crag says, "Type-obsessed languages and methodologies interfere with that philosophy"
Crag says, "Why do I care if '0' is a number or a string?  All that matters is that when I print it it's rendered as an ascii zero, and if I add one to it the result behaves like the object I call 'one'"
Crag says, "I can certainly do all that with type-nazi semantics, but why not just let things be whatever they appear to need to be right now?"
Crag says, "It doesn't make my life easier to have to be explicit"
Crag says, "because the mistakes I make are not "oh yeah, I meant string, not int""
Crag says, "My objections to GUI metaphores are similiar"
Crag says, "When I want to move some files around, I don't want to have to point at them, I'd prefer to just describe them"
Crag says, "When I want to associate two objects, I don't want to drag a line between them, I just want to describe the relationship."
Crag says, "anyway, I'm just rambling now"
Crag says, "The elitist programming languages are excellent tools for proving things or doing certain kinds of very powerful constructs, but they are neither inferior nor superior to other languages on the basis of their strictness, syntax or math-oriented design"
Crag says, "Perl is an excellent tool for many things either, and is in no way superior or inferior to its competitors on the basis of its features and design alone"
Crag says, "It takes a particular context or problem for a solution to that problem to have a relative value with respect to another solution."
Crag says, "And for the problems I am interested in, Perl "makes the hard things easy and makes the impossible things possible"."
Crag says, "And Haskell makes me wonder why I have to tell the compiler things it could figure out on its own."
Crag bleah

Binder is online from codecon.
Binder goes whee!
Binder is blown away by http://www.codecon.org/2006/program.html#delta presentation.
Binder points at http://delta.tigris.org/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing
Binder burps.
Binder sees one of the con presenters and a con organizer making out.
Binder says, "CodeCon, come for the licensing, stay for the make outs."
Binder pokes Crag.
Binder [to Crag]: David Barrett.
Binder [to Crag]: http://www.quinthar.com/
Binder [to Crag]: He's giving a presentation on iGlance.
Binder [to Crag]: He has similar code aesthetics to you.
Binder [to Crag]: Including having implemented a wiki [qwikiwiki] and thereby deciding that all wikis are wrong and not useful.
Binder [to Crag]: So he's hoping to add some sort of text collaboration into iGlance which will address the sought featureset of wikis in a way which is more WYSIWYG.
Binder says, "Hey, Brad Templeton is here."
Binder says, "He asked a good question yesterday during the localhost demo but I didn't recognize the name, at the time."
Binder idles: offline to save battery for BART coding.
Crag [to Binder]: You appear to be a machine for turning DisturbingFoodCombinations into InterestingURLs
Crag says, "I had to gather all those links into a bookmark folder for later investigation.  I checked them all out and couldn't reject any of them as not interesting enough to spend lots of time processing."
You hear a quiet popping sound; Ryan has disconnected.
< Ryan has disconnected.  Total: 4 >
Crag creates pr0nlag by uploading music to work
Crag says, "but since you're all idle anyway, I'm sure I'm the only one who cares."
Binder cares.
Binder just cares ... idly.
Crag heh
Crag says, "And laggily"
Crag says, "Never underestimate the importance of The Right Medication"
Crag says, "I'm feeling much better today now that I'm back on Adderall"
Crag says, "I may post in Drugs> about it later"
Binder says, "The right tool for the right job."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag mmm, Tool.
Binder says, "If I could have been sure you'd be as interested in the URL content as I hoped you'd be, I'd have just sent them to you via delicious's for: facility."
Crag says, "I wonder what the boys from Tool are up to these days."
Crag says, "Heh, song on the radio with the line: isn't it a pitty when irish girls grow up"
Binder . o O ( quite )
Crag says, "Apparently they have another album on the way.  Yay."
Crag says, "20 minutes of lag left"
Binder can hardly wait!
Binder will spend 15 minutes of it doing his daily exercise
Binder idles: coffee can't come fast enough
Binder pings.
Crag pongs.
Binder says, "A presentation on ... Friday?  Yeah, Friday.  TRUMAN.  It includes, among other things, a fauxircclient which works by doing a [distaff in time] MitM on a zombie malware and replaying its sends onto an IRC channel and then sits there PONGing the ircd but otherwise sending nothing but capturing everything."
Binder says, "Evidently it's a descendent of what honeynet uses for zombiemaster investigations."
Crag blinks.
Crag says, "distaff in time?  What does that mean?"
Binder says, "Hey, that's a good one.  I meant to type distant."
Crag says, "Oh, ok."
Crag says, "Was it named after the Truman show?"
Binder says, "I attribute that thinko to having read a LOT of WisCon panel descriptions last night."
Crag heh
Binder says, "Possibly, though it didn't come up.  I could just as well have been Harry S Truman."
Binder says, "You know WisCon?"
Crag says, "I do not."
Binder says, "It's a [the?] feminist sf con."
Crag says, "Ahh..."
Binder says, "Memorial Day Weekend in Madison, WI."
Crag says, "Sounds hot :)"
Binder says, "I'll let you know Memorial Day Weekend or shortly thereafter."
Binder says, "Depending upon how fortunate I am at finding net access."
Binder says, "Last year, many of the people Vy had gone to Clarion West with went to it."
Binder says, "And spent a lot of time afterwards talking about how awesome it was."
Binder says, "Which didn't help Vy feel any better about us not being able to afford it."
Binder says, "So this year we set money aside for it explicitly."
Binder hopes it will live up to her expectations.
Binder is a big believer in underexpect, overenjoy.
Crag heh
Crag says, "That's excellent"
Crag says, "You and Vy are clearly taking on sickeningly adorable couple traits.  I commend you, sir."
Binder grins.
Binder says, "Oh, hey, did I mention the making out I saw yesterday?"
Crag says, "I don't believe you did"
Binder says, "OK, I saw a presenter making out with one of the con organizers."
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "Collusion!"
Binder says, "I wouldn't have known she was a presenter except I got a sneak preview of her presentation last Wednesday at SF PostgreSQL UG."
Binder says, "But wait!"
Binder says, "There's more!"
Crag waits for it...
Binder says, "So I'm thinking:  wow, a hook up at a geek con between the ONLY girl presenter and a con co-organizer."
Binder says, "Truly, Rank Hath Its Privileges."
Binder says, "Then she gave her presentation last yesterday."
Binder says, "And it was even more interesting when I saw the whole thing and her demo actually worked."
Binder says, "(So it was good she got the kinks worked out of it on Wednesday.)"
Crag says, "So to speak"
Crag heh
Binder says, "And then, as is the habit, they took questions at the end of the presentation."
Binder says, "People queue up, ask good questions, she answers,blahblahblah."
Binder says, "Then the con organizer gets up and takes the mic, which he's done at the end to wrap up each presentation, call for final questions, thank the speaker, blahblahblah."
Binder says, "so he calls for final questions."
Binder says, "Then he turns to the stage."
Binder says, "And he says:"
Binder says, "I have a question, actually."
Binder says, "It's not really about your presentation."
Binder says, "But sort of tangential to it."
Binder says, "I remember, last year, when you first came to CodeCon."
Binder says, "And you gave a presentation on bioinformatics."
Crag says, "I think I know what's coming"
Binder says, "It was the first time I saw that field as interesting."
Binder says, "And I remember how impressed I was."
Binder says, "And then we've seen each other off and on since then."
Binder says, "And it was during your Christmas break when we visited your family that I knew I wanted this to be more permanent."
Binder says, "So my question is..."
Binder says, "... will you marry me?"
Binder thought three things in rapid succession:
Crag says, "What did she say!"
Binder . o O ( oh, come ON, like anyone could say NO with a whole audience watching! )
Binder . o O ( Truly, Rank DOES Have Its Privileges )
Binder . o O ( i wonder if she'll get to wear the leather pants, now? )
Binder [to Crag]: She said yes.  There was applause and laughter from the audience.
Binder says, "They kissed and his voice went up an octave as he told everyone to head over to the benefit party for community colo fund raising and they'd join them there because they had a lot of beer to drink."
Crag says, "yay!"

Confucious     Heavens                       2 days                            

Total: 4 people, 2 of whom have been active recently.
Binder says, "So evidently, not only is she a C coder, postgresql hacker, bioinformatics genius, tattooed girl geek, she can also kiss the puberty right out of a guy."
Crag says, "damn"
Crag says, "that's so awesome"
Binder says, "I wonder what they can do today at the con to surpass it..."
Binder grins.
Binder says, "Vy asked me yesterday how many girls were at this con."
Binder says, "I took a quick headcount."
Binder says, "Out of roughly 77 people I could see, seven were girls."
Binder says, "But that means that the girl coders were even lower in percentage than the boy coders, because at least some of those females were family/so of boys there and some more work for No Starch Press, who has a table there."
Binder says, "Though it's possible some noncoder boys showed up for ... some reason."
Binder says, "To meet cute geek boys, maybe."
Binder . o O ( but they paid $65 for the privilege so maybe they should have majored in economics. )
Binder says, "Gender disparity among the self-selecting set of people at this con is huge but maybe all the female coders are too busy hacking to come to a con."
Crag says, "that sounds about like what I'd expect"
Binder says, "You know about CoralCDN?"
Crag says, "I think I've heard of it"
Binder says, "OK, short summary:  free volunteer akamai."
Binder says, "So the guy who thought up Coral-Content-Distribution-Network gave a presentation yesterday."
Binder says, "About his new project, OASIS."
Binder says, "OASIS does for any service what CoralCDN does for web content."
Crag says, "Sounds like BEM :)"
Crag says, "Or a subset of BEM, anyway"
Binder says, "He created OASIS because after he rolled out CoralCDN two years ago, and it was being used by hundreds of thousands of users for terabytes of data, he realized he didn't like it."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "So he reinvented his own wheel."
Binder says, "That's how hardcore he is."
Crag says, "It's an epidemic!"
Binder says, "Boring speaker, but his projects are neat."
Binder says, "Electric sheep uses CoralCDN to distribute the sheep."
Binder says, "So that's one place you might have seen it [that's how I knew of it]."
Binder feeds the project URL to Crag via del.icio.us.
Binder [to Crag]: One of the more interesting aspects of this project is that he's done it on PlanetLab.
Binder [to Crag]: Which is a consortium of about five hundred servers owned and maintained by about one hundred entities, mostly academic and corporate R&D.
Binder [to Crag]: And they're doing the actual applied exploration of grid computing.
Binder [to Crag]: So they're doing on a large scale [world wide] what you're doing with BEM [on a single platform].
Crag says, "Interesting"
Binder [to Crag]: So you may want to check out their scalability solutions.
Crag says, "Yeah, totally"
Crag says, "It sounds like they're trying to solve some of my favorite problems"
Crag says, "And taking a sufficiently long view as well"
Crag says, "Thanks for the tip"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "I'm really finding one of the Maker sayings applicable to my life these days."
Binder says, "Don't buy what you can make, don't make what you can find."
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "I've got to put that in my BEM notes"
Binder [to Crag]: Unsolicited tech opinion:  I rather like the Dell Latitude D610's ability to hold multiple batteries.  They've got two batteries in the same [hot?] swappable form factor as the DVD drive.
Binder says, "Probably other machines from Dell and others do this."
Binder says, "But I'd never seen it before."
Binder says, "And I like it quite a bit."
Crag says, "Yes"
Binder says, "2.6.12 acpi recognizes two distinct batteries and shunts power to/from the right place."
Crag says, "The laptops I've seen have bays which can hold either batteries or removable media drives, such as CD and floppy."
Crag says, "That's pretty cool"
Binder says, "So if I were a hard core traveller, I could probably have a bandolier of charged batteries."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "And just swap them in as one ran down."
Crag says, "And they would double as a bulletproof vest"
Binder says, "Aside from their explosive nature upon impact."
Binder says, "Ablative armor!"
Binder tries to remember the last three laptops he's used.
Binder says, "Powerbook G4 12", Compaq somethingsomething, Toshiba somethingsomething, and a Sony Vaio somethingsomething."
Binder says, "None of them had that."
Crag's loathing of perforce grows by leaps and bounds.
Binder covers his ears.
Crag heh
Binder says, "My grandboss loves perforce."
Binder says, "Though if I could find a way to make svn less visible to him, I could probably do a swap in place."
Binder says, "Or, hey, maybe monotone."
Binder says, "There's a presentation today about monotone."
Binder says, "And some people from Vesta are at the con."
Binder overheard a delightful anecdote.
Binder says, "Someone spent three months trying to create a really clever three way merge algorithm."
Binder says, "They looked into patenting it because, hey, they're a company [Vesta, that is]."
Binder says, "They did some prior art research."
Binder says, "The algorithm was a reacreation of something SCCS had."
Binder says, "In 1976."
Binder says, "Wah wah wah WAAAAAAAAH."
Crag giggles.
Binder . o O ( those who do not read musty whitepapers are doomed to reinvent wheels badly. )
Binder says, "Which drove home to me, yet again, the relevancy of the Maker credo to codwork."
Crag says, "Totally"
Binder has vowed to always, always, look for existing stuff before rolling his own.
Binder idles: codecommuting
Binder goes w00.
Binder says, "Sparky showed up here today at CodeCon."
Crag says, "Sparky?"
Binder says, "Sparky@junkBBS."
Binder says, "JDD."
Binder continues to plug away at his Weekly Review by processing his email inbox.
Binder says, "I prefer to do it one uninterrupted go but this con ate my weekend."
Crag says, "Ah"
Binder says, "Woohoo!"
Crag heh
Binder says, "Len just announced codecon will be cheaper next year."
Crag says, "nice"
Binder [to Crag]: You have no excuse for not coming.
Crag says, "You might be right"
Binder hums.
Binder says, "The dido demo was interesting despite its complete failure."
Binder says, "That is, he couldn't get festival to stay up for whatever reason, but the project is interesting."
Binder says, "It's a dynamic IVR system in Perl."
Crag says, "What's dido?"
Crag says, "IVR?  Is that like PVR?"
Binder says, "It reacts to choices made by people so that more popular items float to the top."
Binder says, "Customer service phone menu."
Crag says, "Ah!"
Crag says, "Interesting..."
Binder says, "Like when you call someplace and it says:  please listen closely as our menu has changed recently?"
Binder says, "Dido would make that a true statement."
Binder says, "Instead of the lie which it is now."
Binder says, "And because of caller-id, you could tie menu priorities to a particular caller."
Binder LAUGHS.
Binder says, "Brad Templeton poked some great holes in the project with his questions."
Binder says, "Sharp fucking guy."
Crag says, "I like the concept, but the implementation could go horribly wrong"
Crag says, "I guess that's true of anything. :P"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "Templeton's points were succintly summed up by his last observation:  It sounds like you're xmling up the wrong tree!"
Binder says, "ie, is this a problem which needs solved, is this a solution to the actual problems of ivrs, and is this the best solution to the problems which ivrs really have."
Binder says, "But it's neat to see someone doing something interesting with Perl, to me."
Binder switches wireless channels.
Binder really really likes iwlist.
Crag heh
Crag says, "I do think it sounds like a problem which needs a solution"
Crag says, "Phone trees could be way better"
Binder says, "Yes.  ivrs are extremely flawed and annoying."
Crag says, "I don't know about the solutions though"
Binder says, "But having options move dynamically may not solve any of that annoyance."
Crag says, "In some cases it won't"
Crag says, "But if 90% of the calls into a system are about the same thing, putting that as the first option at the top of the tree seems like a Good Thing"
Crag says, "And if the system were to adapt to changing traffic, that seems like it would be good too"
Crag says, "The caller-id thing is icing"
Binder says, "Icing which comes with privacy concerns."
Binder says, "Since caller-id can be spoofed."
Crag says, "ah, good point"
Crag says, "Actually"
Binder says, "Say I call my broker and navigate to the hiding-money-from-tax-men department."
Binder says, "Someone calls and fakes having my phone number."
Crag says, "Would you do that over the phone though?"
Binder says, "Dido tells them what I was asking about most."
Crag says, "Even without Bush's transgressions I'd consider phones highly insecure"
Binder says, "It's not plausible for me but similar scenarios are plausible for anybody."
Binder says, "An ivr at a doctor's office, say."
Crag says, "I see"
Binder says, "So articulating the problem properly is an important step which seems to have not happened."
Binder says, "It seems like Quinn came up with a clever solution and then looked for a problem to hang it on."
Crag heh
Crag says, "You're Not Gonna Need It :)"
Binder says, "That is, he started working with ivrs and was thinking about dynamic menus and the two combined in his head."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Woo, No Starch is buying us lunch today."
Binder says, "Because today started so late, they're bringing in pizza to eat during talks."
Crag says, "That's nice"
Binder sits up as the presenter for Deme starts talking about Oscar Wilde, socialists, and software.
Binder says, "Nice, you'd like this talk."
Binder says, "Group communication must be asynch because of today's fast paced lifestyles in certain places [ie, bay area]."
Binder says, "wiki not great for planning group ACTION."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I would like that talk :)"
Binder says, "The audio should be available thereafter."
Binder says, "Actually, live now."
Binder says, "http://codecon.bittorrent.com/"
Crag says, "I don't think I could listen from work without getting frustrated"
Binder says, "OK."
Binder [to Crag]: I threw you a pertinent link via delicious.
Crag takes a look
Crag |  All binder's items (772)
Crag says, "Good golly!"
Binder [to Crag]: You know about for: ?
Crag does not
Binder [to Crag]: http://del.icio.us/for/crag
Binder [to Crag]: There's also a 'for' link from your delicious page to it.
Binder [to Crag]: Syntax to drop a link in there for another delicious user is for:<name>
Crag says, "I see..."
Binder [to Crag]: Almost everything I mark which I think may interest someone else, I throw some for: tags on.
Crag nods.
Crag . o O ( Binder: The Internet Aggregator/Filterer )
Binder says, "But, yeah, I have a LOT of delicious marks."
Binder needs to [and has a NA to do so] revisit and reorg the marks.
Binder says, "Daaaaamn."
Binder says, "This deme is cool."
Binder goes west.

You are in the western end of the Entrance Hall, by the front desk.  A brown leather couch is next to the desk.  Behind the counter, you can see a door leading into an office behind.

Binder says, "On skis or horses?"
Crag says, "Snowboard, I believe."
Binder . o O ( horses on boards? )
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That would be... wrong."
Binder says, "But funny!"
Crag says, "yes."
Crag says, "Putting animals in human situations is always funny."
Crag says, "groupspace.org appears to be slammed."
Binder says, "Monkeys smoking?  Funny."
Crag says, "Probably because of codecon :P"
Binder says, "Dogs in dresses?  Funny!"
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Probably."
Crag says, "Always"
Crag says, "Cats in sinks!"
Crag says, "ohwait"
Binder says, "Their demo server in here got so slammed I couldn't interact with it."
Binder says, "So it doesn't seem to be ... robust."
Binder says, "But it's ambitious and interesting."
Stop following whom?
Crag no longer follows Binder.

Binder [to Crag]: A questioner just invoked you.
Crag . o O [ ? ]
Binder [to Crag]: Asking if Deme supports Robert's Rules of Order.
Crag heh
Crag's rules of disorder.
Binder . o O ( robert's rules of out of order )
Binder HUN GWY.
Binder . o O ( where's mah free pizzzzzza bishes? )
Binder looks at the monotone install reqs and goes BZUH?!
Binder says, "Fedora has apt-get now?"
Binder . o O ( who let red hat out of dependency hell? )
Crag [to Binder]: ?!
Binder [to Crag]: http://venge.net/monotone/INSTALL
Binder [to Crag]: http://www.fedora.us/wiki/FedoraHOWTO
Binder says, "I guess since FC1."
Crag buh
Binder will be danged.
Crag says, "hot diggity"
Binder . o O ( so why does it still suck? )
Crag says, "I don't care enough about the project to guess"
Crag says, "Although I might start caring if I get a job which has me working with FC and EL more"
Binder nods.
Binder just ate a free slice of pizza.
Binder says, "Thanks, No Starch Press, for the Extra Starchy Lunch!"
Binder has had a hard time resisting the urge to buy a NS book.
Binder says, "But I keep remembering I won't have time to read a non-novel this year and that seems to help some."
Binder says, "Speaking of, I'm going offline to read more of the novel I started today [Speed of Dark]."
Crag heh
Binder goes WHEE.
Binder says, "Monotone looks promising."
Binder goes @@ at Rhizome.
Binder [to Crag]: Dude.
Crag [to Binder]: Hi there
Crag says, "Rhizome sounds like Schism"
Binder [to Crag]: I for:warded you for that reason.
Crag . o O ( and not just because I'm pronouncing it funny )
Crag looking now
Crag | The long-term vision is that each Rhizome site will intertwine together, forming an emergent fuzzy taxonomy over a peer-to-peer network.
Crag . o O ( It's like they can see right into my brain )
Binder grins.
Binder says, "You're on the same wave[length] they're surfing."
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "Now how to take advantage of this..."
Crag hms
Crag says, "I still think BEM is What I Really Want"
Crag says, "But if I hadn't come up with BEM yet, Rhizome would be damn close."
Crag says, "And it's obvious that Rhizome will play nicely with BEM once BEM has services for interacting with things like HTTP and RDF"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Once you can pass data to a node, it doesn't matter if it's a BEM node or a Rhizome node."
Crag says, "pretty much, yeah"
Crag says, "Obviously that's one of the general goals of BEM: to make problems not matter so much anymore."
Crag says, "To turn everything into a SimpleMatterOfProgramming :)"
Binder says, "Programming is easy, thinking is hard."
Crag says, "so true"
Crag says, "yes, Rhizome looks awesome and it's taking a supreme effort on my part not to get side-tracked into it. :)"
Crag says, "When I feel that BEM is more secure in its gestation I will start drawing connections between it and related projects like Rhizome."
Binder grins.
Binder says, "It's in your /for/ folder, you can ignore it until you're ready."
Crag says, "Not only that, I copied it in case you ever tidy up"
Binder does that.
Binder says, "URLs I get via for: [ie, the TWO I've ever gotten] got retagged with from<name> for my own purposes."
Crag says, "good thinking"
Crag says, "I should tag the few URLs I have while there are so few."
Binder says, "Great thing about delicious is that retagging is trivial."
Binder says, "Assuming I'm mouse-comfortable."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "And consolidating my tags.  I can just blank the existing line and click on ones to use."
Crag says, "And if mouse-uncomfortable folks will just have a hard time with everything on the web anyway."
Binder says, "That's pretty true, though firefox has some nice keyboard shortcuts I've learned."
Binder nearly typed that as shortcutes, which looks like a nice malaprop.
Binder . o O ( strawberry shortcutes )
Crag heh

Binder says, "Last presentation is wrapping up."
Binder idles: coding on BART
Binder is home.
Crag is at work.  Again.
Binder . o O ( yay? )
Binder learned something interesting about JavaScript yesterday.
Binder says, "It's one-threaded ... in the same thread as the browser UI."
Binder says, "So that's why doing something via AJAX, say with a really long backpackit list, takes so freaking long."
Binder shuts down this computer in an attempt to make progress towards being at work, himself.
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "I've noticed that some Firefox extensions are based on javascript, so (for example) Sage will generate a "Some javascript is taking its freakin' time" message if it has a lot of feeds to look at or something."
Crag says, "As far as we've come in programming we still have a long way to go"
Crag says, "Things like that remind me of why I'm working on BEM"
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet replies to scroll in place :P
stormagnet [to Binder]: No need to pity, I'll never grow up
stormagnet [to Crag]: And speaking of the right tool for the job
stormagnet [to Crag]: I took some of your Focalin this morning
stormagnet [to Crag]: It had an awesomely funny side effect I hadn't considered
stormagnet [to Crag]: It gave me a way to deal with Ty
stormagnet [to Crag]: Which was to grab one of his talking points out from under him, and start talking about it
stormagnet [to Crag]: AND NOT STOP
stormagnet [to Crag]: For the whole ride, I just held forth, on multiple digressions
stormagnet AWES at proposal
stormagnet figured out the weirdness with her connection, maybe
Crag [to stormagnet]: you are teh awesome
stormagnet says, "The UW is lots of little access points, rather than one big strong one"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "So maybe you keep getting bumped?"
Crag says, "BEM would solve that problem if it existed. :)"
stormagnet says, "I was actually managed to STAY connected to a crappy node, instead of losing connection and reconnecting to a closer, stronger one"
stormagnet [to Binder]: DAMN, do I miss those hot swappable bays
stormagnet [to Binder]: The Inspiron had those
stormagnet [to Binder]: Before it @#%#!! melted
Crag nods and sighs.
Crag says, "I think my HP has them, but I'm not sure."
stormagnet would kind of like an external charger for her lap[top batteries
Crag says, "I'm sure you could get one"
Crag says, "And since we're not going to buy that awesome VW, we can still afford it."
Crag says, "I guess I should mail Dave"
stormagnet skims much interesting scroll in the interests of catching up without blowing her study period entirely
stormagnet did not, in fact, break anything but her PRIDE
stormagnet . o O ( and my knees are turning interesting colors and textures )
Crag [to stormagnet]: you can always review scroll in my logs
stormagnet [to Crag]: BEM is panacea
Crag grins.
stormagnet [to Crag]: actually, I've never been able to find such a thing
Crag blinks.
Crag says, "I'm shocked."
stormagnet [to Crag]: To charge batteries outside the laptop, that is
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Crag]: It's Craaaaazy
stormagnet says, "Okay, this connection is just crap"
Crag heh
Crag hugs stormy through her crap connection.
stormagnet says, "It would appear that my favorite places to plug in have the worst connection"
stormagnet says, "There are two booths that I've found with outlets underneath"
stormagnet says, "There are other outlets, but they are next to little rickity tables, rather than comfy booth benches"
stormagnet says, "But the rickity tables seem to be in an area with better wireless"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "It's probably because I'm sitting next to this brick wall. Or something."
stormagnet is right next to a WINDOW, so you'd think...
Crag says, "Must be a conductive window, shielding you from DEADLY RAYS and stuff"
stormagnet says, "EEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!"
stormagnet [to Crag]: My linguistics class has finally reached the chapter on semantics!
stormagnet is taking her crappy online quiz now
stormagnet says, "FOUR MINUTES"
stormagnet has a NEW RECORD!
Crag grins.
stormagnet WHUGGLES semantics!!
stormagnet says, "The book is starting to get into the part I'm obsessed with"
stormagnet says, "Semantics and Pragmatics"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "And it even gave cognitive psychology a nod"
Crag says, "I demand that you share all your lessons and such with me"
stormagnet squeees all over the place
stormagnet grins
stormagnet shall!
Crag says, "It is critical to the development of BEM, among other things :)"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Just try and stop me
stormagnet is unshutupable
Crag [to stormagnet]: I think I could if I wanted to.
Crag says, "I don't know why I would want to"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Does the Horde's authentication depend on IP?
Crag says, "no"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet [to Crag]: You'd never know until you tried
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag ..
Crag [to stormagnet]: I may have an idea for valentine's day in that case...
stormagnet [to Crag]: So much for my hypothesis on why I keep losing my horde sessions, then
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "Sessions yes"
stormagnet fans herself
Crag says, "Sessions are based on IP"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Crag]: So that's why I keep having to log back in
Crag says, "Actually, that's not even a horde thing"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet figured
Crag says, "Changing IPs will fuck everything up"
stormagnet [to Crag]: I didn't know how much was cookie based
Crag says, "too much"
stormagnet says, "I suppose if it WAS cookie based, it would be horribly insecure"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "Spoofed cookies used to be a big problem"
stormagnet will just have to up with it put
stormagnet nods
stormagnet . o O ( This is precisely the sort of bloody nonsense up with I shall not put )
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "Linguistics cracks me up even without a Woody Allen prof"
stormagnet says, "My sense of humor is very verbal"
stormagnet says, "Okay, lady, seriously"
stormagnet says, "If you have neither a website nor an address for your charitable organization"
Binder . o O ( orally fixated )
stormagnet says, "I am inclined to believe you are just a chick with a jar looking to make some cash"
stormagnet [to Binder]: In-deed
Binder jingles his jars significantly.
stormagnet laughs
Binder is making his peace with his first cup of coffee of the day.
Binder [to coffee]: I don't like you and clearly you don't like me but if you can be of use to me, I will happily promote you into the urinal transit system here.
Binder says, "In three days I forgot how to be at work."
stormagnet says, "whoops, time for class"
Crag [to Binder]: Has your lovely doctor person had anything useful to say about your relationship with coffee?

Crag says, "DAMMIT.  Every time Windows does something right, they do it wrong."
Binder [to Crag]: Dr. Hippiechick?  Well, she thinks I should definitely get more sleep.
Crag says, "They copy tab completion from unix, and then they do it wrong"
Binder [to Crag]: But, uh, that's not feasible.
Crag [to Binder]: yeah
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Because you're so ambitious, or what?"
Crag says, "How much sleep do you get and how much does she think you should get?"
Binder says, "Something like that."
Binder says, "Because I'm so married to a night person."
Crag says, "Hm"
Binder gets <7 hours a night.
Binder says, "Dr. HC says I should get another."
Crag says, "I can appreciate the difficulty there"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Binder says, "It should ease once I've been here long enough that I can come in later."
Binder says, "Right now I'm sticking to an in-by-9 out-after-6 new-guy-good-impression schedule."
Binder says, "Also I have hopes of working from home one day a week starting any week now."
Binder started working his way through diveintopython.
Crag says, "that all sounds smart to me"
Binder says, "It's a tutorial by Mark Pilgrim [qv diveintomark.org] packaged in Debiuntu."
Crag says, "Except the python :)"
Binder says, "Yeah, well, I like to be an informed critic so before I tell my grandboss it's shit and I'm going to rewrite it all, I need to know what I'm talking about."
Crag says, "That makes a lot of sense"
Binder . o O ( which is how i came to know so much about star wars and star trek )
Crag laughs
Binder . o O ( and tolkien )
Binder . o O ( and will probably come to know far too much about harry potter )
Crag says, "On a vaguely related tangent, I figured out my final answer to the idea that a programming language should enforce discipline"
Binder . o O ( is that your final answer? )
Crag says, "Not that I have to convince you, but here's what it is"
Binder [to Crag]: Yesss, as I recall, it's Ryan you're working to convince.
Binder is merely an [innocent] bystander.
Crag says, "yes, but he's not here"
Crag says, "My answer is: if a project has a discipline problem, a strict langauge isn't going to solve the problem."
Crag says, "It's a little like gun control that way"
Crag says, "If people are killing each other, hiding their guns isn't solving the problem."
Crag says, "I'm not saying guns should be readily available, like they are in Perl, just that freedom is not the problem."
Crag says, "anyway, I'll try that argument (maybe without the gun control analogy, heh) on Ryan when he logs in again"
Binder says, "Yes, I think throwing guns into the mix may incite the wrong allegory."
Binder says, "Because people tend to have strong opinions about them."
Binder says, "Which would color the correlated metaphor."
Binder says, "For example, if you use that metaphor, there's a possibility of a stance such as, restricting guns is a valid answer, you give them to the cops and they kill people."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Or you give everyone guns but you make them live[code] further apart from each other."
Binder says, "So they can only kill themselves, not each other."
Crag says, "I need another analogy or whatever"
Binder says, "Type strict languages are, perhaps, like ... weekend detention for unruly brat pack students!"
Binder . o O ( ok, maybe not )
Crag heh
Crag says, "It's not just type strictness, either"
Binder says, "Type strict languages are like not stopping for a piss break while driving cross country."
Crag says, "It's Python's indentation thing"
Binder says, "Syntactical strictness?"
Crag says, "I guess"
Binder says, "Whitespace, type declarations, initialize before use, continuation \ lines..."
Binder says, "That sort of thing?"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "Basically, I shouldn't HAVE to tell the compiler anything it could figure out on its own"
Crag says, "I should be PERMITTED to specify things so that I can be told when there is a conflict"
Binder says, "Like the various pragmas and forms of strict with Perl5."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder can see it both ways.
Crag says, "Really?"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Severe languages do have better disambiguation rules."
Binder says, "Because if it isn't unambiguous, it's illegal."
Binder says, "This is in my foremind because of the cqual++ / elsa / oink / elkhorn presentation."
Crag says, "I can see the point of that"
Binder says, "They are trying to put together a toolset to automatically follow data flow."
Binder says, "To check for datatainting."
Binder says, "And it's hard with C because it's so forgiving."
Crag says, "I suppose I'm ok with requiring clarification when a construct is completely ambigous"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "And it's somewhat easier with C++ because you can write templates to enforce discipline on yourself."
Binder says, "Maybe there's another way to get disambiguation without constraint, I dunno."
Binder hasn't thought about it extensively.
Binder says, "But I did see their points about how hard it is to audit a big piece of C code for subtle problems."
Crag says, "Yeah, C is sortof the worst-case scenario"
Binder says, "You can't just eyeball 250M lines and see the security holes."
Binder says, "Some of them, sure, but not all of them."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "So having a tool to do it for you helps."
Binder says, "But languages with not much rigidity where the compilers make good guesses at what you intend tend to be harder to automate auditing of."
Binder says, "But from the other side, if languages only work when constraining coders, we've just made another class of machines to impose drudgery on humans and that's dumb."
Binder says, "We should get some leisure and fun out of our toys."
Crag heh
Crag says, "Yes"
Binder says, "So, I can see it both ways."
Crag says, "My other thought is that you'd never look at 250k lines of code at once"
Binder stops walking in a circle.
Crag says, "You'd (hopefully) have functional units of ~25 lines of code, less than 78 columns wide"
Binder says, "You might, if you were a kernel hacker."
Binder says, "That just makes it differently hard to spot bugs."
Crag says, "I suppose"
Binder says, "Say, bugs which relate to widely disaparate data manipulations."
Binder says, "It turns out, if you pass data around via pointers, figuring out if a given data in a given address is tainted or not runs into the halting problem."
Crag says, "Yes, I wouldn't defend raw pointers"
Crag says, "But I also wouldn't solve the tainting problem at the C source level"
Crag says, "I'd solve it at a layer above C, via libraries and such"
Crag says, "Or a language like Perl"
Crag says, "I think what's bugging me is this linking of things which need not be linked"
Crag says, "Language semantics is orthogonal to software architechture"
Crag says, "Or maybe I'm being naive"
Binder thinks about it.
Crag says, "But then, that's why I'm designing BEM in language-agnostic ways"
Binder says, "No, I can buy that.  Architecture need not be confined to a particular language or dialect."
Binder says, "Unfortunately, until architecture is expressed in a particular language, it's ideal and useless."
Crag says, "that's true"
Binder says, "So there's probably a weak correlation in that the two levels interact."
Crag says, "I think I've been tainted by MOO and ColdMUD where the server de-compiles code on the fly"
Binder says, "Choosing to write something in Java v. Perl, to pick to common languages you've seen, determines which kinds of architecture are easy v. hard."
Binder s/pick to/pick two/
Crag nods.
Binder says, "So they're not the same thing, but there is a feedback."
Binder says, "And you can loosely couple them but I'm less convinced about entirely decouple."
Binder says, "If your architecture were domain independent, maybe."
Binder says, "Say:  this system of interacting software objects would work fine at the metal level as well as a web service, so it doesn't matter what language I work in other than pinning that implementation into one domain."
Crag nods.
Binder . o O ( in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. )
Crag says, "There are multiple issues here.  One is what kinds of things the languages let us do, the other is the forms we're allowed to express them in."
Crag says, "I think Ryan's point is that the language should limit the expression forms in order to ease colaboration"
Crag says, "That is, if you can't make it look like crap, you can't make it hard for him to edit"
Crag says, "But I think that's a falacy"
Binder says, "So he wants the language to enforce coding standards."
Crag says, "And now work's getting busy so I can't elaborate"
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Which is how XP settles it."
Binder says, "Put together a consensus about how code should look."
Crag says, "yes, that's the solution I favor."
Crag says, "Just decide on a standard and hold your peers to it.  Don't make it part of the language."
Crag says, "It's a little like the ideas behind NewSpeak in 1984"
Crag says, "If you can't say it, it can't happen"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Crag says, "Even if you agree with the intent, the solution is still wrong"
Binder says, "Which is a sort of rebuttal of the Whorf-Sapir Language Hypothesis."
Crag says, "I found it particularlly telling that Ryan claims to have had negative experiences working on XP teams."
Binder says, "Maybe they were AlmostXP teams."
Crag says, "Or maybe Ryan is an ass"
Binder can't rule it out.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "I think going to codecon has given me a broader perspective."
Binder keeps running into situations where he's less interested in taking a side.
Binder says, "More interesting to try to see something from multiple sides."
Crag says, "I may have lost some perspective at some point."
Binder says, "Perspeprosy."
Binder says, "Bits of perspective falling off."
Binder tends to cycle between being adamant and being more flexible.
Binder says, "It's probably pretty normal for me to vacillate."
Crag says, "Sometimes I think I vacillate, but then I'm not so sure."
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag dies from a wound inflicted by Binder with the Leatherman blade.
The Heavens
Well, this is the afterlife.  It's not very interesting.  If only you could live again.  A Happy Angel Food Cake Factory is here.
Confucious is here, off in another world.  GhostOfTheManor is asleep.
The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room here.
Binder is here.  stormagnet is dozing.
Crag has arrived.
Crag says, "nice :)"
Binder grins.

Crag [to stormagnet]: Confucious has been in the heavens for three days.  That is also nice.
Crag says, "Or should I say, that too is nice?"
Crag says, "Or that is nice as well?"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Speaking of overly flexible languages :)"
Crag says, "I wonder if Ryan is the person I knew who was learning esperanto"
Crag shrugs
Binder says, "No one learns esperanto, they just say they're going to learn esperanto."
Crag laughs
Binder takes advantage of his jaw-snapping yawns to pour more coffee into his head tube.
Crag heh
Devil has connected.
Binder needs to complete his weekly review.
Crag [to Devil]: Welcome back
Devil says, "Hello peaches"
Binder says, "Maybe tonight between work and Lawrence of Arabia."
Binder says, "BEND OVER ABIGAIL-MAE, HERE COMES THE GRAVY PIPE."
Crag says, "I never did my WR last week"
Binder says, "Ouch."
Crag says, "yeah, well..."
Binder couldn't fit in a concentrated time block between codecon & wifecon.
Crag says, "I blame the change of medication"
Binder says, "That's my excuse."
Crag says, "I'm back on Adderall this week, so I'm sure I'll be back on track"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "codecon and wifecon are pretty solid excuses."
Binder says, "Maybe if I hadn't stayed so long at sleepcon."
Binder . o O ( sleep less?  GENIUS IDEA! )
Binder pokes Devil.
Binder [to Devil]: You may or may not have some new for: marks.
Binder [to Devil]: Depending upon when you last viewed them.
Binder [to Crag]: In the interest of equal time, some things to like about Python which I have learned of late:  everything is an object.
Binder [to Crag]: It has an immutable list type.
Crag nods.
Binder [to Crag]: It has a single character printf().
Binder [to Crag]: Are those enough to compensate for their utter lack of anything reliable for package management?  Answer hazy, I'll keep working.
Crag says, "I agree that they are good"
Crag says, "I think after BEM's off the ground I will try to come up with my ideal programming language."
Binder . o O ( under god )
Crag says, "I'm embarressed to work in an environment where a three second response time from a web service is considered 'good'"
Binder hands you a Burqa of Shame.
Devil . o O (  oh yeah. For: )
Binder stabs Devil with a TheraSense FreeStyle.  Neat!
Devil stabs Binder with a boney elbow.  Neat!
Devil ducks and stumbles, falling over.
To hide your sins from the world.
That is not a valid command.
Burqa of Shame (aka #1174 and burqa)
Owned by Binder.
To hide your sins from the world.
Obvious verbs:
  g*et/t*ake burqa
  d*rop burqa
  gi*ve/ha*nd burqa to <anything>
Crag's looking much more "emo" than usual.
He is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 an ice pick                             a relationship
 the Working Hard Feature                a Binder's Eyebrow
 a bandages                              a Burqa of Shame
You see no "me Crag looks a little haggared." here.
Description set.
stormagnet pours water over self
stormagnet changes into white robes
stormagnet rolls out mat
stormagnet sets out katana stand
Crag [to stormagnet]: ?
stormagnet stabs stormagnet with a katana.  Neat!
stormagnet pulls to the side
stormagnet stabs stormagnet with a katana.  Neat!
stormagnet dies from a wound inflicted by stormagnet with the katana.
stormagnet has left.
Crag says, "The neat thing about death on the MOO is that there's no mess to clean up"
Crag says, "Oh, and the re-incarnation is good to"
Crag says, "too"
stormagnet arrives from the heavens.
stormagnet says, "THAT'S HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PROF"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Lucky for me that you reincarnate so fast
Crag frowns.
stormagnet [to Crag]: That's because I took the honorable path
Crag heh
stormagnet gives Professor Leila Madge a NtM
Crag [to stormagnet]: Does she need a hard fucking?
Devil  koffs
Crag says, "It's amazing how many problems have such simple solutions."
Binder . o O ( indeed )
Binder [to stormagnet]: That was a lot more interesting pantomime when I read it out of order.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Because it involved a waterlogged white robe.
Crag [to Binder]: I was thinking about that too
Crag grins.
Binder [to Crag]: That's just like you, to take something pure and final and sully it and turn it into some sort of ... prelude.
Binder . o O ( orange you glad i didn't say foreplay )
Crag laughs
Binder looks for something to punch.
Binder is all wound up and unfocused.
Binder says, "Too much caffeine, no weekly review, spent a weekend focused on something not my job."
Binder says, "OpenBSD is weird."
Binder says, "Following -current is requiring me to rebuild gcc."
Binder says, "Twice."
Binder says, "On purpose."
Binder . o O ( what the?! )
Crag heh
Devil says, "I must now recompile the compiler!"
Devil pulls on his bootstraps
Binder says, "Si."
Binder drinks too much caffeine.
Devil [to Binder]: City Center Dental Spa? is that the place Vy goes?
Binder [to Devil]: Yes.
Binder [to Devil]: Me, too.
Binder [to Devil]: But mostly we go there because of her dental woes and their pampering.
Binder [to Devil]: They are nice.
Binder breaks out his lance and saddles up his horse and sets out to do battle with Windmill Cerebus.
Devil [to Binder]: good good. R's got an appointment there and i'm trying to convince L she should get a damn cleaning
Binder [to Devil]: She should.
Binder [to Devil]: They'll give her a neck warming wrap and a hand massage.
Devil [to Binder]: that sounds pretty nice
Binder [to Devil]: It is.  They're pamper-iffic.
Binder decides to just close the IM window from Cerebus and drop it.
Binder . o O ( fucking slashdot )
Devil [to Binder]: slash dot dash dot dash dot com
Crag says, "I'd go to a dentist like that"
Crag says, "Oh, hand MASSAGE"
Crag says, "I mis-read that."
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder [to Crag]: Make sense, damn you.
Crag [to Binder]: does not computer
Binder stares at openBSD's majordomo web interface.
Crag [to stormagnet]: release candidate three of another Horde version announced today.
Binder . o O ( now with security )
Crag [to Binder]: heh
Binder <- dreaming
Binder returns from total system freeze.
Binder hehs.
Binder wondered how long that would take.
Binder says, "Make just posted an emergency email to their subscribers."
Binder says, "Latest issue has an error in diagram."
Binder says, "If you adhere to it, you could short circuit your wall power outlet."
Binder . o O ( ZOT! )
Crag!
Crag says, "That's kinda scary."
Crag says, "I guess anyone reading Make ought to be prepared for that sort of thing."
Binder says, "Yeah, but it doesn't matter how many times they print disclaimers, someone's going to sue them."
Crag says, "naturally"
Binder says, "People love lawsuits the same way they love lottery tickets."
Binder says, "OOH, it's my chance to WIN free MONEY."
Crag nods and sighs.
Binder goes woo.
Crag [to Binder]: ..
Binder got wpa_supplicant working for office wifi.
Crag says, "What's wpa_supplicant?"
Binder says, "WPA is the next weakest security after WEP."
Binder says, "Wait, did I say that right?"
Binder says, "Next strongest."
Binder says, "Next almost as broken."
Binder says, "So nothing < WEP < WPA < a secure wireless protocol"
Binder says, "wpa_supplicant is a daemon which brokers a wpa connect."
Crag says, "ah"
Crag [to Binder]: Why hasn't Eda posted anything to SeattleHuskies.com in two years?
Binder [to Crag]: She's started a series of sites since then and probably no longer remembers having SH.com
Binder [to Crag]: I believe she's currently active at pokingmyeyesout.com.
Binder [to Crag]: You should send her harassing email telling her to give you more puppy pictures to look at.
Binder is quite sure she hasn't stopped taking them.
Crag Hm
Crag says, "Perhaps I shall"
Crag says, "Perhaps I will also mention the renewed activity on the MOO"
Crag . o O ( if we can call it that )
Crag [to stormagnet]: Accuweather hates me
Binder humps Crag's leg.
Crag [to Binder]: ..
Crag says, "JaysHouseMOO had a dog"
Crag says, "The MOO dog was based on a real dog named Abby"
Crag says, "it was a fun toy"
Crag says, "Abby would fetch... anything that wasn't locked down, including people"
Crag says, "Someone could tell abby to go get some other player and Abby would run to the other side of the MOO and bark at the player until they 'follow abby' and then abby would go back to the other person."
Crag says, "good stuff"
Binder says, "Neat."
Binder says, "PG wanted me to build pets for her."
Binder says, "And I started it."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "But.  You know.  Stuff."
Crag says, "I know"
stormagnet [to Crag]: let me know when you leave work
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'll head over to the HUB then
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet has crap cell reception, so MOO is best
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "I was planning on staying 'till 6, possibly later, depending on how things are going"
Crag [to stormagnet]: does that work ok for you?
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "great."
stormagnet will be studying wherever she is
Crag grins.
Binder says, "Like Pigpen's cloud of dust, stormie has a cloud of studions around her."
Crag [to Binder]: I've been reading a physics book these past few days
Crag says, "modern physics is... troubling."
Crag says, "This business about the Higgs field..."
Crag says, "and the shape of the universe"
Crag says, "ugh"
Crag says, "These physicists must be stopped! :)"
Binder says, "GIVE US BACK OUR SIMPLISTIC MODELS WHICH DIDN'T SCARE US."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "I'll concede relativity, just on the basis that the symetry works out nicely"
Crag says, "But I am not comfortable with the pantheon of sub-atomic particles."
Crag says, "The bosons and leptons and all that.  CHarm, color, spin."
Crag says, "ANd tunneling!"
Crag says, "What is this tunneling business!"
Crag says, "There has to be a better explination than QED"
Crag says, "I think QED is some kind of plot to extract science funds out of honest americans!  (Dishonest americans don't pay taxes :)"
Binder doesn't?
Binder says, "why didn't somebody tell me?"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Maybe not ALL dishonest americans don't pay taxes"
Binder grabs his W-2 back from the HR lady and writes "EXEMPT because DISHONEST" on it.
Crag says, "But that's not what I'm on my soapbox about"
Binder [to Crag]: l soapbox
Crag says, "I'm not even sure how I feel about Maxwell's equations."
Binder [to Crag]: You see no "soapbox" here.
Crag heh
Crag says, "I can fix that"
"$box" does not name an object.
Binder says, "They went bang bang, down, on your head."
You now have soapbox with object number #1176 and parent generic container (#126).
The created object is now your current object.
You drop the soapbox.
Binder says, "Maxwell's Silver Equations made sure you were dead."
Usage:  stand
Crag says, "damn, I can't stand on it"
Crag says, "I guess I better make it $furniture instead of $container"
Crag sighs
Binder . o O ( $continent )
Binder needs a beeg soapbox.
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Parent changed.
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag [to Devil]: DUCK!
Binder [to Devil]: Idle fucker.
Crag heh
Crag gives Devil an xp for 'idle'.
Crag sits on the soapbox.
Crag says, "good enough"
Binder sits on an easy chair.
Binder stands up from his easy chair.
Binder sits on the soapbox beside Crag.
Crag is squeezed off the soapbox.
Binder . o O [ heh heh heh ]
Crag says, "FIGURES"
You need to be sitting on the soapbox to push others off.
Binder stands up from the soapbox.
Binder picks up the soapbox.
Crag laughs
Binder gives Devil a soapbox.
Description set.
Crag says, "MOO programming is rediculously restrictive"
Crag says, "There is no easy way of saying that some furniture is stood on instead of sat on"
Crag says, "One would have to subclass furniture and write a stand -> sit wrapper"
Crag says, "And even then..."
Crag says, "meh"
Crag says, "stupid"
Crag says, "ok, back to work"
Crag says, "I have at least 10 minutes left."
Binder maintains a blank expression.
Binder does not do anything to incite Crag to engage in more MOO code.
Crag heh
Crag says, "It would take more than that"
Crag says, "BEM is all that matters right now"
Crag says, "And when I have PrimordialMUD up and running I can implement sensible text interaction there."
stormagnet just managed a two page essay from memory in 22 minutes
stormagnet says, "It wouldn't be good enough for the exam, but it's a start"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm leaving soon.
Crag says, "traffic looks mellow."
stormagnet says, "okay, I'll pack up and head over :)"
Crag says, "I'll be in your area bout 6:20, possibly sooner"
Crag nods.

[Idling at 6:06 P.M. on Mon, Feb 13: and rots]
Binder finishes his weekly review, woo!
Binder pokes Crag.
Binder [to Crag]: http://www.shkoo.com/nils/useful/
Binder [to Crag]: See anything you recognize?
Crag [to Binder]: ColdMUD.  So this person must be one of the old LambdaMOO 'Power Elite'.  All the other ColdMUD contributers would know what their contributions had been.
Crag says, "In other news, I just tried out svk, and it is teh awesome"
Crag says, "I think it may fix what little is wrong with svn"
Crag says, "For example, it moves metadata out of the working copy area"
Crag says, "It provides the 'depot' thing that perforce has"
Crag says, "That is, there is another layer of namespace between the storage and the usage"
Crag says, "So for example, one can have //depotname point to svn+ssh://real-depot.whatever.com/var/lib/svn/depotname, and then have a copy of //depotname/project in //myprojects/project"
Crag says, "and THEN, you can check out from //myproject/project/.../whatever into a local working copy"
Crag says, "And when you commit, it's to your local fork"
Crag says, "If you want to push to real-depot.whatever.com, it's an svk push"
Crag says, "And pulling upstream changes is svk pull, of course"
Crag says, "But it still distinguishes between upstream, your local cache of upstream, your local fork of that cache, and your working copy"
Crag says, "anyway, I'm pleased"
Crag says, "Not least of all because I can use revision control without having ssh access to wrack"
Crag says, "But I'm also pleased because it simplifies managing multiple simultaneous views of the a source tree"
Crag says, "SVN already had the ability to muck about in the namespace all willy-nilly, but with SVK there's an extra layer so I don't have to worry about cluttering therepository."
Crag says, "If there's clutter, it's probably just local"
Crag says, "So it appeals to the anal-retentive sysadmin in me"
Crag says, "Ah, the final word on Nils McCarthy's contrbutions: He's listed in the CREDIT files in the last release Greg Hudson published, so it's anybody's guess what his contribution actually was."
Crag says, "He's probably one of the JaysHouseMOO regulars from '92-94"
Crag says, "Maybe he's Abraxas or AcidHorse or something"
Crag says, "man, it's been a long time since I really hung out with the power elite crowd"
Crag says, "there's 32 people logged in to waterpoint right now, and I see seven names in the @who list who are ANCIENT LambdaMOO regulars."

Crag says, "well, off to bed and whatnot"
[Idling at 11:05 P.M. on Mon, Feb 13: and rots]
Binder has no idea what role Nils played.
Binder says, "I used to M* with him when he was a teenager, then I fell off M* for a while."
Binder says, "I know he and GH used to hang on Islandia or somesuch."
Crag says, "Ah, well there you go"
Crag says, "And in all my raving about how awesome SVK is I failed to mention that it appears to be implemented in Perl."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "I think I'm more interested in monotone right now but I'll see how I feel after I deploy it at home."
Binder says, "They had an amusing metaphor about addressing shortcomings in revision control systems."
Binder says, "Imagine your software is a mouse [say, the mouse in the logo at the monotone site]."
Binder says, "Say that in order to protect your software, you need to put pants on your mouse."
Binder says, "[imagine a graphic of that same mouse with pants]"
Binder says, "But the pants keep falling off."
Crag says, "I should look at monotone"
Binder says, "So you put a belt on the mouse."
Binder says, "[imagine the same graphic, but now the belt has pants.]"
Binder says, "And suspenders."
Binder says, "[and so on]"
Crag . o O ( but Binder hates pants! )
Binder says, "And then when your mouse falls asleep, someone comes along and takes its pants off."
Binder says, "So you need to avoid that."
Binder says, "[same graphic, with the mouse's eyes WIDE OPEN and a bottle of krazy glue sitting next to it]"
Binder says, "[pause for audience laughter and Clockwork Orange comments]"
Binder says, "But wouldn't it have been easier to just not wear pants in the first place?"
Binder says, "[original mouse picture, sans pants]"
Binder says, "And yes.  Yes I do."
Binder says, "Hate pants.  That is."
Binder says, "Also glue my eyes open, but that's neither here nor there."
Binder [to Crag]: Personally, I will recommend against you looking at monotone.
Binder [to Crag]: Because you already have a VCS you're happy with.
Binder [to Crag]: And for all I know, the actual code may not live up to their hype.
Binder [to Crag]: So I'll crashtest it for you and report back.
Crag heh
Crag says, "ok"
Binder says, "I do admire their spirit."
Binder says, "The head coder [?] Graydon called Bram Cohen a jerk during Q&A."
Crag says, "Heh"
Binder says, "Bram jumped up to the head of the queue to ask a question about a feature he knows it doesn't have [some esoterica about point-in-time three-way merge] and asked Graydon to explain why that doesn't work."
Crag says, "Arthur Dent?  You're a jerk.  A real knee-biter."
Binder says, "And Graydon says:  Well, there are a couple of reasons, but the most important is that there's a known algorithm, and you know it, so now you're just being a jerk.  Did you have a real question?"
Binder says, "But they're very interested in this point because afterwards Bram and Graydon and The Other Guy [he looks like the leader singer from Anthrax but I don't know his name right now] were huddled near me, talking excitedly and pointing at things on a laptop screen."
Binder says, "So maybe Bram solved their problem."
Binder . o O ( because he's that kind of a jerk )
Binder should put some work on and go to pants.
Binder idles: June is Busting Out All Over should be used in bra ads
Crag says, "Anthrax's last lead singer was Joey Belladonna: http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:9zec97q7krat"
Crag says, "Oh, I'm wrong"
Crag says, "Joey was their first vocalist, their last was John Bush"
Crag idles: doody calls
[Idling at 8:16 A.M. on Tue, Feb 14: doody calls]
Devil . o O (  heh. doody )
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag says, "Sorry about the lag"
Crag says, "it's me again"
Crag [to Binder]: I sent you a link on delicious with a list of version control systems and the reviewer's impressions and notes
Binder says, "Yeah, totally, I've stabbed him like three times and he still won't die."
Binder SQUEES at someone for:ing him a link.
Crag heh
[Idling at 9:27 A.M. on Tue, Feb 14: doody calls]
Binder jumps up and down on nagios.
Binder says, "What.  Is.  Your.  Major.  Malfunction!"
Binder hehs.
Binder says, "The author of this comparison was almost certainly at codecon."
Binder says, "Given his friendship with Bram & Graydon."
Binder says, "And now I get the Codeville jokes."
Binder [to Crag]: So an incredibly useful URL.  Thanks!
Crag [to Binder]: awesome
Crag says, "I'm getting this feeling that the software world is on the brink of a major upheaval"
Crag says, "In a good way"
Crag says, "Maybe it's just the drugs, I dunno"
Crag says, "I think I'm going to buy some books tonight"
Crag says, "I'm going to buy Godel, Escher, Bach, and maybe Perl Best Practices and another perl book"
Binder says, "WOO."
Binder [to Crag]: Awesome!  Books!  Enthusiasm!
Binder has this feeling that the software world is recurringly failing to learn from history.
Binder says, "So my next software reading will probably be old white papers or something."
Binder says, "Dusty research which has been forgotten and wheels which have already been invented."
Binder should probably start with the classic Knuth books.

stormagnet says, "Even with arthritis, I'm ACADEMICALLY HARDCORE"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That's not nearly as bad as what I was immagining."

stormagnet [to Crag]: Naw
Crag says, "This is no time to be brave"
Crag says, "Seriously"
stormagnet [to Crag]: This may help narrow down what kind of arthritis I have, tho
Crag pulls his hair out
Crag . o O ( I wasn't using that hair anyway )

Crag doesn't read Gender
stormagnet nods
Crag doesn't start now either
stormagnet [to Crag]: you should read that one
Crag says, "alright"
stormagnet says, "though everyone else is hating on it"
Crag takes a peek (because work is for chumps :)
stormagnet ^_^;;
Binder wouldn't say they're hating on it.
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "I was just a little suprised, because my initial reaction was one of total, stark recognition."
stormagnet says, "And I didn't see it as sexist, because I've seen this pattern play out across gender lines"
stormagnet says, "It's just socially conditioned on a gender basis"
Binder . o O ( that's just like a girl to say that. )
Binder sees database character encoding bite a pgsql user on a mailing list.
Binder . o O ( i thought that only happened to users of Oracle & SQL Server )
Binder says, "Dude.  Sweet."
Binder just got serial console going on this machine in the colo via Phantom BIOS.
Binder says, "So now the path from here to serial console from home would be:"
Binder says, "ssh to work bastion host, ssh to desktop, ssh to console server, attach to port to serial console."
Binder hugs himself with joy.
Crag [to stormagnet]: You're not on the brink of leaving me are you?
stormagnet BWAHS
stormagnet [to Crag]: No, but it's always a good idea to check every now and then :)
stormagnet [to Crag]: OH! I forgot to tell you the latest hilarity from the Insane Bulgarian
stormagnet [to Crag]: Last section, she just handed out a set of criteria and had us grade each other's papers.
Binder . o O ( is the Insane Bulgarian on the brink of breaking up with Crag? )
stormagnet: FLAWLESS VICTORY
stormagnet [to Binder]: No, but I may be on the brink of breaking HER

Binder . o O ( ... )
stormagnet [to Japanese History Prof]: The next exam will be written in my specialty- MICROSCOPIC HANDWRITING. With ALL the Japanese terms written in KANJI.

Devil backs away slowly, checking for exits.
Binder stabs Devil with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder [to Devil]: Where do you think you're going?
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder says, "How very curious."
Binder has been paying a consistent minimum amount to his student loan for some time.
Binder says, "Occasionally I will pay more and not push back the next pay date, just work down the principle."
Binder says, "Er, principal."
Binder says, "Anyway."
Binder says, "I would think, given that, I would see some regularity in the amount reported by them which went toward principal and the amount that went toward interest."
Binder says, "ie, amount applied to interest should be reducing [slowly] and amount applied to principal should be increasing [slowly]."
Binder says, "But that's not what I see."
Binder says, "Leading me to believe that they are insane or at least using unorthodox accounting."
Devil stabs Binder with a boney elbow.  Neat!
Binder dies from a wound inflicted by Devil with the boney elbow.
Binder has left.
Binder arrives from the heavens.
Binder eyes Devil.
Devil [to Binder]: Well! Hello there
Binder [to Devil]: Explain my accounting discrepency!
Devil [to Binder]: I'm no accountant.  I'm not boring enough.
Devil is pretty boring, too
Binder [to Devil]: But does my thesis make sense?
Binder [to Devil]: If I pay the same amount every month, surely over time the part applied to interest should decrease [since they'd want me to pay that off first] and the part applied to principal should increase [because otherwise it would never end].
Devil [to Binder]: I guess. but i thing it's usually divided. right? you're not paying 100% interest and then 100% principal once that's done
Binder [to Devil]: Correct!  I would expect it to be on a shifting ratio.
Binder [to Devil]: Say my first payment were applied, 1% of it to principal, 99% of it to interest.
Binder [to Devil]: The second one might be 2% to principal, 98% to interest.
Binder [to Devil]: And so on.
Binder [to Devil]: Until I reached something like a 1:1 ratio.
Devil [to Binder]: I'd assume it's some percentage interest+principal combined. They give you the option to make extra straight off principal.  I know i did a lot of that
Binder [to Devil]: But whatever the exact numbers, I would expect that each payment would bear a relationship to the previous ratio.
Devil [to Binder]: why wouldn't they just do 50-50? 
Binder [to Devil]: ie, I should be able to look at a series of identical payments and see the amount applied to each would have some resemblance.
Binder [to Devil]: That's not the point.
Binder [to Devil]: What I am seeing is more like, one payment is applied 80:20, another is applied 40:60, the next one is 90:10.
Binder [to Devil]: They're all over the place.
Devil [to Binder]: yeah. oh. right. because the interest is a smaller chunk of  the total
Binder suspects he's not making sense.
Devil [to Binder]: i can only assume their ratios are fictitious
Binder says, "So time for a new topic!"
Binder [to Crag]: What'd you do with that topic sign?
Devil [to Binder]: fed it to Sancha
Binder [to Devil]: That's gonna make him yowl like hell when it emerges.
Binder says, "My new topic is source control systems."
Binder was telling his grand-boss about monotone today.
Binder says, "Now I know what this company's two criteria were in choosing a SCM solution."
Binder says, "As dictated by the CTO."
Binder says, "1.  It had to require a developer to explicitly indicate that they were going to be editing a source file before they could do any work."
Binder says, "2.  It had to integrate with Visual Studio."
Binder . o O ( wah wah wah WAAAAAAAH )
Binder says, "Which explains why Perforce."
Binder gets a blistering 1MB/s on the office WLAN.
Crag summons the groundskeeper, who drops a topic sign off.  He writes `source control systems' on a slip of paper and puts it on the sign.
Binder says, "Oh yes."
Binder remembers now.
Binder shakes the topic sign.
Crag heh
Crag reads about inside-out perl objects
The groundskeeper comes by and picks up the blank topic sign.
Binder summons the groundskeeper, who drops a topic sign off.  He writes `Source control' on a slip of paper and puts it on the sign.
Binder says, "Inverted perlage."
Crag [to stormagnet]: Do you want me to pick you up before or after band practice?
Binder . o O ( during! )
Binder watches jboss build.
Crag grumbles.
Crag says, "There's some good parts to inside-out objects, but the primary objective seems to be to make Perl more like Java"
Binder says, "It's good that Bart did that."
Binder defeats jboss.
Binder says, "Or, rather, pf.conf."
Binder says, "which was the real problem."
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'll pick you up after practice

Binder idles: brewing a cuppa
Devil covers the topic sign reading `Source control' with a slip of paper reading `'tea time''.
Binder returns with another cup of The Champagne of Black Teas.
Binder waits for it to steep.
Binder says, "One of the artists here has a teapot.  He puts loose tea in the central cylinder and adds hot water from the 190 degree tap and steeps it."
Binder says, "He says some teas are harder than others to get out of the cylinder because of leaf grain."
Binder says, "Which makes sense to me."
Devil says, "I've seen pots like that.  I think the ones at Kirin are of the general model"
Binder has seen pots like this from teasource.com and also at Peet's.
Binder says, "The thing keeping me using t-sacs is that there's no clean up with t-sacs."
Binder says, "Tea goes into pouch, pouch goes into mug, water goes into mug."
Binder says, "Steep, throw away pouch."

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $OBJECT_UTILS[1]
=======================================

These routines are useful for finding out information about individual objects.

Examining everything an object has defined on it:
  all_verbs          (object) => like it says
  all_properties     (object) => likewise
  findable_properties(object) => tests to see if caller can "find" them
  owned_properties   (object[, owner]) => tests for ownership

Investigating inheritance:
  ancestors(object[,object...]) => all ancestors
  descendants      (object)     => all descendants
  ordered_descendants(object)   => descendants, in a different order
  leaves           (object)     => descendants with no children
  branches         (object)     => descendants with children 
  isa        (object,class) => true iff object is a descendant of class (or ==)

Considering containment:
  contains      (obj1, obj2) => Does obj1 contain obj2 (nested)?
  all_contents      (object) => return all the (nested) contents of object

Verifying verbs and properties:
  has_property(object,pname) => false/true   according as object.(pname) exists
  has_verb    (object,vname) => false/{#obj} according as object:(vname) exists
  has_callable_verb          => same, but verb must be callable from a program
  match_verb  (object,vname) => false/{location, newvname}
                               (identify location and usable name of verb)
Suspending:
  Many of the above verbs have ..._suspended versions to assist with very large object hierarchies.  The following exist:
   descendants_suspended              
   branches_suspended                 
   leaves_suspended                   
   all_properties_suspended           
   descendants_with_property_suspended

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $SET_UTILS[1]
====================================

This object is useful for operations that treat lists as sets (i.e., without concern about order and assuming no duplication).

 union(set, set, ...)        => union
 intersection(set, set, ...) => intersection

 diff*erence(set 1, set 2, ..., set n)
        => result of removing all elements of sets 2..n from set 1.
 exclusive_or(set, set, set, ...)
        => all elements that are contained in exactly one of the sets

 equals(set, set, ...)
        => true if and only if all the sets are equal
 contains(set 1, set 2, ..., set n)
        => true if and only if all of sets 2..n are subsets of set 1

=> 0

Binder idles: LUNCH NOW AND ZEN
Binder returns.
Binder reads http://ma.gnolia.com/about and wonders how it might be superior to delicious, if it will be at all.
Crag says, "WELL shoot - I dunno how that vr studios interview went at all"
Crag says, "If they hire me it will be a six-figure job, because it's half management, half technical"
Binder says, "w00!"
Crag says, "I dunno"
Crag says, "I don't feel like I represented myself very well"
Binder says, "Maybe you should have represented someone else."
Crag says, "But I'm also naturally self-doubting, and this is the first time I've interviewed for a job I actually wanted"
Crag heh
Binder covers the topic sign reading `'tea time'' with a slip of paper reading `This popsicle stick doll will represent Crag'.
Crag says, "probably."
Crag says, "nic"
Crag says, "nice, even"
Binder says, "It's hard to know how one comes across in interviews."
Crag says, "that's true"
Binder has found his perception of interviews differs greatly from the perception others there have of me.
Crag says, "I'll just have to wait and see"
Crag says, "I'll say one thing though"
Crag says, "It's really nice knowing that if they don't hire me I still have a job I like."
Binder says, "Yup."
Binder says, "It puts you in the power position."
Binder says, "You don't need them as much as they need you."
Binder says, "Hey."
Binder says, "Qmail junkie."
Binder says, "My boss is trying to solve a problem."
Binder says, "Say email comes in to an address known to be 'compromised' [ie, single use for some online thing, so any email to it must be from a spammer]."
Binder says, "He wants qmail to recognize that it's compromised and defer the connection to a tarpit."
Binder says, "Seen anything to do that?"
Binder says, "Before acceptance.  So at the point where the sender says RCPT TO <known bad>"
Crag says, "That sounds familiar"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure there's a patch for qmail-smtpd to do things like that"
Crag says, "But I don't know any more than that"
Binder says, "OK."
Crag says, "I _do_ know that qmail's willingness to accept a message without checking to see if a username is valid is a favorite complaints of qmail-haters."
Binder says, "Yeah."
Crag says, "and I also know there are patches for that"
Crag says, "which is why I think the patch your looking for probably exists"
Binder nods.
Binder was hoping for some general facility for 'reroute this connection to an alternate daemon on condition'.
Binder says, "Maybe my boss will write a patch to do it."
Binder shrugs.
Binder says, "He's a smart guy, it's quite conceivable."
Binder goes hum.
Binder says, "I bet he could do it with pf."
Binder says, "Since it's stateful and reads packets."
Binder says, "Match a known bad email address, load a rule to route that connect to a tarpit."
Binder goes @@.
Binder says, "He just turned off ip restriction on the ruleset for the ftpd."
Binder says, "It's going NUTS."
Crag says, "It shouldn't be hard to write."
Crag says, "The qmail source is brusque, but obvious"
Crag says, "it's not pretty, but it's incredibly easy to read (for me at least)"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Binder won't worry about it anymore.
Binder says, "He'll figure it out."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I want a more convincing, more succint way of saying the thing I keep saying in different ways, whatever it is"
Binder says, "Maybe you should pipe your words into gzip."
Crag . o O ( I hope stormagnet's absence does not fortell of a bad day at school )
Binder suspects she's kicking ass and taking names.
Binder says, "Maybe she had to use her wireless computing device as a bludgeon and is letting the blood dry before using it."
Crag nods solemnly.

@QUOTA
======

Usage:  @quota [<someone>]

Each player has a limit as to how much database disk space e may consume with their objects, properties, and verbs.  Objects are periodically measured (and can have their measurement forced---see help @measure).  If a player is over quota after a measurement, e will not be able to @create any objects, use @copy, @verb, or @property to grow any objects.  Existing properties and verbs may be edited/changed at will, even while over quota.

The @quota command prints out your current quota and measured usage.  If you have more than one character, it will summarize all your other characters' usage as well.

@quota <player> will print out the quota and usage of another player.  [Note: you will not be able to obtain second character information for another player; whether primary or secondary character, the @quota display will only show one character's quota.]

@quota prints a time of measurement in its display.  This is the time of the oldest measurement out of all your objects.  For example, if you @measure three of your objects right now, those individual times get updated, but if you still have a couple of objects with older measurements, that older time will be the time printed by @quota.  This is confusing to many people.

If you want to get more quota, please see `help quota-policy'[1].


 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax:  @quota <player> is <number> [<reason>]

This second and more interesting form of the verb changes a player's quota to the given number.  Mail will be sent to $quota_log; the message will include the <reason> if such is given.

Crag [to Devil]: I've seen code like that in tools supplied by HP to make their shit interoperate

Crag says, "And the two big apps are mostly java"
Crag says, "I mean, it's fine to use The Right Tool..."
Crag says, "But it's not OK to write a VB wrapper for Perl"

Crag says, "And if that was all that was wrong I'd be very happy"
Crag says, "Their perl program interpolates the text of the messages it's handling"
Crag says, "So escape'd chars are converted"

Crag says, "I'm not sure why \p doesn't become p"
Crag says, "but whatever"

Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "I still find a lot of Dilbert too close for comfort"
Crag says, "I like the stuff I can't relate to though"
Crag says, "Anything about elbonia or the wide-eyed intern amuses me"

Crag says, "I'm stunned."
Binder has a problem when he finds out that some creative person is a moron, he no longer enjoys their creation.
Crag says, "he seems like the last person to go for that crap"
Crag says, "yeah, Raine has that too"
Crag says, "I do a little bit, but not to the same degree"
Binder [to Crag]: http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/scott_adams_is_a_wally/
Binder [to Crag]: Some commentary on a piece he wrote, which links through to the original post.
Binder [to Crag]: So you can follow it, read what he said, and then read it picked apart.
Crag says, "I just googled about it"
Crag says, "I'm reading the first hit, a post on dilbertblog.typepad.com"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "In the article I'm reading he says"
Crag | Note: I.m not a believer in Intelligent Design, Creationism, Darwinism, free will, non-monetary compensation, or anything else I can.t eat if I try hard enough.
Crag . o O ( I want a firefox plugin which converts unicode quote to ascii quote )
Crag says, "anyway, reading on"
Crag says, "The post I read did not sound like Scott coming out in favor of ID, so I'm following your link now."
Crag says, "The post you linked to isn't very well written.  The author seems to be of the impression that Adams was taking a side, when this is clearly not the case at all."
Crag says, "I don't think Adams is into ID, I think he just likes to stimulate discussion and get people to challenge their assumptions."
Crag says, "And I think he's lazy"
Crag moves on to part 2
Binder says, "So you think he's written at least three posts about teaching ID in school, but not taking a side?"
Crag says, "He's not in favor of teaching ID at all"
Crag says, "he says it might be worthwhile to use ID as an example of not-science, but he doesn't come out in favor of teaching it"
Crag says, "I don't think he's into ID"
Crag says, "I think he's pretending to favor ID to piss people off"
Crag says, "And the blog you posted fell for it hard"
Crag says, "Scott Adams is a lot like Dave Barry"
Crag says, "They don't really care about anything"
Crag says, "They just mouth off a lot"
Crag says, "For Dave Barry it's fart jokes, for Scott Adams it's people jokes"
Crag says, "All of the refutations in that blog post are refuting what Adams claims the IDist say.  Adams isn't saying he endorses the claims."
Crag says, "That was no accident."
Binder scratches his head.
Crag says, "It's a de-referencing problem, I think"
Crag says, "I think Adams is throwing out pointers to controversial stuff just to promote himself"
Crag says, "If he took a side he'd lose the audience"
Binder says, "Sort of like how sometimes on Fox news, the reporters will say "some people say that Bush is the best president ever" but they don't really believe it?"
Crag ..
Crag says, "If he represented the debate accurately there'd be nothing to post about"
Crag says, "Because there is no real debate"
Crag says, "I don't think he would be as vague as he is if he wanted to take a side publicly"
Crag says, "I don't claim to know what he actually thinks"
Binder raises an eyebrow.
Crag says, "But I'm not seeing anything in Scott's posts which says he endorses ID"
Binder | Ive been doing lots of reading on the subject, trying to gather comic fodder. I fully expected to validate my preconceived notion that the Darwinists had a mountain of credible evidence and the Intelligent Design folks were creationist kooks disguising themselves as scientists. Thats the way the media paints it. I had no reason to believe otherwise. The truth is a lot more interesting.
Binder says, "That's the part just before the bit you quoted from him."
Crag says, "Yeah, the truth _about the debate_"
Crag says, "He doesn't say ID IS REAL!!!!"
Crag says, "He's playing the audience"
Crag says, "What he says in that paragraph about the public debate is true"
Crag says, "Mind you, I disagree with what he's doing"
Crag says, "I think he makes the problem worse with his posts"
Binder says, "Only if he's disinterested."
Crag says, "But I don't think they reveal anything about his own views"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Er"
Binder says, "Let's try a hypothetical."
Crag says, "no"
Crag says, "sure"
Binder says, "Let's say I have no opinion on emacs versus vi."
Binder says, "But I want to make a cartoon about the disputes between emacs users and vi users."
Binder says, "So I do some research and I find out, hey, there are some really good reasons to use either of them."
Binder says, "So then I make a blog post and I say: hey, the media has made it seem like vi is really bad and emacs is really good, but I did some research and it turns out it's not that simple"
Binder says, "Is that roughly similar to what you see his perspective as being?"
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "That's roughly analogous"
Binder says, "So I make that post and there are lot of emacs fans who jump on it and say:  see?  He's supporting vi!"
Binder says, "So then I make a new blog post."
Binder says, "And I say:  no, I'm not supporting vi, but here are some really good things about it and some really bad things about emacs."
Binder says, "More people jump on me and say:  dude, why are you supporting vi, don't you know it's crap?"
Binder says, "And I make a third post."
Binder says, "And I say:  let me be perfectly clear, I do not and have never supported vi, but consider this thought experiment, wherein vi gives you four hour orgasms and none of the emacs users ever get off."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'd agree with that analogy and still stand by my assertion."
Binder says, "Am I inciting debate, clarifying debate, muddying the debate, or supporting vi?"
Crag says, "Drawing attention to yourself"
Crag says, "I think he's just drawing traffic"
Crag says, "I could see it as looking like support for vi"
Crag says, "But I really doubt he cares"
Crag says, "I don't think he'd post about it if he cared"
Crag says, "And furthermore, his criticizms of the pharyngula.org posts were identical to mine"
Crag says, "which doesn't necessarily mean anything"
Crag says, "But it comforts me :)"
Crag says, "I also admit that I don't want to believe that Scott Adams believes in ID, and that I'm willing to go to great lengths not to believe it."
Crag says, "I'd feel the same way if he came out as a flat-earther or whatever"
Crag says, "The thing is, he claims not to have heard credible arguments from scientists"
Crag says, "That's where his act fails"
Crag says, "because it's trivially easy to find credible arguments from scientists"
Crag says, "Scientific American has one in every other issue"
Crag says, "So if he's not pretending then he's either lying or stopped being intelligent."
Crag says, "Any of those are possible"
Binder says, "And the last is what many people view his root cause as."
Binder says, "That's been snookered by ID."
Binder says, "Er, that he has been."
Binder contracts too much!
Crag says, "And I can't really argue against that point of view"
Crag says, "The data we have implicates Adams as an idiot"
Crag says, "And it's only my faith in his cynicism which keeps me hopeful. :)"
Crag says, "ANd in completely other news, my battle against 'www' shows no signs of progress"
Crag says, "The sites I visit which have A records for their domains redirect to the www version"
Binder says, "I know how you could win that war."
Binder says, "Two ways.  Actually."
Crag looks interested.
Binder says, "Way one:  destroy all non-web services in the world.  Then, obviously, the only reason to visit a site is for http or https and so the www. is redundant and not needed."
Crag heh
Crag . o O ( people would still use www )
Binder says, "Way two:  provide a patch to BIND 9 which gets accepted upstream which automatically discards www as a hostname."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "that would be awesome."
Crag says, "I don't really want to banish www, I just want it to be meaningful"
Crag says, "If a site has a www it better have a somethingelse.example.com that isn't a world wide web page"
Crag says, "But which speaks http"
Crag says, "on port 80"
Crag heh
Crag says, "or https on 443, obviously"
Crag says, "it's just another example of how I like to make things more difficult for other people"
Binder laughs!
Binder says, "There is a thing which Vy does."
Binder says, "when she is watching me play video games."
Binder says, "She will say:  you know what this game needs?"
Binder says, "And I will say:  a way for it to be harder?"
Crag . o O ( sharks! )
Binder says, "And then she will tell me her idea"
Binder says, "And it will always be a way to make the game harder."
Binder says, "Every time."
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Like in Gladius."
Crag says, "I remember that"
Crag says, "I remember her talking about ways to make Gladius harder when she was up here visiting"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "That wasn't an isolated incident."
Binder says, "She believes games I play aren't hard enough."
Crag says, "Which makes her an excellent Paranoia GM, heh"
Binder says, "Which is true, in that I can complete most of them."
Binder has given up on a few.
Binder says, "Ico, for example."
Crag groans
Crag says, "I hated Ico"
Crag says, "I kept saying 'This Is Stupid' over and over"
Crag says, "And after 15 minutes I quit playing"
Crag says, "I can't comprehend the kind of mind which would find a game like that entertaining"
Binder can.
Binder says, "I would have found it entertaining to watch."
Binder says, "Like if there were an Ico cartoon show."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "that wouldn't be a game"
Binder says, "Great stuff.  'OHO HO HO!  Look, the shadows stole the princess AGAIN!  That's so funny!'"
Crag says, "I would have found it entertaining if it had been less opaque"
Binder says, "But playing it?  Tedious."
Crag says, "yes, that too"
Crag says, "horrible design"
Binder says, "Probably the cinematic cut scenes were my favorite parts of it."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "brief respite from the horror of trying to get the guy to do stuff"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "'Thank Grod, I've triggered something which won't jump out at me and undo all my progress'"
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder nests quotes to convey that he is quoting himself.
Crag heh
Binder says, "something something."
Crag says, "I wonder how many playtesters died in the making of that game"
Binder says, "I learned something about Python today."
Binder says, "And I was going to tell you about it."
Crag says, "Please do!"
Binder says, "Ah, constructors and deconstructors."
Crag says, "I may have to get very cozy with Python if I get the VR Studios job"
Binder says, "Like Perl and unlike Java/C++, no explicit constructors."
Binder says, "But the idiomatic constructor is named __init__."
Binder says, "And once you declare it, the most-descended one is the only one executed."
Binder says, "And this applies for all methods."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "So all methods need to explicitly pass the call up to their parents."
Binder says, "But there's a super object to make that easy."
Binder says, "And methods don't have public/private distinction or same-class privilege."
Binder says, "So say you have A parenting B parenting C."
Binder says, "If C.waxMyMonkey() masks B.waxMyMonkey(), it will need to call up into the parent."
Binder says, "And if B.waxMyMonkey() calls a calculateHowShiny() which is in B."
Binder says, "But C also declares a calculateHowShiny(), the call tree from B.waxMyMonkey() goes to C's calculateHowShiny(), not B's."
Binder says, "ie, you go to the bottom of the object stack and race up it any time you call a method to find the lowest matching one."
Crag says, "hm"
Binder says, "And it's not as painful and confusing as it might be [as my prom date said, famously] because there's no method-distinguished-by-argument-signature in Python."
Binder says, "ie, each method name must be unique within the class."
Crag says, "does this lead to methods named __classname__methodname?"
Binder says, "It is an error to have object Cheese declare a method curdle(howManyDays) and curdle(whatColor)"
Binder says, "Mmm, it shouldn't."
Binder says, "Because it's got multiple inheritance."
Crag says, "I meant for allowing effectively private methods"
Crag says, "To prevent namespace collisions between parent and child method names"
Crag says, "unintended namespace collisions"
Binder says, "Ah!  Well, the idiom is that __FOO__ is probably an only-internally-interesting method or data but it's not enforced."
Crag says, "hm"
Binder says, "So, yes, if you absolutely wanted to have A.dipthong and B.diphthong where A & B are related but the methods are completely different ... you could do A.__A_private_diphthong and B.__B_private_diphthong."
Binder says, "To distinguish them."
Binder says, "But that's perverse and you shouldn't want to do that."
Binder says, "So put it down!"
Crag says, "I agree"
Binder slaps Crag's hand.
Crag says, "ow!"
Crag says, "but this means users of a class need to know the complete private method namespace of all the classes ancestors?"
Crag says, "Or do they use anonymous subs stored in class vars?"
Crag says, "Are class vars private to the defining class?"
Binder crosses his eyes.
Crag heh
Binder says, "You're conflating some things because I have been less than complete in my descriptions of Python."
Binder says, "Largely because I only tell you interesting-good or interesting-bad things."
Binder says, "First, there's no real 'private' distinction."
Binder says, "If you want to inspect an object for methods, getattr is a system method to interrogate objects."
Binder says, "There's a type method which will tell you what the parts of the object are."
Binder says, "And the convention is to give each object a documenting string."
Binder says, "Also any method."
Binder says, "And that is done by syntax like this:"
Binder says, "class yourMom(aMom):"
Binder says, " "Your mom is just a mom, so don't feel special.""
Binder says, "  def sendFlowers(howMany):"
Binder says, "    super.sendFlowers(howMany)"
Binder says, "Where Your Mom is just... is the documentation of the class."
Crag says, "ok"
Binder says, "And that gets stored on the object."
Binder says, "In a property named object.__doc__"
Binder says, "And so on."
Binder says, "Because everything [EVERYTHING!] is an object in Python."
Crag says, "I like that part"
Binder says, "There are Good Practices for every level from a method to a function to an object."
Binder says, "such as supplying a documentation string."
Binder says, "Oh, and on the subject of anon methods."
Binder says, "Python has lambdas."
Binder says, "So you can have dynamic one-line run-time defined methods."
Binder . o O ( if you are kuhrazee )
Binder . o O ( or a recovering lisper )
Crag says, "I did know about lambdas"
Binder says, "So have I clarified or confounded the issue or just drawn more traffic to my Python-yakking site at www.www.www.www.python-yakker.org?"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I believe the most accurate and succinct answer would be 'yes'"
Crag says, "So Python does have non-method functions within classes then?"
Crag says, "or not?"
Binder says, "Really?  Because I thought no had one fewer characters."
Crag says, "But 'yes' is more accurate. :)"
Binder ponders.
Binder says, "Mmm, no.  I'll say no.  All do-something-with-data processes in python are methods of an object."
Binder says, "Since every data type is, itself an object, the most primitive thing is still an object."
Binder says, "An int is an object and has methods on it, for example."
Binder says, "But a lambda is still hanging off of a method."
Binder says, "It has to be invoked through an object."
Binder supposes you could have a degenerate case where you didn't explicitly create an object and had a lambda but it would still be considered a method on the auto-generated object named __main__ you get at runtime.
Crag says, "If I have a utility function called '__utility__' on my class and a child overrides it (but preserves the prototype), my invocations of __utility__ from other parent methods will go through the child version?"
Crag [to Binder]: and I don't know the details of the coal mine explosion story.  I heard it passed down.  I didn't even know about it until after my grandfather died.
Binder says, "Your understanding of what would happen with __utility__ corresponds to mine with one correction:  there's no prototype to preserve.  So long as the NAME is the same, the invocations of __utility__ from parent class route through children classes for the lowest named __utility__."
Binder says, "It doesn't matter what parameters any __utility__ take or what arguments you give to your __utility__ call, so long as it's the same name, it'll match."
Crag says, "oh ok"
Binder says, "Python methods can have optional parameters and the way to make them optional is to give them a default value."
Crag says, "The lack of private methods seems like it would cause trouble when working with other people's code."
Binder says, "Oh, and you can call methods with parameters out of order, if you're insane, by specifying which value is which parameter."
Crag heh
Crag says, "As a matter of fact, yes, I am insane."
Binder says, "So say you've specified:"
Binder says, "def myDogHasFleas(howMany, whatKind, withWhom='your mom', getStuffed=True):"
Crag . o O ( nice )
Binder says, "You could call it like this:"
Binder says, "myDogHasFleas(3, 'furry', 'your dad', False)"
Binder says, "Which would be the Expected Use."
Binder says, "Or you could call it like this:"
Binder says, "myDogHasFleas(6, 'burning')"
Binder says, "And withWhom would default to 'your mom' and getStuffed to true."
Binder says, "Or you could call it like this:"
Binder says, "myDogHasFleas(withWhom='uncle spanky', whatKind='yatta!', howMany=8)"
Binder says, "Changing around the order from the prototype by using parameter= to tell Python what you're talking about and letting getStuffed default to True."
Crag says, "I can't see the value in that feature"
Crag says, "If I want key-value pairing I can use a hash"
Crag says, "Or maybe Python's ad-hoc hash syntax is prohibitively expensive?"
Crag says, "Matt from VR Studios confessed yesterday that the toontown client builds just fine on Linux"
Crag says, "Which is completely unsurprising since it's almost entirely python"
Binder says, "The value in that feature is probably cooperating with methods in classes created by crazy people."
Binder says, "Something where you don't want to have to rewrite it or stub-extend it JUST to change argument ordering but clearly they're ALL WRONG."
Binder says, "At that point, using some methods of your own with sensible argument sequence and using parameter= to call a method on their classes may seem a suitable compromise."
Binder shrugs.
Crag says, "yeah, I can see that"
Binder says, "Or not.  I'm just saying what one can do, I'm not taking a position on the issue.  Visit my site."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Vote Quimby."
Binder finds news stormagnet can use.
Binder [to stormagnet]: http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/16/cuppycake_gumdrops_s.html
Crag grins.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm reading some field dependence stuff, and it reminds me of people's difficulties understanding pointers in C and references in Perl
Crag [to stormagnet]: was that why you kept bringing it up?  I don'
Crag says, "don't remember"
Crag . o O ( some day I will have a keyboard with a shorter enter key )
Crag . o O ( farther from ' )
Binder dreams of that day.
Binder says, "Hey, I bet DVORAK would move the ' away from enter."
Crag says, "AT WHAT COST!?"
Crag says, "Won't someone think of the children?!"
Crag grins.
Binder . o O ( mmm children )
Crag says, "My doctor is such a pusher"
Crag says, "I mentioned that I might be moving to California and she insisted that I schedule a visit to get a parting prescription when I do"
Crag says, "TO tide me over while looking for a new doctor"
Crag says, "But the best part"
Crag says, "She called it a stash"
Crag says, "AND"
Crag says, "Today she started talking about other drugs she could get me IN ADDITION to what I'm already taking"
Crag says, "that woman disturbs me"
Binder will take any spare drugs off your hands.
Crag [to Binder]: Raine has first dibs
Crag says, "She gets my leftover focalin"
Crag says, "She might be willing to share the wealth, though."
Binder says, "Though it's a valid concern.  People who change doctors locally, not even move to another state, often have hassles getting their prescriptions filled."
Binder says, "Meaning it can be weeks without having medication."
Binder says, "That can really wreck people."
Crag says, "Oh yes, that's true, but for the drugs I'm taking it hardly seems like something for her to be as excited about as she was."
Crag says, "If I were less functional without drugs it would be a much more serious concern"
Crag says, "It was her eagerness to get met a stash that amused me"
Binder says, "Maybe she thinks you'll put out if she gets you high."
Crag shudders in disgust
Crag says, "I hope I'm never that high"
Binder says, "You should do what I do."
Binder says, "Select your doctor based on how hot she is."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I definitely should."
Crag says, "I will begin my search after the job situation is resolved"
Binder . o O ( but it never resolves )
Binder says, "Job situations don't resolve, they evolve."
Binder says, "At least mine do."
Crag says, "I mean the VR studios part"
Crag says, "If they hire me I'll be moving soon"
Crag says, "No point looking for a doctor if I'll be moving in a few months."
Binder shrugs.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm heading down now.  If I don't hear from you by 5:15 I'll give you a call.
Crag idles: but not for the reason you think
[Idling at 4:25 P.M. on Thu, Feb 16: but not for the reason you think]
Crag bleah
Crag [to Binder]: I'm obsessed with figuring out if Scott Adams favors ID now
Crag says, "I think his promotion of his latest book, "God's Debris", provides the final evidence I need that he's just promoting himself, but I'm going to have to read the book first."
Binder reads reviews of God's Debris.
Crag says, "It's a free download, so I'm reading it today"
Crag . o O ( which was also part of the motivation for my post in Drugs> )
Crag says, "I'm on page 39, and I'm utterly convinced that Adams' philosophy is effectively identical to mine.  But that could be the scotch talking."
Binder says, "Scott Adams had scotch?"
Crag says, "Probably, but I was refering to the scotch I'm having"
Binder looks at the clock.
Binder [to Crag]: OK, then!
Crag says, "It's a re-hash of The Matrix"
Crag says, "only in Richard Bach style"
Crag says, "WHAT'S REAL?!?!"
Crag [to Binder]: You're just jealous 'cause I have three day weekends every week and they start on Thursdays.
Binder [to Crag]: I'm jealous because you have scotch and I don't think I do, not even at home.
Binder [to Crag]: I think we have some liquers and vodka and lots of wine.
Binder [to Crag]: Our liquor cabinet reflects Vy's tastes, more or less.
Binder says, "From the Amazon reviews, I kind of got the idea that God's Debris was meant to be evocative of Illusions and Ishmael and Socratic dialogues and the French philosophy which Matrix is derived from but the name of which escapes me."
Crag [to Binder]: I'm enjoying a fine McClelland's Islay.
Crag says, "And yes, that summary sounds about right"
Crag says, "It's not nearly as daring as Adams would like to think it is"
Crag says, "It's a lot like _What The Bleep_, sadly"
Crag says, "That is, it highlights how science is about _how_ and religion is about _why_ and then it tries to make that into a Big Thing."
Crag says, "It would be more entertaining if the voices of the two players weren't so pretentious"
Crag says, "I'm also particularly well prepared for reading it because I've been reading Brian Greene's "The Fabric Of The Cosmos""
Crag says, "Be's the enthusiastic string theory guy"
Binder knows him.
Binder has [had?] a copy of his String Theory book.
Binder says, "It was a good read."
Crag says, "Definitely"
Binder says, "Reminded me of Hawking's Brief History of Time, in terms of accessability."
Crag says, "I like Greene a lot"
Binder says, "ie, I didn't need to have an astronomy degree to Get It."
Crag says, "I've been wanting to read Hawking's book too"
Binder says, "It's a good fast read."
Crag says, "cool"
Binder thinks there's also a Nova special miniseries about it.
Binder says, "Devil might know."
Crag says, "That would figure :)"
Crag says, "Heh, on page 53 Adams starts talking about BEM :)"
Binder . o O ( bug eyed monsters! )
Binder gapes at his coffee stained shirt.
Binder says, "WTF?  How did this happen?"
Binder says, "I mean, aside from my drinking coffee."
Crag [to Binder]: I blame the Democrats!
Binder says, "It's a wonder any of it made it into my mouth."
Binder too!
Crag says, "Those gay-ass coffee-spilling bastards!"
Binder goes out and votes a straight Republican ticket.
Crag too
Binder says, "Fucking gay-ass coffee-spilling wine-swilling limousine-riding tax-raising cowboys!"
Binder says, "Wait, not cowboys.  Democrats."
Binder was confused.
Crag says, "It's an easy mistake to make"
Binder says, "It's the hats."
Crag says, "I used to accidentally make contributions to the Cowboy Party."
Crag says, "That might not be true"
Crag says, "Yes, the hats.    no.  What?"
Crag says, "Democrats wear hats?"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "That changes everything."
Binder says, "To hide their horns."
Crag goes back to the drawing board.
Crag says, "I knew Democrats were horny (fuck the vote), but I didn't think it was literal..."
Binder says, "We're living in late modernity."
Binder says, "All the cliches have come home to roost."
Crag says, "Post modern cliches.  Awesome."
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'postmodern'.
Binder says, "I'm not entirely sure we're past modernism."
Binder says, "I think it's premature to call this time post modern."
Crag says, "that's the irony"
Binder says, "Though I fully agree with Sterling."
Binder says, "The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed."
Crag says, "I could get behind that"
Binder . o O ( i'd hit it )
Binder [to Crag]: Have you seen that ad?
Binder [to Crag]: McDonald's had an ad campaign for their "cheese" "burgers" where the tagline was "I'd hit it."
Binder [to Crag]: And everytime I saw it, I thought about American Pie and some mad cheeseburger fucker.
Binder says, "BigMac!  I'd hit it!"
Crag says, "I heard about that"
Binder says, "OK, for me to have this much coffee on me, this dry, already, I must have spilled on myself previously."
Binder says, "And only now am I noticing it."
Crag [to Binder]: you might have a drinking problen
Binder eyes Crag.
Crag [to Binder]: you should take drinking lessons
Binder says, "It's not a problem!"
Binder says, "It's a feature."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "It's only a feature if you document it"
Crag says, "Where is your documentation?"
Binder says, "I use XP.  XP means never having to document."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "it's funny because it's true"
Crag says, "ugh, this book is a lot like What The Bleep"
Binder says, "I remember that you didn't like that movie."
Crag says, "Lucky for me I have no breakfast or lunch to throw up"
Binder didn't see it because it looked like something I wouldn't like.
Crag says, "because Devil would make me spread it around again if I did"
Crag [to Binder]: it was ... sad
Binder says, "ie, smug half-clever simplicity"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "that's an excellent summary"
Binder says, "Masquerading as DEEEEP.  THOOOOOUGHTS."
Crag says, "stormagnet gives an excellent rant on the subject"
Crag says, "yes, that too is accurate"
Binder says, "stormagnet gives an excellent rant on ______"
Crag says, "that's true too :)"
Binder says, "Also."
Binder says, "I misinformed you about Python."
Binder says, "Because I am a LIAR!"
Crag says, "Oh!  Tell me more!"
Binder says, "No, wait."
Binder says, "I am a liar, but that's not why I misinformed you."
Crag says, "Nevermind the why, I want the how :)"
Binder says, "I misinformed you because I hadn't yet reached a significant point in the tutorial."
Binder says, "Python does [kind of] have private object pieces."
Binder says, "It's about as private as Perl, ie, you can break the wall if you really want to."
Crag says, "That's good enough for me"
Crag says, "I don't expect my language to provide security"
Binder says, "But the convention is that when you name a public data/method you would call it foo."
Binder says, "When you name an automatic method which will be called by a core function, it is named __foo__."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "When you name a private method/object which no one else should want to fondle, it's __foo."
Binder says, "If you try to call Cat.__whisker(), python will tell you it doesn't exist."
Binder says, "But if you really really want to get at it, you instead call Cat._Cat__whisker()"
Binder says, "So it uses automagic name mangle and unmangle to hide stuff, ala some C++ compilers."
Crag says, "And if Cat and Animal both define __wisker you can access either through ._Animal__whisker or ._Cat__whisker?"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "That sort of magic saddensm e"
Crag says, "saddens me, even"
Binder says, "I think it's a compromise."
Crag says, "It does smell like compromise"
Crag says, "It is somehow unsatisfactory"
Crag says, "It reminds me of file extensions in CP/M and later DOS"
Crag says, "it's an uncomfortable merging of namespaces"
Crag says, "I may have to learn more about Python just so I can explain better why I don't like it"
Crag says, "Which is a recurring pattern in my life"
Crag provides a Scott Adams/God's Debris update: Scientific determinism contradicts free will!!! OH NOES!
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure the conclusion is going to be: science is accurate in reporting the mechanisms, and anywhere that science defers to probability, that's God's domain."
Binder calls off his busy schedule of deciding what to do next and converts to deterministic sitting on his ass.
Crag laughs
Crag says, "It's very close to my own philosophy, except that my final conclusion is - it's not helpful to ask these questions.  It may be amusing, but it doesn't change anything."
Crag says, "I don't know if that's Adams' conclusion yet"
Binder says, "Maybe there's no conclusion."
Binder says, "Maybe he saves that for the sequel."
Crag says, "No, I think you're right"
Crag says, "I think AT&T burned Adams in a way that prevents him from having a point"
Binder LAUGHS.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "They expunged the relevancy right out of him."
Crag says, "Exactly"
Crag says, "I don't think he believies in relevancy"
Binder says, "I REBUKE THEE, DEMONS OF CONCLUSIVENESS!"
Crag says, "If there were relevancy, why didn't ISDN survive?!"
Crag says, "IT'S ALL A SHAM!  AAAAAAHHHH!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "I think you've hit the nail on the head."
Crag says, "I'm utterly certain that his mention of ID in his blog was promotion for his book.  His book takes the same stance as his blog posts."
Crag says, "All he's doing is re-hashing what's already out there"
Crag says, "It's kinda neat that he has condensed it into a more compact form, but in doing so he's thrown out everything of relevance"
Crag says, "he has lossfully compressed it down to "mu""
Crag says, "And I don't think it's an accident.  I think he's just amusing himself and generating revenue"
Crag says, "He even says he's had a hard time selling his book"
Crag says, "so ... duh"
Crag says, "he's doing whatever he can to sell it"
Crag says, "Not because he thinks it's Important but because he wants to continue living at his current level"
Crag says, "He's trying to undermine religion AND science at the same time"
Crag says, "He's saying both are simplifications of a complexity we are ill-equiped to comprehend"
Crag says, "And that The Truth is out of our reach and that we shouldn't think so highly of ourselves for thinking we might Really Have Figured It Out This Time, No, Seriously, I Mean It."
Crag says, "which I agree with, though his methods are silly"
Crag says, "But I don't think I'm the target audience."
Crag says, "I mean, besides getting paid, that's what I think he's doing"
Crag says, "I think getting paid trumps delivering messages in his mind"
Crag says, "understandably"
Binder hurms.
Binder says, "Yeah, that sounds plausible."
Crag says, "I'm about half-way through the book, so presumably I'll have a more certain assessment in a few hours"
Binder says, "I tend to parse someone attacking science for not fulfilling the promises of religion [eg, not definitively explaining everything ever] as a religious zealot."
Crag says, "but I feel pretty confident about my previous statements at this point"
Binder says, "Which is probably why I read the blog posts by Adams as being evidence of him supporting ID."
Crag says, "Most people attacking Science ARE religious zealots"
Crag says, "Likewise, most people attacking religion are scientific zealots"
Binder says, "That is, he talks like someone whose mind is clouded by religion, demanding that science act more like religion."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I think he was doing that too"
Crag says, "But I think it was intentional, an adjustment for the expected bias of his readers"
Binder says, "Whereas I tend to want science to keep asking questions, admitting that there's stuff we don't know but not because it's unknowable, just because we haven't gotten there, yet."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "that's exactly how I see things"
Crag says, "Science isn't supposed to be The Truth, it's The Current Explination"
Binder says, "Yeah.  It changes, it adapts, it grows."
Crag says, "And it ceases to be legitimate as soon as it ceases to be challenged"
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "Whereas my perception of religion is that it claims to be the definitive final answer, don't question it, just do what I tell you to do because I claim to be an authority deriving my power from it."
Crag says, "And I see it as an endless process.  I'm not comfortable with the idea that Science could ever explain Everything, because that seems just as contradictory as an omnipotent or omnicient God."
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "My experience of Religion is also unhelpful in the way you describe"
Binder says, "So religion is a tool for oppression and control and science is a tool for exploration and advancement."
Crag says, "in general, yes"
Crag says, "THough in some cases the opposite may be true, but not often enough to be relevant to the discussion"
Binder says, "Yeah, generalizing.  I'm sure some religion is more like science and some science is more like religion."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder tries to think of examples.
Crag heh
Binder says, "Oh, like the Vatican Observatory."
Binder says, "There are Jesuit astronomers who pull on the God-wants-us-to-study-his-creation lever pretty hard."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "And there are some pretty dogmatic scientists still alive in fields mostly considered obsolete and wrong, now."
Crag says, "Actually, I think where each side becomes like the other is in the first degree of separation"
Crag says, "A lot of people who follow science treat it like religion, and vice versa"
Crag says, "More specifically, astrology"
Crag says, "I am fascinated by astrology, but am particularly interested in subjecting its claims to scientific rigour (sp?)"
Crag says, "Likewise, there are many who Believe in Science without even considering what that would mean"
Binder says, "Yeah, I see true believers in science on the web quite a bit."
Crag says, "Exactly"
Binder says, "They repeat a simplified version of what they've been told / read about some scientific principle."
Crag says, "Even Brian Greene admits to having an unjustified Faith in String Theory"
Binder says, "Making them helpful to the science-hating faction which looks for evidence of flaws in science by identifying belivers in flawed versions of it."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I see to major problems with this situation: over generalization and the reconciliation of hypocracy."
Crag says, "But I have no idea what to do about it"
Binder says, "Kill everyone."
Binder says, "Back to square zero."
Binder says, "Let the octopi have the planet."
Binder <- rash
Crag heh
Crag says, "you sir, are clearly an octopus abologist"
Crag says, "You think that shark had it coming, wearing that skin"
Crag says, "Don't think I don't see through your ruse! :)"
Binder says, "My ruse?"
Crag says, "You're working for the octopi"
Binder denies everything.
Binder admits nothing.
Crag says, "Your interest in Call of C'thulu for example?"
Crag says, "But it's ok with me.  I for one welcome our tentacled overlords."
Binder . o O ( mmm tentacles )
Crag grins.
Crag plays to the audience
Binder says, "We have an audience?"
Binder looks around.
Binder says, "Oh, yeah!  The two day idle stormagnet and day idle Devil."

Binder knows how to get her online.

@MEASURE
========

Syntax:
  @measure object <object name>
  @measure summary [player]
  @measure new [player]
  @measure breakdown <object name>

When the MOO is under byte-quota, objects in the MOO are measured approximately once a week, and the usage tally as reported by @quota is updated.  You may wish to measure an object specially, however, without waiting for the automatic measurement to take place, or if the MOO is under object-quota.  @measure has some subcommands to handle this.

@measure object will measure an individual object right now, update the usage of that object in your usage as reported by @quota, and update the date of that object's measurement.

@measure summary will go through your or another player's objects and produce the summary information that is printed by @quota.  Normally this will be just the same as @quota prints out, but occasionally the addition/subtraction done to keep @quota in sync will get out of date, and @measure summary will be needed.

@measure new will go through all your or another player's objects, measuring exactly those which have never been measured before (that is, are too newly @created to have any measurement data).  This is necessary as any player is only permitted to own 10 unmeasured objects, or object creation will not be permitted.

@measure breakdown will give you full information on where an object's size is coming from.  It will offer to moomail you the result.  Caution: don't forget to delete this message, as it is large and takes up a lot of space!

Crag provides another God's Debris update: General Relativity is hard to understand!!! OH NOES!!!
Binder says, "That means it's wrong!"
Binder says, "If it's not intuitively right, it's a lie!"
Crag says, "Happily, that's not where he goes with it"
Crag says, "He proceeds to list many "real" things which aren't real: the horizon of the earth, our own shadows, the ideas which change the world"
Crag says, "If he's doing anything at all, he's just breaking down barriers."
Crag says, "But again, none of this is new."
Crag ugh
Crag says, "he's using the bind men and the elephant, only he changed the names to protect the ... non-existant."
Crag says, "instead of blind men it's bees"
Crag says, "and instead of an elephant it's the interior of a church (bleah)"
Crag says, "it is kinda funny though."
Crag quotes
Crag | "So you're saying we're like dumb bees?" I asked, trying to lighten the mood.
Crag | "Worse.  We're curious."
Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: Do you prefer to be protected from spoilers?
Binder says, "Yes, but only for things which interest me."
Binder says, "So quote all you like."
Binder says, "Because I probably won't read God's Debris."
Binder says, "Unless it catches on and I need more fodder to argue against it."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Here's the spoiler"
Crag says, "The Big Bang was God destroying itself to see what it's like.  Our purpose (and the purpose of the whole universe) is to re-assemble God so it can enjoy the experience of ceasing to exist."
Binder rolls his eyes.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "That's a hypothesis I remember coming up with when I was fourteen."
Binder says, "And it was old when I did it."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I don't think Adams actually believes it, I think he's just selling it."
Crag says, "because it the market is thirsty for this kind of thing"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "There is always a market to sell people simplistic solutions to difficult problems."
Binder says, "Even if those solutions worsen or even fail to affect the problem."
Crag says, "yep"
Crag says, "But he says that too :)"
Crag says, "It's the ultimate cop-out"
Crag says, "It's almost nihlistic"
Binder says, "He's like the Houdini of scams."
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "And I respect him for that :)"
Binder says, "This is how the magic trick works.  Now I'm going to charge you to show it to you again."
Crag grins
Crag says, "I think that's the neat thing about magic shows.  When we're kids we (some of us at least) think the magician actually has some way of defying the laws of the world.  Later we learn that all the magican has defied is our own perceptions, but later still we see that as a powerful kind of magic of its own."
Crag says, "And then it turns out that it's turtles all the way down"
Crag says, "And that each level of deception is no different from the previously debunked one."
Crag says, "But we keep going to shows anyway"
Crag says, "Or some do"
Crag shrhugs
Crag shrugs, even.
Binder says, "Yeah, the parallel for me is MUDs."
Binder says, "The first time I saw one, it was magical."
Binder says, "I had no idea what was making all the descriptions and actions and interactions happen."
Binder says, "When I saw the code, it became less magical and then as I saw more of the code it became differently magical."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Same here"
Crag laughs: "Honesty is like food.  Both are necessary, but too much of either creates discomfort."
Binder furrows his brow.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "Honesty is like food, if Scott Adams doesn't give me some, I'll shiv him in the neck."
Crag says, "he did invent his own burrito..."
Crag says, "I don't know if that counts."
Binder hasn't eaten it so, at present, no.  Does not count.
Crag says, "I guess it's the shiv in the neck then.  Now I just have to find a way to convince him to log in to the MOO."
Binder says, "Offer him money."
Crag says, "ok, all done with the book"
Crag says, "I don't take back any of my previous stuff"
Crag says, "It's exactly what it seemed like"
Crag says, "I wouldn't recommend it to you, but I might recommend it to some less in-touch people I know."

Crag [to stormagnet]: didn't mean to page that at you
Crag [to stormagnet]: also, I may be meeting Nicole about BEM today
Crag says, "So I might get home closer to 8"
Crag says, "But I'm pretty tired and I forgot my laptop so I'm going to try to keep the meeting short."
Crag says, "Or bring her home with me if she's up to it"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "eeeeeee!"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Daisy just made friends with another doggy!
Crag [to stormagnet]: They make friends?
Crag . o O ( Nintendo is taking over my wife's mind )
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet [to Crag]: it made a cute sound and everything!
Crag grins.
Binder says, "There."
Binder [to Crag]: I've reduced my potential diskspace burden on wrack.
Binder [to Crag]: Now all incoming email [which is almost entirely spam] gets forwarded back out to me @fool.manjusri.org.
Binder [to Crag]: So it's a temporary mailspool burden until fool [primary MX] goes down, at which point it will properly spool and queue there until fool is back up.
Crag [to Binder]: Excellent.
Crag [to Binder]: And thank you.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I just got a call from Lindsay.  She's having a Very Bad Day (crying on the phone), and would very much like to see us specifically.
Crag says, "I told her I'd call her when I'm done at work, but you could give her a call sooner if you like."
stormagnet [to Crag]: Can and will do
stormagnet does so immediately
Binder puts his shoes on.
Binder goes to visit the tax lady.
Binder . o O ( if i'm good i'll get a lolly afterwards )
stormagnet . o O ( mmm... loli )
stormagnet [to Crag]: Called Lindsay- Nicole has her well in hand
stormagnet [to Crag]: They're going to play at Uwaji for a while (without me! sniff!) and then head over here after
Crag [to stormagnet]: Ah, so Lindsay will drive Nicole over and I don't need to call Nicole or meet her then?
Crag [to stormagnet]: And did you get any hint as to what happened that upset Lindsay?
Ryan has connected.
Crag [to Ryan]: Welcome back :)
Ryan says, "re"
Crag [to Ryan]: Did you continue playing with felix?  Any impressions?
Ryan says, "hm"
Ryan says, "i did play some"
Ryan says, "i had some minor issues with the type system"
Ryan says, "documentation needs some work, as does some parts of the language"
Ryan says, "the object constructor syntax is very nice, but the type system doesn't accomodate it well"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Unnecessarily rigid?"

Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm headed home
Crag idles: 4:20 dude!
[Idling at 4:21 P.M. on Mon, Feb 20: 4:20 dude!]
Binder has KNIVES.
Crag says, "This is not my beautiful MOO.  How did I get here?"
Crag [to Binder]: I remembered last night why keeping the metadata out of working copies is such a great feature (of p4 and svk).  It means I can more easily use revision control for /etc and possibly other relatively static directories.
You hear a quiet popping sound; Ryan has disconnected.
< Ryan has disconnected.  Total: 5 >
You see no ryan here.
Crag says, ".svn and CVS directories confuse programs which treat directories as lists.  Last time I tried it, /etc/dnscache/root/{ip,servers} were the problem children."
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Monotone won't help you there.  It creates a directory MT."
Binder says, "We get a lot of mileage here out of having a machine which is the repository/working space and have a Makefile which pushes out the files to the place where it belongs."
Binder says, "So we might have magneto:/home/p4/admin/colossus/etc/dnscache/root/ip as a file which we edit on magneto, check ito the p4 repository wherever, and then run magneto:/home/p4/admin/colossus/etc/dnscache/root/Makefile to put ip in the right location and signal [if needed] a service reload."
Crag says, "I can see the logic in that"
Crag says, "I kinda like the idea of using a revision control system as my tripwire."
Binder says, "To kill soldiers?"
Crag ..
Crag says, "I don't know why I would have any reason to believe the intruders are soldiers... :)"
Binder says, "Information war!"
Binder says, "You see me, now, a veteran, of a thousand info wars."
Crag says, "It is not the thousand info wars you have fought once which I fear, it the one info war you have fought a thousand times which I fear."
Binder says, "But I'm really really good at it by now!"
Crag says, "but not for the reason I think?"
Crag idles: food?
[Idling at 12:13 P.M. on Tue, Feb 21: food?]
Crag says, "Aaaannndd I'm back."
Binder says, "Cool!"
Binder stands up and claps.
Crag heh
Crag says, "That reminds me of the villagers in Black & White"
Binder punches the bag HARD.   >>THUMP!<<
Crag says, "BLEAH"
The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  There are some easy chairs pushed up against the walls, one on either side of the north and south doors.
A sign here says, `Topic: flagpole sitting'
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room, a Punching Bag for Binder, a bucket, and a mop here.
Devil, stormagnet, and Binder are here, off in another world.

Dear All,

I had a chance to talk to Toontown guy in WDIG NoHo office.

He explained that this change in the network accessibility from
Japan was to maintain the security level in the Admin Server,
and they have proposed an alternative solution to us, already.

.. So, I would like to request closing this ticket.

Thank you so much for your cooperation, and sorry for the
miscommunication we had to admit this time ...

Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "boo.  That manager at Jobster with whom I had the phone interview sent me an email saying they found someone else to better fill the position."
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm definitely getting sick.  You should be extra careful.
Binder . o O ( sorry for the miscommunication we had to admit this time ... )
Binder admits of no miscommunication!
Binder dispatches Crag to Seattle Cellars.
Binder says, "It's the Last Week of their Half Yearly Sale."
Binder says, "Whatever that means."
Binder covers the topic sign reading `flagpole sitting' with a slip of paper reading `spillage'.
Crag says, "mmm, wine"
Binder nods.
Binder still gets the spamletter from that wine shop.
Crag says, "me too"
Crag says, "I haven't tried to get removed, though"
Crag says, "I keep thinking next month will be the month we have time and money to do some kind of wine adventure or something"
Binder says, "There's a wine adventure here Vy & I have been talking about going on."
Binder says, "Wine train through Napa Valley."
Binder says, "It's an Amtrak thing which goes through wine country and makes stops for tastings."
Crag says, "that sounds nice"
Crag sighs dreamily.
Crag says, "Catherine and I went to a winery tour in San Jose which was kinda fun"
Crag says, "I can't believe that was almost seven years ago"
Crag says, "wow"
Binder says, "How time flies."
Crag [to Binder]: From your post in X, your grandboss sounds awesome

Binder finds something else to like about *BSD's pf.
Binder | An example:
Binder |
Binder |     table <abusive_hosts> persist
Binder |     block in quick from <abusive_hosts>
Binder |
Binder |     pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $web_server \
Binder |         port www flags S/SA keep state \
Binder |         (max-src-conn 100, max-src-conn-rate 15/5, overload <abusive_hosts> flush)
Binder |
Binder | This does the following:
Binder |
Binder |     * Limits the maximum number of connections per source to 100
Binder |     * Rate limits the number of connections to 15 in a 5 second span
Binder |     * Puts the IP address of any host that breaks these limits into the <abusive_hosts> table
Binder |     * For any offending IP addresses, flush any states created by this rule.
Binder |
Binder says, "That's literal.  <foo> is the syntax for a table [dynamic list of entities] in pf."
Binder can see why *BSD people have such contempt for iptables.
Binder goggles.
Binder says, "Daaaaayumn."
Binder says, "pfctl -s state will show current NAT connections."
Binder has wished many times to be able to do that with iptables.
Crag [to Binder]: ipchains had the ability to list NAT connections
Crag says, "iptables moved it to /proc/whatever/hook/er"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I went home sick
Crag [to stormagnet]: but we can probably still spend time at Dante's after you're done with the movie
Binder [to Crag]: So it has.  /proc/net/ip_conntrack.
Binder [to Crag]: And it's almost human readable.
Crag says, "there you have it"
Crag says, "I look forward to hearing about Linux adopting more BSD goodness"
Crag says, "while leaving behind any BSD badness there might be"
Binder says, "pf also integrates QoS & load balancing."
Crag says, "hot damn"
Crag says, "Maybe bouncer should run BSD"
Binder says, "Take a look at the link I just delicioused you."
Binder [to Devil]: Also you.
Binder says, "I do think it is a worthwhile goal for me to learn enough about OpenBSD administration to use a dedicated oBSD box as my firewall/router/WAP."
Binder says, "A solid foundation for a LAN."
Binder says, "Especially on a low power embedded platform."
Crag nods...
Binder says, "It doesn't make sense to do everything with BSD.  But infrastructure stuff, sure."
Crag says, "that's what I'm thinking"
Binder says, "So maybe I'll move to a multiplatform model where I've got oBSD fw, *BSD mx, *BSD dns, Debian web servers, Ubuntu desktop."
Binder says, "Oh, that reminds me of a joke from CodeCon."
Crag says, "That sounds like good matching of tools to jobs"
Binder says, "Which I don't believe I've told yet."
Binder says, "So the Deme people."
Binder says, "They of the groupspace.org."
Binder says, "Had a presentation with featurelist."
Binder says, "And some of the features had asterisks."
Binder says, "Things like:"
Binder says, "multiuser chat, anonymity*, real-time foobaz, mobile platform quux*, et alia."
Binder says, "And the presenter explained:"
Binder says, "That asterisk there isn't a footnote."
Binder says, "It's a regular expression."
Crag heh
Binder says, "It means zero or more of those features actually work."
Binder cracked up.
Binder was one of the few who seemed to get it.
Crag says, "I like the idea of multiple occurances of a feature"
Binder says, "SIX LEVELS OF ZOOM."
Crag says, "anonymity, chat, chat, chat, chat, browsing, ..."
Binder says, "It's how people interact with the world so, why shouldn't software reflect it?"
Binder says, "complete work task, chat, chat, chat, chat, surf the web, chat, chat."
Crag heh
Binder had a complete fnord moment in the work breakroom.
Binder says, "There is a bottle of something in the refrigerator."
Binder says, "And everytime I see it, I completely blank on what it is or what I'm doing."
Binder says, "So I finally asked someone to open the refrigerator."
Binder says, "And tell me what the bottle label said."
Binder says, "It was the word SYNERGY."
Binder says, "For some reason, seeing it there on a bottle in the refrigerator was freaking me out."
Crag ..
Crag says, "what was in the bottle then?"
Binder has no idea.
Binder says, "But if you want to hide food from me, put it behind a bottle labelled SYNERGY, I guess."
Crag says, "weird"
Crag says, "I wouldn't eat anything labled SYNERGY"
Binder says, "Would you eat a combination of things labelled SYNERGY?"
Crag says, "I don't know..."
Crag says, "it sounds like a bad idea to me"
Binder says, "It might actualize your value-add."
Binder says, "At the end of the day..."
Binder receives email notification of yet another blog comment spam attempt.
Crag says, "... I have to ask myself: what's in it for Sancho?"
Binder yawns.
Crag heh
Binder says, "MEOW."
Crag says, "use vs. reference might be the hardest thing for me to think about while sick"
Binder ponders that.
Binder says, "Maybe it would make more sense if you were feverish."
Crag says, "I'm reading about lexical closures"
Binder says, "Without a prescription?"
Crag grins.
Crag . o O ( that's no doctor! )

Crag [to Binder]: it was the paul graham link you sent me that got me looking into them
Crag says, "naturally"
Crag says, "I'd read the article before, but this time I was looking at it with BEM in mind"
Crag says, "And then I thought I should probably try harder to grok LISP constructs"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "I think I could have been a happy Lisp hacker."
Binder says, "If I'd had more ... something."
Crag says, "parentheses?"

stormagnet: [to Professor Madge]: Now I hate you MORE!!
Crag says, "not an adequate replacement, but better than nothing at all."
stormagnet [to Crag]: Nigel?
Binder says, "Like C++."
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Crag laughs
Crag [to Binder]: who did you think was going to stab you for making fun of C++?
Binder [to Crag]: The joke made itself.
Crag says, "I guess that's true"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Nigel's not the right shape
Binder . o O ( we can rebuild him )
Binder . o O ( we have the technology )
Binder [to Crag]: What you need to do is plastercast stormie.
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'million dollar man'.
Crag [to Binder]: that's a fine idea
Binder [to Crag]: Yes, and, really, would be its own reward.

Binder [to Crag]: In Make #2 ... #3?  Somewhere in there, they explain how to do silicone casting.
stormagnet [to Crag]: At least it's not a RealDoll(tm)
Binder [to Crag]: Evidently it's cheap and easy and fun.
Crag says, "Hm"
Binder [to Crag]: And involves funky colors and textures.
Binder [to Crag]: They use it to make a touchlamp.
Binder [to Crag]: That is, it's got sensors to react to someone putting a hand on it and change the light state.
Binder [to Crag]: And they used silicone so it would be touchable, people want to handle it.
Crag ..
Crag [to Binder]: I get that a lot
Crag [to stormagnet]: I think some kind of evening hanging out after your movie would be helpful to me

Binder ponders.
Binder [to Crag]: Interrupt priority.
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I think that's about right"
Binder [to Crag]: The motive to do it is not enough to rise to the top of your queue.
stormagnet needs to stop screwing around and study
Crag says, "running vmstat on host 'crag' would show a lot of context switches and interrupts"
Confucious stands up from his easy chair.

Confucious sits on an easy chair.

Crag laughs
stormagnet stabs Confucious with a Butcher Knife.  Neat!

The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  There are some easy chairs pushed up against the walls, one on either side of the north and south doors.    Confucious is moping in a particularly dreary corner of the room.
A sign here says, `Topic: spillage'
You see a Punching Bag for Binder, a bucket, and a mop here.
stormagnet is here.  Binder is daydreaming.  Confucious is dozing.  Devil is off in another world.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Why on earth would 'on' work, but not 'in'?
Crag [to stormagnet]: because MOO is retarded
stormagnet [to MOO]: Are you a GOAT?!
Crag laughs!
The MOO nibbles on a nice yummy tin can.     --Crag
Crag [to stormagnet]: when one creates a verb, one has to choose a class of preposition or 'any'
Crag says, "'any' will of course match all of them, but that might be too much"
Crag says, "I suppose we could change :sit to use 'any'..."
stormagnet . o O ( how the hell do you sit ON a corner? )
Crag says, "it probably wouldn't break anything important"
stormagnet . o O ( I suppose it gets EXTRA points for discomfort )

Crag idles: I SLEEP NOW
[Idling at 6:09 P.M. on Wed, Feb 22: I SLEEP NOW]
Binder says, "Actually."
Binder says, "A little bird told me it's because MSFT is going to announce that their virtualPC or whatever they call the virtualization they bought the maker of [pronounced: innovated] is now free-to-use-under-some-terms and integrated into Vista RSN."
Binder says, "So it's not Xen or Bochs or QEMU or WINE or even Intel's VMT, it's MSFT which is driving this choice by vmware."
Binder says, "Another more different bird told me that vmware is developed on Linux so I fully expect that Xen has been part of their process for longer than we've known it existed."
Binder keeps a full aviary.

Crag now goes back to dying in bed
Binder says, "Good plan!"
Binder says, "Wait."
Binder says, "Not good."
Binder says, "that other word."
Devil stabs Crag with a boney elbow.  Neat!
Devil nods
Devil [to Binder]: that'll give him something to die about
Binder [to Devil]: Good thinking.
Devil [to Binder]: or not...
Binder [to Devil]: Maybe you didn't stab him hard enough?

The Entrance Hall
A sign here says, `Topic: Froot Loop Hat Head'
You see a particularly dreary corner of the room, a Punching Bag for Binder, a bucket, a mop, and a Wind-Up Mariachi Band here.
stormagnet is here, idling.  Confucious and Devil are off in another world.
The Ballroom
The Western Fireplace
The West Veranda
The North West Lawn
The Light Forest
The Dense Forest
You see a Bluegum Eucalyptus here.
The Forest Clearing
You see a Thin Kamani and a Thick Kamani here.
Crag opens the screen door.
The Yurt
You are in a building that is the size of a large gazebo or perhaps a small silo. The exterior is covered in ornately-painted canvas, featuring large yellow, orange, and blue Raffaelesco dragons. Inside, the ceiling is covered in a tessellating pattern made up of turtles.  A lumpy pillow is here.  A fluffy pillow is here.  A blue bean bag is here.  A red bean bag is here.  An Ol'cafe chair is here.  A Taco Stand is here.  A squishy pillow is here.  A rocking chair is here.  Binder is sitting on it.  An oriental rug is here.  The screen door to the Forest Clearing is open.
You see a quilt chest and a Guido van Rossum here.
Binder is here, daydreaming.
Crag has arrived.
Binder [to Crag]: Aloha.
You see nothing special.
Binder kicks his heels up and rocks out.
The screen door slams shut.
Crag says, "I appear to be alive."
[with the ice pick]
No such person.
Binder [to Crag]: How'd That Happen?
Crag says, "appropriate administration of hot sake"
Binder [to Crag]: Alternately:  well, that puts you one up on Octavia Butler.
Crag heh
Binder <- bad
Binder says, "Medicinal sake, mmm."
Crag says, "I found an image of one of my favorite commodore 64 adventure games: Twin Kingdom Valley"
Crag says, "And played it (with a walkthrough), thus renewing my passion for The ULtimate MUD or whatever"
Crag says, "Playing it reminded me how surprisingly entertaining such a simple puzzle can be"
Crag says, "Though I'm hard pressed to explain the phenomenon"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "It seems like it would be a good thing to figure out"
Binder says, "Sometimes restriction induces creativity."
Crag says, "that's true"
Crag says, "There aren't many ingredients to pick apart"
Crag says, "So I ought to be able to figure it out"
Crag says, "Supposedly the game only has 180 unique 'rooms'"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "And I use the word 'unique' loosely here. :)"
Binder says, "Like, unique by location+context."
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "And there are NPCs"
Crag says, "Which wander on their own"
Crag says, "and have their own motivations"
Crag says, "But I don't think that's a critical ingredient"
Crag says, "The game has drawings of most rooms, which may be more important than I realized in the past"
Crag says, "But they're just that.  Static drawings which take a few seconds to render when the emulator is running at authentic speed"
Crag says, "There's not any detectable humor in the game"
Binder says, "That's a plus."
Binder . o O ( stupid humor )
Crag says, "that's true"
Crag says, "What little story there is exists as background"
Binder says, "A little humor goes a long long way."
Crag says, "And is the usual Tolkein stuff"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "What keeps nagging at me is the mystery of undiscovered places"
Binder says, "Which is probably good and bad, in that there's not a lot of need to explain context to most players, but that it limits the form."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "But limiting the form may also be a good thing."
Crag says, "I think in the space the designer had to work with, not having to explain things left room for functionality and the appearence of a larger world"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "It drops into a pre-existing context."
Crag says, "I think that might be a large part of its charm for me"
Binder says, "Like a game set in the Old West of America."
Binder says, "Or the American Civil War."
Crag says, "The feeling that _just around the next corner_ is a whole new area to explore"
Binder says, "Or Gangster Chicago."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Even if the game area itself is small, it could have much more just outside."
Crag says, "contexts we have pre-populated in our heads and only need a taste of to convince ourselves there's much more nearby"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "So that's probably a major ingredient"
Binder says, "That makes sense."
Crag says, "Another major ingredient is the appearance of layers generated by revelation of secrets"
Crag says, "Swiming in magic water reveals hidden doors"
Crag says, "acquisition of keys opens new areas"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "that kind of thing"
Binder says, "So good re-use of the virtual space through layered context."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "which leads one to imagine more depth than is really there"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "There could be yet another layer."
Crag says, "one starts thinking 'I bet there is more to this...'"
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "mmm, Zelda does some of that."
Crag says, "yes!"
Binder says, "Most strongly in Windwaker."
Binder says, "You revisit places with new toys, new awareness."
Crag says, "But even in the original Zelda that was part of the fun for me"
Binder nods.
Crag sighs, remembering.
Crag says, "Metroid, too"
Binder says, "Majora's Mask does it, Ocarina of Time does it."
Binder didn't play enough Metroid to see it, but believes it.
Crag says, "I don't think it's unique to games, either"
Crag says, "Songs do it to"
Binder says, "Oh, yes!"
Crag says, "Repeat a theme with something added"
Binder says, "Refrains."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Choruses with contextual emphasis."
Crag says, "yup"
Binder says, "Second verse, same as the first!"
Crag says, "So that's an absolutely critical element"
Crag heh
Binder the Eighth, I am, I am.
Crag says, "A horse, a horse..."
Crag says, "LINE?!"
Crag says, "anyway"
Binder says, "homestarrunner dot com."
Crag nods solemnly
Binder says, "Not only does it cater to the human familiarity desire, and intrigue with the possibility of what's-different-this-cycle, it also saves game resources."
Crag says, "Good point"
Binder says, "In many cases, it's more compact to say room D is room C but now the FOO is different."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Ah, I think another important factor is the exploration itself"
Crag says, "I think my brain likes building its own copy of this virtual universe"
Binder says, "Thought experiments."
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "And map making"
Binder says, "What will happen if I do THIS?!"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Or, howcome I've never been to the middle of this area?"
Crag says, "There must be something there!"
Binder says, "I understand this space because my mental model predicted this room here."
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "It's another kind of puzzle, but more subtle than the brain-teazers we usually get in games"
Crag says, "I like in TKV that there are multiple paths too"
Crag says, "If I could remember my terminology I could give you the topoligical category the map's graph would fall under"
Crag says, "It has one-way paths, so it's directed"
Crag says, "It has cycles"
Crag says, "It has multiple paths between the same points"
Crag says, "anyway, it's just complex enough to engage my curiosity"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "But it's dense enough to be interesting too"
Crag says, "A good balance there"
Binder says, "You could flowchart it as a sequence of moves and spaces."
Crag says, "indeed"
Crag says, "In fact, I ended up re-writing most of the walkthrough as I played through it"
Crag says, "The original was... terse"
Binder hehs.
Crag says, "It looked like N/get lamp/get key/get jug/S/W/W/get flint/E/N/open grate/N/N"
Crag says, "etc"
Crag says, "Throw a little perl in there and it could have been a signature block of some sort"
Crag says, "mm, time for some tea"
Crag says, "I thought of another ingredient"
Crag says, "The feeling of ownership"
Crag says, "The goal of the game, as defined by the 'score' command is to aquire l00t"
Crag says, "In moving through the world the user does get l00t, but also gets control over areas by unlocking them and getting to know them"
Crag says, "So I took over not just the riches but also the land itself"
Crag says, "Oh yes"
Crag says, "There is a magic staff which kills anything with one hit"
Binder says, "Nice."
Binder says, "I like the domain part of it."
Binder says, "Dominion is one of those elements to a game which is a spaceship for me."
Crag says, "a spaceship?"
Binder says, "Actually, given that walkthrough, throw a little Perl -at- it and you wouldn't need a human to play the game.  :P"
Binder says, "Oh, yeah, sorry, it's a Vylarism."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "It comes from Clarion West."
Binder says, "One of the instructors [and she'd punch me if she knew I forgot which one ... Pat Murphy, maybe?] said, when critiquing a story:  I love this story because it's set on a spaceship."
Crag nods slowly...
Binder says, "So then the next week, one of the students started a critique with:  I love this story because it has race cars, which is a spaceship for me."
Crag says, "Ahhh, I see"
Binder says, "So the terminology spread and mutated and now, in Vy's circle of writing friends, a 'spaceship' is 'an element of a creation which, by itself, is enough to hold your interest'."
Crag says, "I like that idea"
Binder says, "An example might be 'horses' for girls of a certain age/mindset.  Any story or movie with horses, no matter how otherwise awful, will interest them, IF it has horses."
Crag says, "I think the meta spaceship may be a spaceship for me"
Binder says, "For me, revenge is a a spaceship.  I love revenge storylines and will read perfectly awful stories if the protagonist wants revenge."
Crag says, "Any story about ideas which are themselves amusing for people is enough to hold my interest.  Or something."
Binder says, "I will -play- perfectly awful games if my motivation is revenge."
Crag grins
Binder says, "Heh.  Motivation is a spaceship for you."
Crag says, "Could be"
Crag says, "But seriously, I think dominion is probably a spaceship for me too"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Or rather, exploration and the implied dominion that comes with it"
Binder says, "Right.  Explore/claim/defend."
Binder says, "Warcraft has that."
Binder says, "Civilization has that."
Crag says, "Yes, I was just about to mention those"
Binder says, "Settlers of Catan."
Crag says, "I'm particularly vulnerable to the randomly generated worlds which I must uncover and exploit"
Crag says, "Settlers, not so much for me. :)"
Binder says, "You might like Seafarers more, then."
Binder says, "Scenarios in it involve unknown maps."
Binder says, "You start with some tiles randomized and face down."
Crag says, "I do seem to recall liking seafarers better that one time I tried it"
Binder says, "Have to travel to them to flip them up."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "That sounds cool"
Binder says, "Good device to keep the semblance of randomness high."
Crag says, "Yes, I think it is the revelation part of exploration which stimulates me"
Crag says, "totally"
Binder says, "There's a finite number of tiles they COULD be, but it doesn't seem that way."
Binder . o O ( maybe -this- tile is the hex of infinite beer production! )
Crag says, "We have a beer explosion at the Simpsons Residence!  I'm going to need pretzels!  Repeat!  Send backup pretzels!"
Binder says, "Mmmm pretzel.bak"
Binder CACKLES at his boss.
Binder says, "He's got a whiteboard up here."
Binder says, "On it is written a bunch of stuff."
Binder says, "Princess QA just came in and was chatting with us."
Binder says, "Most about Pho."
Crag nods..
Binder says, "And she suddenly stopped, looked at his white board, and said:  call Scott!"
Binder says, "Which is written on his board."
Binder says, "My boss:  Oh, no!  His heart surgery!"
Binder says, "She thought he was serious."
Crag laughs!
Binder says, "It's been written there for six months."
Crag says, "that's awesome"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Your bosses rock"
Binder says, "My boss is awesome."
Binder says, "Bosses, yes."
Binder says, "Grandboss, also awesome."
Crag says, "You've found your happy place :)"
Binder nodnodnods.
Binder kicks his heels up and rocks out.
Crag [to Binder]: I encourage you to share any of our insights regarding fun games with your peeps over there
Binder will.
Crag says, "I'd be thrilled if your company came out with a game based on uncovering new areas and exploiting them in some way"
Binder says, "It's a small enough place that I generally see everyone who works here during the course of a day."
Crag says, "cool"
Binder says, "Likewise, if you put together even a prototype of a game like that?  Let me know.  I can put it directly in the hands of our publishing people."
Crag says, "Now that I'm thinking about it, Ultima Online had a lot of these features too"
Binder nods.
Crag [to Binder]: THat's good thinking!
Crag says, "Damn, I have all the resources to do it right now"
Crag says, "Nicole's brother is dying to make a graphical game of some sort"
Crag says, "And Nicole and Raine are excellent artists"
Binder says, "We specialize in games which are more fun than competitive but we also have channel partners who cater more to hardcore markets."
Crag says, "Between the four of us we could easily come up with something like one of those flash games you guys distribute, only targed at the Twin Kingdom Valley audience"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Absolutely."
Crag says, "damn, this might push BEM off schedule :)"
Binder LAUGHS.
Binder says, "Stay on target!"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Talk to me Goose!"
Binder says, "Cut the chatter, Red Five."
Crag says, "IT'S A TRAAAAP!"
Crag laughs
Binder idles: LUNCH NOW!
Crag says, "I've got to document these critical elements quickly while they're fresh on my mind"

Binder says, "It was AWESOME."
Crag grins.

Binder says, "Even given the substitutive nature on short notice of this lunchy."
Binder says, "Vy did a stellar job."
Crag says, "Substitutive nature?"
Binder says, "Well, last night she made Chicken Santa Fe."
Binder says, "We had it for dinner."
Binder says, "A leftover portion was packing into my lunchy."
Binder says, "Then we both got terrible stomach cramps."
Binder says, "Traced back to the CSF as Suspect."
Crag says, "ah"
Binder says, "So she scrambled to find something else to put in, in place of it."
Binder says, "Which is too bad, because I really like her CSF."
Binder says, "When she told me that would be what we had for dinner, I had ALREADY began salivating at the idea of having leftover CSF in my lunchy this week."
Binder is also reading an awesome book.
Binder says, "The Demon Princes, vol 1."
Crag [to Binder]: fiction? :)
Binder says, "Jack Vance, originally published 1964, 1964 and 1967."
Binder says, "No, I'm pretty sure it's an accurate set of prophecies about the future."
Crag heh
Binder grins.
Binder says, "Space fantasy opera revenge story."
Crag says, "Ahh, spaceship :)"
Binder says, "Protagonist is a lot like Batman."
Binder says, "If Batman had a multiplanet patrol space."
Binder says, "And five Joe Winters to hunt down."
Binder says, "It's also Jack Vance who effectively invented the magic system which TSR stole for D&D."
Crag says, "Ah so!"
Binder says, "Things like <name>'s <adjective> <noun>?  That's his nomenclature."
Binder says, "ie, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Leomund's Secure Shelter."
Binder says, "Tensor's Floating Disc."
Crag heh
Binder says, "And so on."
Binder says, "And even the idea of levels of spell and of mages."
Binder says, "So D&D owes a HUGE debt to Vance's writing."
Crag says, "Those are pretty good ideas"
Binder says, "There is, also, an RPG derived entirely from Vance's fantasy settings."
Crag says, "Highly worthy of theft"
Binder says, "Called The Dying Earth."
Crag says, "I think I've heard of that"
Binder has raved about it before.
Binder says, "Players can only earn xp by deploying dialogue appropriately."
Binder says, "Which is fucking AWESOME."
Binder says, "At the start of the session, GM gives each player three lines of dialogue, and the player picks one of their own from a list."
Binder says, "During the story, the player can say whatever they want and try whatever they want."
Binder says, "But they only EARN xp for using the dialogue, by using it appropriately."
Crag says, "yes, I remember now"
Crag says, "I remember that being a fascinating take on XP, too"
Binder says, "It's a very different mechanic and goal than many other games."
Binder can't now think of another game where dialogue is such a huge factor.
Crag says, "It's story-driving"
Binder says, "Mmm, possibly My Life With Master."
Crag says, "Which for a lot of people is the point"
Binder says, "But I only have second-hand reports of that one."
Binder says, "Yes.  TDE mechanics do what the World of Darkness mechanics say they try to do."
Binder says, "Only, TDE actually DOES it.  By rewarding the desired behavior."
Crag says, "yes, it's another simplest thing which could possibly work, too :)"
Binder says, "WoD says:  here are mechanics for building big dice pools but that's not the point of the game, we swear!"
Crag laughs
Binder says, "WoD did really push the envelope on flaw/power balance."
Binder says, "Props to them for that."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "And for providing a flypaper strategy for identifying losers."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "Oh, that's just FASCINATING about your eighth generation Malkavian Primogen but I have to, uh, go, now.  Far away.  From you."
Binder says, "I regret not doing more with a co-GM game I had going for a while in Iowa City."
Binder says, "Two-GM Vampire."
Binder says, "With players who couldn't consistently meet at the same time."
Binder says, "So we'd just schedule an hour a week for each player."
Binder says, "And keep track of where everyone was."
Binder says, "And let them impact each other's storylines."
Binder says, "A lot of work for us, but, there were two of us."
Crag says, "Interesting"
Binder says, "A lot of fun deus ex machina."
Crag says, "That reminds me of an interesting game I heard about up here"
Binder says, "Oh, you need to steal a car?  Hmm, there's this one right here with windows conveniently tinted dark so you can drive during the day ..."
Binder says, "... (in the trunk of which is sleeping the character of another player)"
Crag says, "It's not only two-GMs, but each player has two charachters and the players play their alternates on alternate sessions"
Crag says, "And so there are two parties, played by the same people, but the two parties interact with each other indirectly"
Binder says, "Oh, that is neat."
Binder hopes that is in a homebrew world.
Crag says, "yeah, I haven't heard much on how it's been going"
Crag says, "I believe it may be"
Crag says, "I'm not sure"
Binder says, "So that each party gets to push it in different directions."
Binder says, "This is the party which is dealing in courtly society, and this is the party which has gone off into the wilderness."
Crag says, "I seem to recall that the two parties are also somewhat antagonistic to each other"
Binder hehs.
Binder says, "Like the Head of Vecna people.  :)"
Crag says, "I'm not familiar with that"
Binder [to Crag]: http://users.tkk.fi/~vesanto/link.fun/stupid.pcs.html
Binder [to Crag]: An oldie but goodie.
Crag takes a look
Binder says, "Hum, there's an Unknown Armies campaign in Japan I was reading about two years ago where the players play both the party and the NPC villains."
Crag says, "ooo, neat"
Binder says, "Because there are only three players, they get to play each others chief nemesiseseses."
Crag says, "nice"
Binder says, "So they each make things worse/harder for each other."
Crag says, "oh dear, this head of vecna thing is hilarious"
Crag says, "I will surely cough up a lung reading this"
Crag says, "oh god.  that's awesome"
Crag says, "that's much better than the UO poisoning story I told stormy about yesterday"
Binder grins.
Binder says, "That one circulates about as much as the Gazebo gaming story."
Binder says, "To the point that it no longer matters if it's true."
Binder says, "It's still freaking hilarious!"
Crag [to Binder]: in UO, Daniel had a master poisoner who would sit in the wilderness, poisoning fruits and vegetables, which the rest of the guild would deposit in strategic locations in town, such as near banks.
Binder LAUGHS.
Binder says, "That's righteous."
Crag says, "People would actually eat the food and die, and the poisoner would get the reputation loss"
Binder says, "That would be even more fun if there were necromancers standing by to raise the dead."
Binder says, "But I don't know enough about UO to know if that's feasible."
Crag says, "Not anymore"
Crag says, "This was in the first few months"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Before they 'fixed' it?"
Crag says, "They close that hole after a month or so"
Crag says, "yeah"
The screen door opens from the other side.
stormagnet arrives from the Forest Clearing.
Crag [to stormagnet]: hi
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm alive
Binder [to stormagnet]: But not for long.
The screen door slams shut.
stormagnet [to Crag]: AW!
Binder [to stormagnet]: I just showed him the Head of Vecna story.
stormagnet [to Binder]: Shush, you
Binder [to stormagnet]: He may rupture something.
Crag ducks and stumbles, falling over.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Don't do it!
Crag [to stormagnet]: too late!
Crag says, "I've read it"
Crag says, "It was most theraputic, actually"
stormagnet closes her eyes and covers her ears
Crag says, "I like the part where the victims blamed the GM"
Binder  :)
Binder has never known THAT to happen.
stormagnet hasn't read it
Crag laughs!
Crag [to stormagnet]: oh you must!
stormagnet [to Crag]: Are you feeling better?
Crag | http://users.tkk.fi/~vesanto/link.fun/stupid.pcs.html
Crag says, "yes, much better"
Crag says, "I spent some time at Hotwire"
Binder says, "Actually, the time that my D&D players killed themselves with a trap, they didn't blame me."
Crag says, "forgot to ask about tea though"
stormagnet shall- carefully, and under controlled use of alcoholic substances
Binder says, "They blamed the player who died first."
stormagnet [to Crag]: Anyway, I had something I needed to paste at you
Binder says, "Uh-oh.  I'm starting to feel the GM itch again."
stormagnet | http://www.unshelved.com/archive.aspx?strip=20060226
stormagnet says, "On an unrelated note"
Crag [to Binder]: In thinking about all my role-playing experiences, it occurs to me that I've enjoyed them more as topology and visualizing terrain mattered more in them.
stormagnet says, "We're studying pragmatics in linguistics class today"
Crag [to Binder]: Excellent
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'the fun-maker'.
Binder says, "Pragmataceuticals."
stormagnet says, "This appears to be the class of linguistic rules that I routinely violate for fun and profit"
Binder LAUGHS at that Unshelved.
stormagnet needs to print it out in a little AA style brochure
Binder [to Crag]: I introduced D & L to 7th Sea CCG.
Binder [to Crag]: The first step down the primrose path to 7th Sea, itself.
Binder says, "Oh, this might interest one or both of you."
Crag [to Binder]: Ahh, good old 7th Sea
Binder says, "To whatever degree you are Penny Arcade fans."
Crag says, "I wish we'd spent more time on that one"
Crag [to Binder]: I'm a pretty big fan
Binder says, "There's a UFS-engine game out for PA."
Crag says, "UFS? (unix file system?)"
Binder says, "Universal Fighting System."
Crag says, "Oh, right"
Crag says, "I had read that PA was working on their own CCG"
Binder says, "It's the game engine from Sabertooth."
Binder says, "This is probably it."
Binder says, "UFS is meant to be a sort of generic universal combat via card system."
stormagnet FEARS and DES
Binder says, "There are a couple incarnations which are [at least in theory] intercompatible."
stormagnet DES
stormagnet says, "GODDAMMIT"
Crag [to stormagnet]: triple DES?
Binder @@
stormagnet [to Crag]: Shift is too close to enter
Binder says, "That is often true."
stormagnet uses the dreaded CAPS-LOCK
Binder ph33rs
Crag says, "OH NOES!"
stormagnet FEARS and DESPISES CCG!!
Binder says, "I guess the game just came out, it's a duel between Beavis & Butthead."
stormagnet says, "THERE"
Binder says, "Or whatever the PA guys' names are."
Binder says, "It's a single release."
Binder says, "No rarity, no other expansions."
Binder says, "You just buy a boxed pack which has two decks and you're done."
Binder says, "D has the game."
Binder says, "He preordered and it came last week."
Binder says, "So fresh out on teh intarwebs."
Binder read the rules and watched D & R play.
Binder says, "Probably the most fun they had were from PA references."
Binder says, "There's some sort of Oneupmanship card with someone growing a beard."
Binder says, "And Unsportsmanlike Conduct, which is someone getting kicked in the ball."
Binder says, "And there's some sort of Golf-related injoke on several cards."
Crag heh
Binder didn't really follow all of that.
Crag says, "Sounds like a highly focused version of chez geek or something"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Crag says, "Niche in-jokes"
stormagnet says, "Well, then"
Binder says, "It's basically two-player Lunch Money."
Binder says, "With PA skinning."
stormagnet says, "What makes the C of CCG?"
Binder says, "If you buy it and don't open it, it'll be a R@R3 L00K!!!11 COLLECTABLE in 2^30^400^6000 years."
Binder says, "Plus it's an edition of UFS."
Binder says, "Meaning that if you love the system, you can buy the other editions."
Binder says, "Like Street Fighter."
stormagnet [to Binder]: Ah, so by that definition, I could probably append a C onto ANYTHING, and then eBay it for fun and profit
stormagnet LIKES fun and profot
Binder says, "And then make Doubleboobs or whoever fight Tycho."
stormagnet . o O ( damn you lag! )
stormagnet . o O ( damn you and your typo cloaking technology! )
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "Collectable Catdish."
Binder says, "Collectable Empty Beer Cans."
stormagnet wants to be The First Kid on her Block
Binder isn't recommending the game.
Binder says, "I'm just saying that if you like PA enough that you'd want to have a game based on it, there's one out."
Crag says, "I think I'll pass on that one"
Binder says, "The lead designer on the CCG was lead designer on the 7th Sea CCG."
Crag says, "I haven't bought their book either"
Binder says, "Attack of the Bacon Robots?"
Crag says, "I'd probably buy Megatokyo stuff before I'd buy PA stuff"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder nods.
Binder also, probably.
Binder says, "And I'd buy Bea Arthur stuff before I bought Megatokyo stuff."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "And I'd buy something I LIKE before I bought Bea Arthur stuff."
Crag says, "Bea Arthur is back!  In pog form!"
Binder  ><
Binder really likes 7th Sea.
Binder is still mad that AEG went to d20 as an engine.
Binder says, "Stupid stupid AEGcreatures."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder hurms.
Binder hurms some more.

The Yurt
You are in a building that is the size of a large gazebo or perhaps a small silo. The exterior is covered in ornately-painted canvas, featuring large yellow, orange, and blue Raffaelesco dragons. Inside, the ceiling is covered in a tessellating pattern made up of turtles.  A lumpy pillow is here.  A fluffy pillow is here.  A blue bean bag is here.  A red bean bag is here.  An Ol'cafe chair is here.  A Taco Stand is here.  A squishy pillow is here.  A rocking chair is here.  Binder is sitting on it.  An oriental rug is here.  The screen door to the Forest Clearing is closed.
You see a quilt chest and a Guido van Rossum here.
Binder is here, daydreaming.  stormagnet is dozing.

Crag says, "it would no longer be possible to get/take, drop, or give annoyances then, though"
Crag says, "Now I'm getting the itch to fix MOO again"
Crag says, "This is Not Getting It Done"
Crag says, "I need to call Nicole and see if she wants to talk about BEM today"
Crag [to stormagnet]: what time are you done with school today?
Binder has much the same issue.
Binder is trying to keep himself on track.
Binder did GREAT this weekend.
Binder got his weekly review done and plowed through a bunch of NA.
Binder says, "So now, of course, I want to jump back off the wagon."
Binder says, "GTD?  Just a crutch!  Who needs it?  Not me!  No sire!"
Crag nods!
Crag pages, "test"
You page Crag, "test"
(to himself) Crag waves
Binder says, "So let's talk about BEM."
Crag says, "Sure"
Binder says, "To help focus your attention."
Binder says, "I prefer my Bug Eyed Monsters to be wearing overalls."
Crag says, "I've been away from it for about a week and a half"
Crag heh
Crag says, "You just have a thing for overalls"
Binder says, "Well."
Binder says, "Can you blame me?"
Crag says, "not really"
Binder says, "Well then."
Binder says, "So processes exist in a space."
Binder says, "And communicate through a ... cell wall?"
Binder says, "Like a membrane?"
Binder says, "This is feeling like studying plant metabolism to me."
Crag says, "yes, where that wall is managed by the 'platform' object hosting the cell in question"
Crag says, "yeah, Nicole made that comparison too"
Binder says, "So the underlying engine knows where the membranes are."
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Collects the osmotic particles?"
Crag says, "It defines them, even"
Binder says, "Or triggers cells to do that?"
Crag says, "The hosting platform creates enough of a reality for the cells to not have to worry about how they interact with each other"
Crag says, "everything to do with communication and resources is handled by the platform"
Binder says, "Including growth/shrink?"
Crag says, "sortof"
Binder says, "ie, if a cell should die does it suicide or does the platform kill it?"
Crag says, "A cell could request death, but has no way to force it"
Binder says, "If the cell needs more resources, does the platform grant it or does it have to negotiate with neighbors?"
Binder pictures a cell with a Please Kill Me button.
Crag says, "The cell can request resources from the platform"
Crag says, "But cells can also trade resources"
Binder says, "Gimme gimme shock treatment."
Binder says, "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today."
Crag says, "Platforms choose to copy or kill cells based on the platform's perception of the cell's vitality"
Binder says, "Including 'space' and 'energy' in this framework?"
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Those who do not meet quotas will be summarily unexecuted!"
Crag says, "But any trading between cells is somewhat hypothetical since their reality is defined by the platform"
Crag says, "The illusion of cell freedom is one which the platforms will tend to support because it makes life easier for them :)"
Binder says, "Yeah, it's a pretty unfree market when one 'party' controls all aspects of the aspiring traders."
Crag says, "But the platforms are defined as not doing anything else"
Binder says, "But I think I get how the platform is like the laws of physics."
Crag says, "right"
Binder says, "Sure, God could cheat but ... why?"
Binder says, "It profits the platform nothing."
Crag says, "that was the intent"
Crag says, "Since the platform competes with other platforms, it's best to treat the cells fairly"
Crag says, "Or other platforms will (probably) succeed more"
Binder says, "Interesting."
Crag says, "I've been trying to move all assumptions to the forefront in this design"
Binder is curious to see how true that turns out.
Crag heh
Crag says, "Me too :)"
Binder says, "I would like to believe that a fair and honest platform would out perform a duplicitous platform, but that's just faith-based reasoning."
Crag says, ""
Binder says, "ie, I want it to be true so all the examples I think of support it."
Crag says, "Let's look at it this way"
Crag says, "What kind of cheating could a platform do that would profit it?"
Crag says, "If it starves its cells they underperform"
Binder says, "Oh, the usual.  Murder, cardsharking, infidelity."
Crag says, "If it pretends to have cells it doesn't, there's no visible difference on the outside."
Crag heh
Crag says, "In fact, I assume that all cells and platforms will try to cheat"
Crag says, "And then I try to figure out how to make it not matter"
Binder says, "What I was envisioning was a distortion of the cellview so that cells were under-rewarded for success to motivate karoshi."
Crag says, "karoshi?"
Binder says, "So all the cells will work themselves to death because, hey, the platform don't care."
Binder says, "It's an affliction of salarimen."
Binder says, "Death through overwork."
Crag says, "Ahh, that wouldn't really be a problem, though"
Crag says, "We have no reason to care about the happiness of cells"
Binder says, "No, not a problem, but it counters my hope that fairdealing profits."
Crag says, "So underreward is only bad if it leads to cell decisions which are not as smart as their peers on other platforms"
Binder says, "Watch, you'll discover that feudal oppression is the winning strategy."
Crag says, "That may be"
Crag says, "But I wouldn't really call it cheating then"
Binder says, "I've said it before, I'll say it again, Democracy simply doesn't work."
Binder says, "Overall, no.  But within the context of the platform reality, the platform would be lying to the cells."
Binder says, "Which I see as a kind of cheating."
Crag says, "Ah, that's true"
Binder says, "Under-rewarding, over-demanding."
Crag says, "But if the cells are operating with limited information that will impede their function"
Binder says, "Which isn't material, it doesn't impact your premise, it just makes me curious."
Crag says, "Also, if they are underfed, they will be illequipped to compete in the greater market"
Crag says, "A well-fed platform will be more resiliant to surprises"
Binder says, "I would like to think so."
Crag says, "It's all speculation at this point, of course"
Binder says, "Of course!"
Binder says, "That's the point of talking about it."
Binder says, "To incite you to implement it."
Crag says, "And we're probably a year away from running an actual simulation"
Binder says, "To prove me wrong.  :)"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "Or right, as the case may be"
Binder says, "Either way, completed project."
Binder fixes a bash script by changing #!/bin/bash to #!/bin/perl

The Yurt
You are in a building that is the size of a large gazebo or perhaps a small silo. The exterior is covered in ornately-painted canvas, featuring large yellow, orange, and blue Raffaelesco dragons. Inside, the ceiling is covered in a tessellating pattern made up of turtles.  A lumpy pillow is here.  A fluffy pillow is here.  A blue bean bag is here.  A red bean bag is here.  An Ol'cafe chair is here.  You are sitting on it.  A Taco Stand is here.  A squishy pillow is here.  A rocking chair is here.  Binder is sitting on it.  An oriental rug is here.

Binder [to Crag]: TMDA frightens and confuses Some Recipients.
Binder [to Crag]: Do you find it still useful?
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "The alternative would be a lot more work"
Crag says, "TMDA holds and rejects hundreds of messages a day"
Crag says, "And I've gotten no negative feedback"
Crag says, "gotten?"
Crag says, "is that even a word?"
Crag says, "I have had people be confused, but nobody has complained"
Crag says, "now, I'm not _satisfied_, either"
Crag says, "I want TMDA to be a last resort, not an only resort"
Crag says, "I want a combination of SPF, blackholes and SpamAssassing"
Binder says, "The thing that concerns me about TMDA is the prospect of joe-job triggered DoS."
Crag says, "yes, that bothers me too"
Binder says, "My boss complains about getting TMDA bombed because it's happened to him."
Binder says, "But he complains to me, not to the recipient-domain."
Crag says, "Sure"
Crag says, "But what would the recipient do about it?  Turn of TMDA?  Not likely."
Crag says, "The real solution is the multi-factor thing"
Crag says, "but I just don't have the time right now"
Binder says, "The real solution is to kill spammers."
Crag says, "that's not realistic"
Binder says, "Since we can't remove the financial incentive to spam, we must exact punishment."
Crag heh
Crag says, "If TMDA only challenged senders which got past RBLs, SPF and for which the answer from SpamAssassin was sufficiently vague, it would be used very rarely indeed"
Crag says, "And in colaboration with other email agents it could reduce the number of challenges sent globally"
Crag says, "But that's a LONG way off"
Crag says, "My TMDA shouldn't be challenging more than one or two senders a month."
Binder says, "Yeah, I'm just not convinced TMDA solves any of the real problems."
Crag says, "I think it does"
Binder says, "My biggest problem is not people using valid from addresses to send me email I don't want to see."
Crag says, "obviously it doesn't solve THAT problem"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Not exactly, anyway"
Binder says, "What problem do you see TMDA solving?"
Crag says, "It does prevent you from receiving those messages"
Binder says, "Actually, I can think of a problem TMDA would solve for me."
Crag says, "It solves the problem of senders with legitimate SPF records sending messages but not responding to replies."
Binder says, "I could set it up and tell it to quarantine and query-sender only emails received from family/friends which look like chain email forwards."
Binder says, "That'd teach them."
Crag heh
Crag says, "You could do that without TMDA, too."
Crag says, "but TMDA would handle the releasing for you"
Crag says, "But today what TMDA does for me is handle the fact that I don't have SPF setup"
Binder says, "So TMDA for bulk semi-legit email."
Binder says, "Say, WDIG spam."
Crag says, "Or rather, I don't have my MTA setup to verify SPF records for inbound mail"
Crag says, "ideally, yes."
Crag says, "Which I admit I do not get a lot of"
Binder says, "Or things like that, where it's a big company, which has SPF, but still insists on spamming you."
Crag says, "right"
Binder says, "Like Yahoo Travel in my real world situation."
Crag says, "Sure"
Binder says, "Pretty rare for me, though."
Crag says, "Technically we probably COULD un-subscribe, but that won't keep them from re-using the address on another list"
Binder says, "But I don't have a popular domain."
Binder says, "Like if I hosted four-five domains with ~20 users each, I can see it being a bigger problem."
Crag nods
Binder says, "If those users have shared interests which would provoke legal-spam."
Binder says, "ie, they all subscribe to MSDN or somesuch."
Crag says, "And even then, it really should be a last resort and it needs to be tied in to the user's email program so that if they send someone a message that person is automatically whitelisted"
Binder is really intrigued by autograylisting.
Crag says, "The other neat thing about TMDA is the ability to set sunsets on email addresses"
Crag says, "So one can post to a mailing list from an address which will be unfilitered (by TMDA at least) for a day or a week or something"
Binder says, "postgrey for postfix in Linux and spamd in *BSD do this thing where they'll automatically return a temporary failure error to a sender the first time they see email from it and then accepta  retry."
Crag says, "And after that messages to that address are suspect or whatever."
Crag says, "Yes, I remember you mentioning that"
Crag says, "I like that idea too"
Binder says, "Capitalizing on most spammers only sending once and legit MTAs will queue and retry."
Binder says, "Yeah, email sunsetting is something I would like to do, as would Vy."
Crag says, "Adds latency, but in conjunction with other methods that would be an acceptable price"
Binder says, "ie, use this address to book plane tickets online but /dev/null anything it gets a month later and beyond."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "And it only happens the first time for the sender.  So if it's someone you correspond with regularly, there's no latency."
Binder says, "It predicates that strangers suck more than friends."
Crag says, "Or even better, after a month, report senders as suspicious or something"
Binder says, "blacklist them."
Crag nods.
Binder goes What The?! at an email alert via cypherpunks tribe.
Binder says, "Tutors ... in the state of ... Delaware ... okay."
Binder . o O ( how is this cryptorelated? )
Crag heh
Binder says, "OK, I still don't see a need to deploy TMDA for myself."
Binder says, "I just periodically revisit the idea."
Binder says, "I like automation but it doesn't solve any of my existing real problems."
Binder says, "And it worries me that it could cause problems for other people."
Crag says, "yeah, it only solves my problems because I don't have spam assassin setup"
Crag says, "Oh hey, you're not using SA on wrack anymore, right?"
Crag says, "If so, I could set it up to run generically now"
Crag says, "Then I could tell TMDA to auto blacklist stuff above a threshold and autowhitelist stuff below a threshold."
Binder says, "Yes.  That's true."
Binder has discontinued using SA on wrack.
Crag says, "excellent"
Binder says, "The ONLY activity you should see by me on wrack with any regularity is a .qmail forward which bounces anything I get there back out to me at fool."
Binder says, "Though I do occasionally log in to try traceroutes from that point to other nets."
Binder says, "So I'm grateful for shell access."
Crag says, "That's fine"
Crag says, "The important thing is that nobody be counting on wrack's stability"
Crag says, "I'm not pulling anyone's access, just encouraging people to find stability elsewhere"
Crag says, "I only have two guests left to shoo away"
Binder finds stability through drinking.
Crag . o O ( that might not be stability... )
Binder . o O ( but not for the reason you think )

Binder went through the effort to reformat that and then pasted the wrong thing.
Binder says, "But I guess you can see the numbers well enough."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "That's the postgray thing I talked about."
Crag says, "I'm trying to get spamd integrated into qmail via qmail-scanner now"

Binder says, "You've protected me!"
Binder [to Crag]: My hero!
Binder swoons.
Crag heh
Binder says, "You'll probably see a lot of that."
Crag says, "I'm sure"
Binder says, "In fact, nearly every single email for me that comes through wrack will be spam."
Binder says, "By virtue of spammers preferring secondary mx as an attack path."
Crag says, "naturally"
Crag says, "I wish I could use that information against them."
Binder says, "Rick Moen had an idea to do just that."
Crag says, "I probably could if I bothered to figure it out"
Crag says, "oh yeah, I remember you mentioning that too"
Binder says, "Set up a spurious secondary MX and just /dev/null anything it gets."
Binder says, "Or use it to submit to razordb or the moral equivalent."
Binder says, "Or tarpit it all."
Crag says, "I like tarpit+razor"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "It hits back at spammers."
Binder says, "Go ahead.  Spam my mx.  I DARE you."
Crag says, "I think a combination of all these methods ought to be sufficient until everyone is signing all their emails."
Binder says, "Speaking of."
Binder says, "I am going to be making an effort to be more aggressive in my use of gpg."
Crag says, "I've been meaning to do that for like 8 years"
Binder is already signing-by-default.
Crag says, "I need to create a non dig.com keypair"
Crag says, "and learn to maintain it"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I'm afraid to start using gpg because I'm not very good at discipline in general"
Binder says, "Maybe GTD lists can help you there."
Crag says, "And sometimes bad security can be worse than none"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "I haven't GTD since I got sick"
Binder says, "Well, for you, yes.  On the whole, maybe not."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder says, "Bad security by you might induce other people to be better about it."
Binder says, "They see you signing email, they'll look into crypto."
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Except I'm liable to lose/forget important stuff"
Crag says, "And then I won't be able to send mail until I either turn off signing or make a new key, or whatever"
Binder hmms.
Binder says, "I can think of a couple supplementary techology fixes."
Binder says, "Er, technology."
Crag says, "I pretty much know what I should do"
Binder says, "But it's a hassle?"
Crag says, "I should make my key and phrase, write them down and put them in a physical safe"
Crag says, "yes"
Binder is trying to think of how to dehassle the process.
Crag says, "I have USB memory devices which can help"
Binder says, "Too bad biometrics suck."
Crag says, "seriously"
Binder says, "Too bad OTP fobs are big $$."
Crag says, "What I should really do is just get over myself"
Crag says, "If I Just Do It, it'll get easier"
Crag says, "And I'll figure out ways to make it easier"
Crag says, "I'm just being a big pussy about it is all"
Binder says, "Plus it'll make for topological obscenity."
Crag heh
Binder says, "The other day Devlyn_Syde @ pegasusMUCK was telling me why he doesn't use del.icio.us."
Crag snorts
Binder says, "He doesn't want other people to know what sites he's visiting."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "And it occurred to me that it would be pretty easy to build a 'noise' system."
Binder says, "Which randomly visits URLs in the background."
Binder says, "Del.icio.us marks them."
Binder says, "Makes random host queries to exercise DNS."
Binder says, "Looks up mx hosts and initiates spurious interacts with them."
Binder says, "Basically generate a whole lot of traffic noise to mask whatever it is one is really doing."
Binder says, "You could even give it a learning mode."
Binder says, "Watch what I do, then do more stuff like it."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "What would be more entertaining to me would be to hide information in that noise :)"
Binder says, "Steganography in the Static."
Crag says, "Use the widdle/chaffe thing or whattever it's called"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder nods.
Crag . o O ( Rivest is a genius )
Binder says, "Depending upon how far one wanted to take it [ie, spend money on it] one could have the noise system 'buy' random things."
Binder says, "To confuse consumer profiling."
Binder says, "Hmm, subscribes to Ebony, donates to the KKK, visits flylady.net daily, and keeps bookmarking porn sites, WHAT?!"
Binder says, "If I get ambitious maybe I'll write enough of it to encrypt random text and email it to you."
Binder says, "So you can write a script to automatically decrypt and generate a randomr esponse."
Binder says, "That'd be a useless waste of time!"
Binder high5s himself with the Big Hand of Stupid.

Crag laughs
Crag [to Binder]: I turned off TMDA to see if SA is sufficient
Binder nods.
Binder has found SA to be pretty darned accurate.
Binder says, "Especially with some .user_prefs tuning."
Binder says, "To blacklist_to known compromised addresses."
Crag says, "I haven't even done any tuning yet"
Binder says, "And blacklist_from people WHO I HATE DRUGSTOREDOTCOM I AM LOOKING AT YOU."
Crag laughs!
Binder says, "It's about 75% accurate without any tuning, in my experience."
Binder says, "And its inaccuracies are false negatives, not false positives."
Binder says, "It lets through spam, it doesn't filter out goodmail."
Crag says, "THat's pretty good"
Binder says, "Yeah, given that it's been around for years and is open and so spammers have had all this time to build a better mouseanus."
Crag . o O ( build a better mouse anus and ... people will beat a uh... path to uh... your... backdoor? )
Binder says, "That's about the size of it.  Build a better mouseanus and people will eat your shit."
Crag says, "mouseanus would be a good band name"

Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm requesting the entire week of April 23rd off
Crag [to stormagnet]: and I'm going to go to band practice instead of watching The Matrix with you tonight.  I think it'll be better for my recovery for me to do so.  But we can spend some time together for the hour before practice, of course.
Crag [to Binder]: I found out why I didn't get a flood of got.net spam: got.net is using an effective spam filtering system which emails a daily summary of quarenteened messages to its users.
Binder [to Crag]: That'd be especially effective if it quarantined 100% of emails received.
Binder [to Crag]: "I have received 200 emails for you and YOU CAN'T HAVE 'EM!"
Crag grins.

HELP ON THE GENERIC FEATURE OBJECT
==================================

The Generic Feature Object--not to be used as a feature object.

using this
==========

Proper usage for the Generic Feature Object:

Make a short description.  The :look_msg automatically includes a pointer to `help <this object>', so you don't have to.

Put a list of the commands you want people to use in <this object>.feature_verbs.  When someone types `help <this object>', they will be told the comment strings from each of the verbs named in .feature_verbs.

When you add or remove command verbs, you'll have to `@fix-commands <this object>' before they will be recognized correctly.

When you're ready, `@reg <this object>' to enter it in the feature registry.

Binder says, "That's it, time to rest on my laurels."
Binder . o O ( mmm, Laurel. )
Crag grins.
Crag . o O ( how many Laurels does he... have? )
Binder says, "Enough."
Crag [to Binder]: Mr. Binder.  How many Laurels does it take to get to the chewy center of a uh... nevermind.
Binder says, "Oh man!  I was hoping someone would ask me that!"
Crag laughs!
Binder hmms.
Binder says, "Intel MacMini is now available from apple store."
Binder may well have bought one of the last PPC MacMini's in the Eville store.
Binder says, "Only real upgrade from my POV is double RAM capacity, from max 1G to 2G."
Binder says, "Which is to say:  I don't think I care very much at all."
Binder considers a move from PPC to Intel a step backward.
Binder says, "Now, if the MacMini ran AMD, they'd have my interest."
Binder is only yammering on about this because his boss is doing so.

Binder says, "My boss is continuing to try to induce me to spend money."
Binder says, "I fought off the Apple pitch but now he reminded me about t..g.....com."
Binder has to close the page before he remembers he got paid today.
Binder twiddles his thumbs.
Crag heh
Binder stabs Binder with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder says, "Sometimes I can't believe me."
Binder says, "So I wanted to be able to do some budgeting."
Binder says, "Try to anticipate what my check would look like once I was having medical/401k/taxes taken out of it."
Binder says, "So I put together a spreadsheet."
Binder says, "Calculated percentages and set it up."
Binder says, "Got my paystub today and compared the numbers.'"
Binder says, "Not the same."
Binder says, "So I changed all my percentages."
Binder says, "And suddenly I realize, the reason they're different/wrong is because I'm not yet seeing 401k taken out."
Binder says, "So of COURSE the numbers aren't the same."
Binder says, "That comes out pretax and will affect what the value is for a given percent."
Binder says, "And of course, I made all those edits and then saved it again."
Binder says, "So now I have to go back and undo it all by recalculating the percentages."
Binder sighs.
Binder says, "How curious."
Binder says, "This check shows no sign of my medical coverage deduction."
Binder says, "Which is good and bad."
Binder says, "Good in that I made more money than expected."
Binder says, "Bad in that I would expect to be paying for medical insurance by now."
Binder hurms.
Binder says, "Maybe they'll catch up on the next check and just bill me double."
Binder debates skipping the Perl UG tonight.
Binder twiddles his thumbs.
Crag [to Binder]: budgeting frightens and confuses me
Binder [to Crag]: Budgeting is easy.
Binder [to Crag]: For me.
Binder [to Crag]: Because I use Tricks.
Binder [to Crag]: Apropos nothing:  http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp/2002/11/msg00167.html
Binder was looking for tools to turn a djbdns data file into a bind zone file and found that email.
Binder [to Crag]: It's like Clash of the Assholes.
Binder [to Crag]: Would you like to hear some of my budget Tricks or would it trigger your peril-sensitive sunglasses?
Binder snickers.
Binder says, "Among the several near-miss domain names my employer has registered:  playfist.com."
Binder hmms.
Binder | http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/smtp-spf-is-harmful.html
Crag says, "That debian-isp post re-affirms my loyalty to DJB"
Crag snorts
Crag | SPF usurps the meaning of an existing and widely used DNS resource record type for its own purposes
Crag says, "The TXT record?"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure TXT records are NOT widely used for anything"
Crag says, "And adding a RR type for SPF would almost certainly break lots of currently working DNS software"
Crag says, "wow, that anti-SPF (so adopt it) page is wrong in so many ways"
Crag says, "well, off to work"
Crag yawns
Crag [to stormagnet]: I installed virus filtering software on wrack to protect your mom. :)
Binder . o O ( by blocking her from receiving all packets. )
Binder . o O ( from anywhere )
Binder says, "Yeah, I read that debian-isp thread in its entirety and my opinion was: I don't miss Craig Sanders at ALL and I wish people would stop antagonizing djb."
Binder says, "My two TWO opinions were:  Craig Sanders is an ASS; I don't miss him at all; djb is a better coder than he is at ignoring trolling"
Binder says, "My three!  THREE!  AMONGST MY MANY OPINIONS ARE SUCH ELEMENTS AS."
Binder says, "Also, I went to SF Perl UG last night and the topic was Perl IDEs."
Binder . o O ( why would you DO that? )
Binder feels a temptation renewed to use emacs.
Crag says, "perl... IDEs?  That sounds dirty to me"
Crag says, "I wish I could install emacs knowledge in my brain without actually going through the work of learning it"
Binder says, "You need an extension framework in your mind."
Binder says, "The three Perl IDEs presented were: perlnow, epic and komodo."
Binder says, "perlnow is an enhancement/replacement for the emacs major mode, perl-mode."
Binder says, "It does syntax highlighting and has several helper functions to do perlish things without leaving emacs."
Binder says, "epic is an extension for the Eclipse IDE."
Binder says, "Eclipse has an extension framework to extend it to do more than Java project editing and epic is an extension which is Perl aware."
Binder says, "So it's a clicky GUI thing.  It does syntax highlighting, syntax checking, method browsing and minor method refactoring [ie, extract into method]."
Binder says, "Komodo is the only commercial one demonstrated."
Binder says, "It's ActiveState's IDE."
Binder says, "It was designed from the ground up for Perl, it was written while both Larry Wall and Guido von Rossum were on ActiveState's payroll."
Binder says, "So it also does Python and has more recently been extended to do Ruby."
Binder says, "It aligns along several scripting principles from the inside out and groud up."
Binder says, "Which is to say, it feels right [assuming you are mouse-friendly] and looks wrong [assuming you hate Visual Studio] because it was meant to woo MSFT people away from Visual Studio and the VB to ActiveState and Perl/Python."
Binder says, "It also has tightly couple tutorials and hinting because it was expected that people who bought it would have no prior experience."
Binder says, "So if you want to spend ~$400 to learn Perl/Python/Ruby in a familiar-to-you-as-a-MSFT-"coder", it's a hell of a deal."
Binder says, "One thing it has that perlnow and epic do not:  RegEx helper."
Binder says, "Text box to define a RE, and you can do it by drag-drop atoms or typing it or copying it from somewhere else.  Text box to blurt sample text into.  It will evaluate the RE and highlight the text in box 2 which is matched."
Binder says, "Can be an enormous boon for things like:  I have 1000000 lines of Apache log output, I want to find lines which contain interesting information, I really don't want to have to hand-tune my RE and feed it these long log lines over and over to find the winning RE."
Binder says, "You put some lines in box 2 which should match, some which don't, start with what you know about the RE, refine it."
Binder says, "I am getting kind of tweaked that so many people in this area throw up their hands in the face of interesting problems with this catechism:  in order to solve this problem, we'd need to solve the halting problem and that is impossible."
Binder says, "I parse that as:  I am lazy and looking for a way to avoid thinking about this problem so I am construing it in a manner which will let me throw my hands up in dismay and ignore it."
Binder says, "To wit:  there was a consensus last night that being able to automate any part of RE generation would require solving the halting problem."
Binder says, "OK, sure, maybe, for all cases, ever."
Binder says, "But for the situations most people will WANT to do it?  Not nearly, is my intuition."
Binder says, "But I may have to shut up and code it to win that dispute."
Binder sits on the rocking chair.
Binder kicks his heels up and rocks out.
Binder says, "Nice.  Godaddy bulk update by my grandboss took our infrastructure domain off the net."
Binder says, "Between the three of us we break more networks than anybody."
Binder says, "Aaaaand just as we're fixing it, the Marketing lady walks in and asks if, um, the, like, printer is, like, color?  Because she, you know, wants to print?  Something?  In color?"
Binder shoos her away.
Devil says, "try it and find out, biotch!"
Binder says, "I like that we spend a day discussing all sorts of interesting matters."
Binder says, "You wake up from idle."
Binder says, "To yell at the Marketeer."
Binder gives Devil an xp for 'damn marketeers'.
Binder [to Crag]: givexp hates when I try to use an aware which includes a prepositional clause.
Binder [to Crag]: An aware?  An AWARD.
Crag [to Binder]: Excellent Perl IDE summary
Crag says, "I'm convinced that vim+screen is all I need"
Crag says, "Though the regexp tool sounds awesome"
Crag says, "Worth doing as a side tool in fact"

    #6:givexp                   Core-Wizard (#184)   r d    any at/to any
-------------------------------- finished ---------------------------------
Crag [to Binder]: if you want givexp to tolerate prepositions you'll have to change it to 'any any any' and modify the code to parse the argstr
Crag says, "because MOO is retarded"
Crag says, "It thinks "verb some string with a preposition in it to indirectobject" doesn't match "any to any""
Crag says, "At least, I assume that's the problem"
Try this instead:  givexp testing to prepositions to me
Crag says, "yeah, that's the problem"
Crag sighs
Devil says, "Yes. That regex tool sounds really handy.  esp for people like me who are bad at regex"
Crag gives Crag an xp for 'testing with prepositions'.
"YOu" is not the name of any player.
Crag says, "YOu can quote the award with double quotes to get around the problem"
Crag says, "I think I'm good at regex and I think I'd find it useful"
Crag says, "I might just right a tool anyway for the fun of it :P"
Crag says, "but not today"
Devil . o O ( didn't i do some regex example thing at some point )
Devil says, "i did! In perl. shockingly"
Devil says, "y'all wanna see?"

Crag says, "And not because I can't read it.  I can read Forth, Lisp isn't much different."
Binder says, "Well, Perl Syntax + Lisp Concepts =~ Ruby."
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "Maybe it's time to take the ruby plunge then"
Binder says, "But there's no language I know if which has a CPAN like resource."
Devil says, "I found the lession. I doesn'n mention the tab conversion, but Binder's right.  It does also mention that one should feed the re in in "s"
Crag says, "Ruby might catch up.  The Perl and Ruby communities seem to be pretty lovey-dovey"
Binder <- right
Binder says, "Would you like to hear a scary idea?"
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag [to Binder]: Sure
left -> Crag
Binder says, "Joe Brenner is calling for an elisp layer for the parrot engine."
Binder says, "So that you could ... wait for it ..."
Binder says, "Rewrite emacs as a front end to Parrot."
Binder faints from panic and horror.
Crag ..
Crag says, "Well..."
Devil says, "what's Parrot?"
Binder says, "THEN."
Crag [to Devil]: VM for Perl 6
Binder says, "You make it an entire OS."
Crag [to Binder]: Oh, that always comes up in conversations about Emacs
Binder says, "Yeah, it's the Godwin's Law of Emacs."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "What's the generic name for those kinds of relations: it's the X of Y"
Crag says, "It's not an analogy"
Crag says, "parallel?"
Crag . o O ( and why does my computer keep beeping at me )
Binder . o O ( the beeping means it's working )
Crag . o O ( it's Windows, it can't be working too well )
Crag says, "I need to download VMware on this machine pronto"
Crag says, "no, not pronto, that other word: next week"
Binder says, "Yeah, I think parallel describes the relationship expressed there."
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'parallel'.
Binder says, "Isn't pronto the lone ranger's indian friend?"
Crag says, "Only the Lone Ranger thought they were friends. :)"
Binder says, "The ranger's lone indian friend?"
Crag says, "And how Lone could he be if he kept hanging out with Tonto all the time?"
Binder [to Devil]: When I say Parrot, you should hear it as: Perl version Six.
Crag . o O ( Wasn't Tonto the dog in The Wizard Of Oz? )
Crag [to Devil]: I have lots of perl links if you're interested.
Binder . o O ( no, Tonto is a city in Canada, you're thinking of Tomato. )
Crag says, "What?  I thought Tomato was the day after today?"
Binder says, "Something something."
Binder wonders what he came back to say.
Binder whines that he doesn't have a focus-follows-gaze UI for X.
Crag [to Binder]: that would be nice
Devil says, "SURPISE! YOU'RE DEAD!"
Crag says, "I love that song"
Devil says, "I just got the album again, along with King For A Day/Fool for a lifetime and Album of the Year"
Crag says, "Is that the one with We Care A Lot on it?"
Devil says, "I need to give KFD/FFL and AoY more listenings, but i think Angel Dust is stil my favorite"
Devil says, "no, that's Introduce Yourself. With the first singer, befor Patton joined"
Crag says, "Oh, I didn't know that wasn't Patton."
Crag says, "I thought he was just very young."
Crag says, "I think I like AotY best."
Crag says, "Then Angel Dust"
Crag says, "BE.  AGGRESSIVE."
Crag says, "I love AotY because of the immense size of some of the songs."
Devil [to Crag]: http://www.fnm.com/band/index.html
Crag says, "The whole thing just feels very clean to me."
Crag heh
Crag gets edjumacation
Devil [to Crag]: that's got all the lineup changes
Crag . o O ( how many Mikes do they need? )
Crag says, "I didn't know Courney Love sang for them either"
Crag says, "Was she any good?"
Crag says, "Did they record with her?"
Devil says, "I doubt it and I dont think so"
Crag heh
Crag says, "That woman is full of surprises."
Binder says, "She has the power to cloud musician's minds."
Crag says, "I wouldn't call her a tallented musician, but I would call her an entertaining person."
Binder says, "To her face?"
Devil says, "That would have been after she fled the Mpls punk scene after ripping off ... the babes in toyland girs"
Crag says, "I was in the turkey the WHOLE TIME!"
Crag . o O ( I love Gir! )
Binder desperately would like to be high right now.
Crag [to Binder]: I can't help you with that.
Binder can help himself with that.
Binder would just need to leave this place and go to another place.  A place with drugs.
Crag [to Binder]: However, you might look into meditation as a means of accomplishing your goals in situations where drugs are not practical.
Binder . o O ( like thailand )
Binder [to Crag]: Yeah, been there, done that.
Devil [to Binder]: Truxton tonight at BotH
Crag [to Binder]: Not all it's cracked up to be?
Binder [to Crag]: It's differently good.
Crag says, "H"
Crag says, "Hm, even"
Binder [to Crag]: Meditation rules.  Drugs rule.  Different ways.
Crag says, "Makes sense."
Binder [to Devil]: I think tonight I'm going to go home
Binder [to Devil]: And try to finish Baten Kaitos.
Devil [to Binder]: sound good
Binder [to Devil]: So that I can move on to a game which I WANT to play.
Crag says, "I want to get into meditation at some point, amongst the many other things I'd like to get into."
Binder . o O ( burnout burnout burnout burnout! )
Binder says, "Meditation is something you can do on your own."
Binder says, "There's like umpteenbrazilian good books on techniques."
Binder says, "Public library will have 'em."
Binder says, "You'll find pages on the web with helpful hints."
Binder says, "I need to also do some inbox processing."
Binder says, "It's so full I can't wait for my WR on Saturday."
Binder stares at his fish.
Binder sits on his hands.
Binder says, "Here."
Binder finds a stellar HOWTO.
Binder [to Crag]: http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/howto/htmeditate.htm
Binder says, "Simple.  No frippery."
Binder says, "Once you're comfortable with the basics you can modify it to your needs."
Binder says, "Like self-guided visualization or targeted mantra or whatever you want out of it."
Binder LAUGHS.
Binder says, "Here's a howto for another style of meditation which I find to be more difficult but easier to integrate with other stuff:"
Binder says, "http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/howto/htmindful.htm"
Binder says, "The LAUGH part of this is that there's a typo in the <title> of that page."
Crag back
Binder  front
Crag [to Binder]: fish?
Crag hms at meditation howto
Crag . o O ( that's it? )
Binder [to Crag]: http://flickr.com/photos/stp/106480848/
Binder [to Crag]: Fish.
Crag says, "Nice"
Crag says, "Chris Launey has something like that"
Binder says, "Yah.  It's just a little toy Vy packed in my lunchy today."
Binder says, "She asked me if I was taking good care of them so I filled it with water and took a camphone picture."
Crag says, "hee hee"
Crag says, "Don't neglect your toy fish!"
Crag says, "I kinda like how fish is both singular and plural"
Crag says, "I wish english were more regular though"
Binder doesn't.
Binder loves loves loves organic creations.
Binder just found out about rt.cpan.org
Crag says, "Interesting"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Binder was looking at Dns::Zoneparse and saw a link to the rt queue for it.
Crag [to Binder]: You're doing a terrible job of helping me focus on BEM. :)
Binder [to Crag]: Oh, man, I did that job YESTERDAY.
Binder [to Crag]: AND you're supposed to be at WORK today thinking about WORK.
Binder [to Crag]: So what's broken at WDIG today?
Binder goes insane, eats chocolate.
Binder sends http://homepages.tesco.net/~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/when-hell-freezes-over-means-now.html to Princess QA when she says that it'll be cold in QA when hell freezes over.
Binder <- dick
Binder says, "Oh."
Binder says, "Another thing."
Binder says, "Which no Perl IDE does."
Binder says, "But which several people would like to see."
Binder says, "Visualization of complex data structures."
Binder says, "ie, draw me this list-of-lists and, as I step through the code, update it to reflect what's stored where in it."
Binder says, "Many of the more vocal vi-is-my-IDE crowd use the Perl debugger mode for that sort of thing but said they'd use an IDE which gave them that feature."
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Whenever I hear about features like that my first thought is that if it's that complicated that's your problem"
Crag says, "But I'm funny that way"
Crag [to Binder]: And not much exciting is broken at WDIG today
Crag says, "I've been wasting my entire day"
Crag says, "I only have one thing I absolutely have to do, it should take me a few minutes and I've been working on it for hours."
Crag says, "And I use the phrase "working on it" loosely."
Binder HAHS.
Binder <- vindicated
Binder | There is another caveat. The undecidability of the halting problem relies on the fact that algorithms are assumed to have potentially infinite storage: at any one time they can only store finitely many things, but they can always store more and they never run out of memory. However, computers that actually exist are not equivalent to a Turing machine but instead to a linear bounded automaton, as their memory and external storage of a machine is limited. In this case, the halting problem for programs running on that machine can be solved with a very simple general algorithm (albeit one that is so inefficient that it could never be useful in practice). It involves running the program and trying to find a cycle over the states of the machine's memory.
Crag says, "nice"
Binder says, "So while, yes, several classes of algorithms are quite possibly undecidable, it doesn't mean they can't be coded for."
Binder says, "Because within the limits of available storage and cycles, yes, they can be computed."
Binder says, "Or at least an approximation of a specific solution can be computed."
Binder says, "For example, to demonstrate that a given RE does or does not match target text is not a suitable reason to invoke the halting problem."
Binder says, "Because while my apache log may be vast indeed, it must be contained by my storage space."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "She's got huge... logs of web traffic!"
Binder says, "Yesssssss."

Crag grr spelling
Binder casts spells.
Crag says, "There's a band from Japan on KEXP if you're into that kind of thing"
Crag says, "Don't know what kind of band they are yet"
Binder says, "Japanese!"
Binder says, "Clearly."
Crag says, "Need a link?"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "They are a Japanese band, defying description as one might expect"
Crag says, "rock, punk, techno, disco, ... DDR music."
Crag says, "sortof"
Binder hehs.
Crag says, "Those crazy Japanese!"
Binder says, "They cast a wide net."
Crag says, "My friend's domain 'bagofshit.org' expires in a month"
Crag says, "he's had it for four years"
Binder says, "It's probably pretty ripe shit by now."
Crag says, "I should give him a call"
Binder says, "And call him a bagofshit!"
Crag grins
Crag says, "So now that I'm getting my got.net mail again I'm finding that my got.net addresses are still in use, sortof"
Crag says, "I have got a distributed.net mailing list membership reminder"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I haven't given that address out on purpose since mid-2001"
Binder says, "Whoa."
Binder says, "Wild."
Binder says, "When I revived popess, I found it was trying to run the dnet client."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Man, I wonder how much faster machines at my disposal now are than the ones I had access to in '01"
Binder says, "I guess people who used to do dnetc now do boinc."
Crag says, "I'm not doing anything with my spare resources until BEM takes off :)"
Crag says, "THen I will devote most of my spare resources to that, naturally"
Crag says, "dogfood and all that"
Binder . o O ( mmm dogfood )
Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: you are a crazy motherfucker :)
Crag says, "Hrm"
Crag says, "Reading DWN, about the ftp.debian.org mirror split"
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
    What this means to you:

         (a) if you are mirroring from ftp.debian.org, and are happy to
             only mirror the mainstream architectures, just keep doing
             what you're currently doing. Your Debian mirror will drop
             back from 170GB to about 90-100GB in a few weeks time.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Crag says, "That's only an order of magnatude in base 2.  I wouldn't think it would be worthwhile to make the change for just the size in half (almost)"
Crag says, "I'm not against it or anything, I'm just confused."
Crag says, "I wonder what the bandwidth change will be"
Binder says, "Well."
Binder says, "This is merely phase two."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Of what is roughly five."
Crag says, "Oh, I didn't know that"
Binder says, "The later three will increase the size of the architecture specific streams."
Crag says, "I've been focusing on Perl 6 so much that I've not kept up on Debian stuff"
Binder says, "So they're splitting now so that it stays at < 150GB for any given single architecture."
Crag says, "I see"
Binder says, "As opposed to it being 900GB to mirror base."
Binder says, "It's a preemptive split."
Crag says, "I didn't realize the plan was developed that fully"
Crag says, "That makes sense then"
Crag says, "better to do it now"
Binder says, "Yeah, it's why it's been so slow in happening."
Binder says, "This is something I was hearing about back in 99."
Crag says, "I must have been ignoring those posts when I was reading mailing list archives"
Crag says, "not surprising, really.  I ignore a lot."
Binder says, "Yeah, it was mostly in the debian-hurd lists."
Binder says, "Because, from their POV, they wanted [a] equal citizenship in the Debian project & [b] to not have to mirror stuff they couldn't use."
Crag says, "I see that the archives for the debian-mirrors lists goes back to 99 :)"
Binder says, "You'll probably be able to search for 'split' or 'hurd' and find traffic there."
Crag nods
Crag says, "I'm just going to browse the recent debian-mirrors archives for now"
Crag says, "Actually, I should go meet stormy now"
Crag hm
Binder says, "I think I like the idea of software sources being a tiny bit like RSS feeds."
Binder says, "So one could browse some subset of them."
Binder says, "And 'weight' them differently, or tag them."
Binder says, "And combine several small streams into a repository definition."
Crag says, "kinda like the pool thing taken much farther"
Binder says, "ie, I am very interested in gcc related libraries, less interested in GNOME, not at all interested in KDE."
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "I like that idea a lot"
Binder says, "It's a lot of overhead for a gain very few could see."
Binder says, "But maybe it will trend that way."
Crag says, "yeah, but there might be a way to trim that overhead"
Crag says, "or yeah, maybe it'll just go that way as you say"
Binder is patient.
Binder is cunning.
Crag grins.
Binder is waiting for a goat to cross his bridge.
Binder . o O [ trip trap trip trap ]
Crag says, "trip trap, trip trap?"
Crag loses
Binder <- winner
Try this instead:  givexp word square cheater to
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'word square cheater (but to good effect)'.
Binder says, "I am in the Merlin Mann camp of IMAP lovers."
Binder says, "I would like all data resources to be browseable and groupable and stored in a way I can view from independent clients and make changes and see those changes in my other client."
Binder says, "RSS is like one-way IMAP."
Binder says, "podcasting, and other enclosures, also."
Crag says, "I'm in that camp too"
Crag says, "ANd I don't like one-way stuff"
Binder says, "One of my m/s projects is to overload the IMAP protocol to have a 'contacts' folder."
Crag says, "nice"
Binder says, "So that my 'address book' functionality is integrated into my email message storage."
Crag says, "That shouldn't be too hard"
Binder wouldn't think so but hasn't had the time to dig into it, yet.
Crag says, "At the technical level I mean"
Binder says, "It seems like it should be a trivial extension of IMAP client libraries."
Crag says, "The only hard part is finding out how the namespace is treated by various existing clients"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "totally"
Binder says, "And that should be uniformish."
Binder says, "Given that UW has a chokehold on the standard."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "'course, what you're really talking about..."
Crag says, "Is a kind of network filesystem"
Crag says, "based on IMAP :)"
Binder receives email from Conan Cobb.
Binder . o O ( mmm corn on the cob )
Crag says, "Who?"
Binder says, "Spamname."
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "heh"
Binder says, "Actually, what I'm talking about is taking advantage of IMAP already BEING a network filesystem and overloading it to store related-data."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder <- lazy
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "So it would be good to solve all those namespace problems at once"
Crag says, "Get in touch with the UW folks and negotiate some kind of scheme for storing things of type WHATEVER in folders named WHATEVER/HOOKER or something"
Binder says, "Because to me contact data doesn't need to be stored on a given user-station or a given mail-client, it needs to be stored with my server-side email."
Crag says, "And then you can do that with contacts or anything else"
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder doesn't want to get too crazy.
Crag heh
Binder would settle for contacts.
Binder says, "If that works out MAYBE I would think about other PIM-type stuff."
Crag says, "yeah, but what about calendar items?"
Crag says, "I see"
Crag says, "simplest thing that could work I suppose"
Binder says, "Besides, if I do this, and it's a good idea to store calendar stuff there, too, someone else will implement it."
Binder says, "Or even if it's not a good idea.  :)"
Crag says, "There may already be pieces in place for this"
Binder says, "Yeah, probably."
Crag googles a bit
Binder has made some cursory searches previously but only turned up PIM suites and vaporware.
Binder says, "ie, other people have said it would be cool but no one had code to show."
Binder says, "But it was a while back."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I'll take a quick peek right now"
Binder <- curiously fixated on using ie
Crag | IMAP was originally developed in 1986 at Stanford University.
Crag says, "I had no idea."
Crag says, "Ah, here you go"
Crag | There is a companion protocol to IMAP, developed at Carnegie Mellon University. It is called the "Application Configuration Access Protocol", or ACAP, and provides the same location independent access to configuration files, address books, bookmark lists, etc, that IMAP offers for mailboxes.
Crag says, "That's probably why IMAP doesn't include that stuff itself."
Crag says, "I'm not sure I understand why one would want a separate protocol though"
Crag checks out ACAP
Binder says, "Maybe it was meant to be a universal solution which was too resource intensive for the available systems?"
Crag says, "could be"
Crag says, "ok, I'm done looking around"
Crag says, "I'm heading out."

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $STRING_UTILS[1]
=======================================

For a complete description of a given verb, do `help $string_utils:verbname'[2]

    Conversion routines:

:char_list    (string)                               => {"a", "b", "c"}
:to_list      (string)                               => {"a", "foo", "bear"}

                                                  or => {0, error message}
:prefix_to_value(string)                             => {rest-of-string, value}
                                                  or => {0, error message}
:end_expression (string)                             => index of expression

:from_value[_suspended] (value [,quoteflag [,maxlistdepth]])
                                                     => "{foo1, foo2, foo3}"
:print[_suspended] (value)                           => "{foo1, foo2, foo3}"

                                           with prefix
:match_stringlist(string, string-list)  => index/$ambiguous_match/$failed_match
:index_delimited(string,target[, case]) => index of delimited string occurrence
:index_all(string, target[, delimited]) => all occurrences of target in string
:next_index(str1, str2, prev[, case])   => index, after index `prev'

    Object Matching (see also $command_utils):

:literal_object(string)                        => object match independent
                                                  of location
:match        (string, [obj-list, prop-name]+) => matching object

 (see also :to_list, above)
:words   (string)      -- string => list of words (as with command line parser)
:word_start (string)   -- string => list of start-end pairs.
:first_word (string)   -- string => {first word, rest of string} or {}

                                       => list of strings in n columns
:columnize/se_no_truncate(list,n[,linelen])
                                       => same, but will not truncate items
:columnize/se_with_headers(headers, fields) => columnize, plus headers

    Substitutions

:substitute (string, subst_list [,case])  -- general substitutions.

:pronoun_sub (string/list[,who[,thing[,location]]])
                                          -- pronoun substitutions.
:pronoun_sub_secure (string[,who[,thing[,location]]],default)
                                          -- substitute and check for names.
:pronoun_quote (string/list/subst_list)   -- quoting for pronoun substitutions.
:regexp_quote(string)                     -- quoting for regexps.

    Miscellaneous string munging:

:is_lowercase (string)       => true iff no uppercase letters in string
:nonblank     (string)       => true iff any non-whitespace characters

:connection_hostname(string) => hostname part of connection identifier.

    Conversions to and from common string formats:

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $OBJECT_UTILS[1]
=======================================

These routines are useful for finding out information about individual objects.

Examining everything an object has defined on it:
  all_verbs          (object) => like it says
  all_properties     (object) => likewise
  findable_properties(object) => tests to see if caller can "find" them
  owned_properties   (object[, owner]) => tests for ownership

Investigating inheritance:
  ancestors(object[,object...]) => all ancestors
  descendants      (object)     => all descendants
  ordered_descendants(object)   => descendants, in a different order
  leaves           (object)     => descendants with no children
  branches         (object)     => descendants with children 
  isa        (object,class) => true iff object is a descendant of class (or ==)

Considering containment:
  contains      (obj1, obj2) => Does obj1 contain obj2 (nested)?
  all_contents      (object) => return all the (nested) contents of object

Verifying verbs and properties:
  has_property(object,pname) => false/true   according as object.(pname) exists
  has_verb    (object,vname) => false/{#obj} according as object:(vname) exists
  has_callable_verb          => same, but verb must be callable from a program
  match_verb  (object,vname) => false/{location, newvname}
                               (identify location and usable name of verb)
Suspending:
  Many of the above verbs have ..._suspended versions to assist with very large object hierarchies.  The following exist:
   descendants_suspended              
   branches_suspended                 
   leaves_suspended                   
   all_properties_suspended           
   descendants_with_property_suspended

GENERAL INFORMATION ON $SET_UTILS[1]
====================================

This object is useful for operations that treat lists as sets (i.e., without concern about order and assuming no duplication).

 union(set, set, ...)        => union
 intersection(set, set, ...) => intersection

 diff*erence(set 1, set 2, ..., set n)
        => result of removing all elements of sets 2..n from set 1.
 exclusive_or(set, set, set, ...)
        => all elements that are contained in exactly one of the sets

 equals(set, set, ...)
        => true if and only if all the sets are equal
 contains(set 1, set 2, ..., set n)
        => true if and only if all of sets 2..n are subsets of set 1

-----
GENERAL INFORMATION ON $LIST_UTILS[1]
=====================================

append            (list,list,..) => result of concatenating the given lists
flatten           (list of lists)=> list of all non-list elements
reverse           (list)         => reversed list
remove_duplicates (list)         => list with all duplicates removed
compress          (list)         => list with consecutive duplicates removed
setremove_all     (list,elt)     => list with all occurrences of elt removed
find_insert       (sortedlist,e) => index of first element > e in sortedlist
sort              (list[,keys])  => sorted list

make              (n[,e])        => list of n copies of e
range             (m,n)          => {m,m+1,...,n}

arrayset   (list,val,i[,j,k...]) => array modified so that list[i][j][k]==val

-- Mapping functions (take a list and do something to each element):

map_prop ({o...},prop)              => list of o.(prop)            for all o
map_verb ({o...},verb[,args)        => list of o:(verb)(@args)     for all o
map_arg  ([n,]obj,verb,{a...},args) => list of obj:(verb)(a,@args) for all a

-- Association list functions --

An association list (alist) is a list of pairs (2-element lists), though the following functions have been generalized for lists of n-tuples (n-element lists).  In each case i defaults to 1.

make_alist      (lists[,pad]) => alist from list of parallel lists
assoc        (targ,alist[,i]) => 1st tuple in alist whose i-th element is targ
iassoc       (targ,alist[,i]) => index of same.
assoc_prefix (targ,alist[,i]) => ... whose i-th element has targ as a prefix
iassoc_prefix(targ,alist[,i]) => index of same.
slice             (alist[,i]) => list of i-th elements
sort_alist        (alist[,i]) => alist sorted on i-th elements.

LANGUAGE
========

The MOO programming language is described in excruciating detail in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual, available for FTP from parcftp.xerox.com in the file pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual.txt.  The online help consists of a few quick reference guides here in the help system under the following topics:

statements[1]
      the syntax and semantics of the various kinds of MOO statements
expressions[2]
      the same for the various kinds of MOO expressions
functions[3]
      a list of the primitive functions available to MOO programs

-----
EXPRESSIONS
===========

The following kinds of expressions exist in the MOO programming language:

Literals
========

        number
        # number
        # - number
        "character string"
        error-name

Literal expressions return the obvious values: numbers, object numbers, strings, and errors.

List construction
=================

        { expression , expression , ... , expression }

The list-construction expression evaluates the each of the expressions in turn and returns a list whose elements are the results of those expressions.  Any of the expressions may be prefixed with an at-sign ('@'); in this case, that expression must return a list and, rather than that list becoming an element of the final list, its elements are spliced into the final list.

Variables
=========

        name

Variable expressions return the current value of the named variable.  Variable names must start with a letter or underscore ('_') and contain only letters, digits, and underscores.  The following variables are predefined:

            OBJ, STR, LIST, ERR, NUM
            player, caller, this, verb, args
            argstr, dobj, dobjstr, prepstr, iobj, iobjstr

Their initial values are described in detail in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.

Property reading
================

        expression . name
        expression . ( expression )
        $ name

Property-reading expressions return the current value of a named property on the object that is the value of the first subexpression.  In the second form, the second subexpression must return a string, the name of the property to be read.  The third form is an abbreviation for '#0.name'.

Verb calls
==========

        expression : name ( arguments )
        expression : ( expression ) ( arguments )

Verb-call expressions invoke a named verb on the object that is the value of the first subexpression, passing the given arguments.  In the second form, the second subexpression must return a string, the name of the verb to invoke.  The syntax and semantics of arguments is exactly as in the list-construction expression but no initial or final curly-braces ('{' or '}') are used.

Primitive functions
===================

        function ( arguments )

The function-call expression invokes one of the MOO primitive functions, as listed in `help functions'[1], passing the given arguments.

List indexing
=============

        expression [ expression ]

The indexing expression first evaluates the two subexpressions; call their values S and N, respectively.  S must be a string or a list and N must be a number between 1 and the length of S, inclusive.  The Nth element of S is returned.  The elements of a string are themselves one-character strings.

        expression [ expression .. expression ]

The subsequence expression first evaluates the three subexpressions; call their values S, N1, and N2, respecitively.  S must be a string or a list and N1 and N2 must be numbers.  If N1 <= N2, then both must be between 1 and the length of S, inclusive; the subsequence of S beginning at index N1 and continuing through index N2 is returned.  If N1 > N2, the empty sequence of the same type as S is returned, either "" or {}.

Assignment
==========

        name = expression
        expression . name = expression
        expression . ( expression ) = expression
        $ name = expression

Assignment expressions give new values to variables and object properties.  For the second and third forms, the expressions on the left-hand side of the '=' are evaluated first.  Then the right-hand side expression is evaluated and result is stored in the indicated variable or object property.

Arithemetic
===========

        expression + expression
        expression - expression
        expression * expression
        expression / expression
        expression % expression
        - expression

The arithmetic expressions evaluate the subexpressions, all of which must return numbers, and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remaindering, or negation, respectively.  For addition, the subexpressions may both return strings as well; in this case, the result is the concatenation of the two strings.

Comparisons
===========

        expression == expression
        expression != expression
        expression < expression
        expression <= expression
        expression > expression
        expression >= expression

The comparison expressions evaluate the subexpressions and then test whether or not the first result is equal to, unequal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to the second result, respectively.  If the indicated relation holds then they return 1 and otherwise they return 0.  Comparisons of strings are performed case-insensitively, those of lists are performed on an element-by-element basis, objects are compared by their object numbers, and errors by an ordering given in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.

Logical expressions
===================

        expression ? expression | expression
        expression && expression
        expression || expression
        ! expression

The logical expressions each return results based upon the truth value of their first subexpression; call the value of this expression X.  The first of these returns the value of the second subexpression if X is a true value and that of the third expression if X is a false value; the unused subexpression is not evaluated.  The definitions of 'true value' and 'false value' are given in `help truth'[2].  The expression 'E1 && E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E2 | E1' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression 'E1 || E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E1 | E2' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression '! E' is an abbreviation for 'E ? 0 | 1'.

List membership
===============

        expression IN expression

The list-membership expression first evaluates both subexpressions; call their values E and L, respectively.  L must be a list.  If E is an element of L, then the index of the first occurence of E in L is returned.  If E is not an element of L, then 0 is returned.

The method for disambiguating the meaning of a complex MOO expression in the absence of sufficient parentheses is described in `help precedence'[3].

If N1 <= N2, then both must be between 1 and the length of S, inclusive; the subsequence of S beginning at index N1 and continuing through index N2 is returned.  If N1 > N2, the empty sequence of the same type as S is returned, either "" or {}.

Assignment
==========

        name = expression
        expression . name = expression
        expression . ( expression ) = expression
        $ name = expression

Assignment expressions give new values to variables and object properties.  For the second and third forms, the expressions on the left-hand side of the '=' are evaluated first.  Then the right-hand side expression is evaluated and result is stored in the indicated variable or object property.

Arithemetic
===========

        expression + expression
        expression - expression
        expression * expression
        expression / expression
        expression % expression
        - expression

The arithmetic expressions evaluate the subexpressions, all of which must return numbers, and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remaindering, or negation, respectively.  For addition, the subexpressions may both return strings as well; in this case, the result is the concatenation of the two strings.

Comparisons
===========

        expression == expression
        expression != expression
        expression < expression
        expression <= expression
        expression > expression
        expression >= expression

The comparison expressions evaluate the subexpressions and then test whether or not the first result is equal to, unequal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to the second result, respectively.  If the indicated relation holds then they return 1 and otherwise they return 0.  Comparisons of strings are performed case-insensitively, those of lists are performed on an element-by-element basis, objects are compared by their object numbers, and errors by an ordering given in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.

Logical expressions
===================

        expression ? expression | expression
        expression && expression
        expression || expression
        ! expression

The logical expressions each return results based upon the truth value of their first subexpression; call the value of this expression X.  The first of these returns the value of the second subexpression if X is a true value and that of the third expression if X is a false value; the unused subexpression is not evaluated.  The definitions of 'true value' and 'false value' are given in `help truth'[2].  The expression 'E1 && E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E2 | E1' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression 'E1 || E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E1 | E2' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression '! E' is an abbreviation for 'E ? 0 | 1'.

List membership
===============

        expression IN expression

The list-membership expression first evaluates both subexpressions; call their values E and L, respectively.  L must be a list.  If E is an element of L, then the index of the first occurence of E in L is returned.  If E is not an element of L, then 0 is returned.

The method for disambiguating the meaning of a complex MOO expression in the absence of sufficient parentheses is described in `help precedence'[3].

-----
`HELP LIST' AMBIGUOUS
=====================

Sorry, the topic `list' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help @list'[1]         `help @list#'[2]        `help @list-options'[3]
`help listappend()'[4]  `help listdelete()'[5]  `help listen()'[6]
`help listeners()'[7]   `help @listgag'[8]      `help listinsert()'[9]
`help @listoptions'[10]                         `help listset()'[11]

-----
LISTSET()
=========

Syntax:  listset (list <list>, <value>, int <index>)   => list

Returns a copy of <list> with the <index>th element replaced by <value>.  If <index> is not in the range `[1..length(<list>)]', then `E_RANGE' is raised.

    x = {"foo", "bar", "baz"};
    listset(x, "mumble", 2)   =>   {"foo", "mumble", "baz"}

This function exists primarily for historical reasons; it was used heavily before the server supported indexed assignments like `x[i] = v'.  New code should always use indexed assignment instead of `listset()' wherever possible.

#49:FIND_INSERT
===============

find_insert(sortedlist,key[,compare]) => index of first element in sortedlist > key

  sortedlist is assumed to be sorted in increasing order and the number returned is anywhere from 1 to length(sortedlist)+1, inclusive.

  compare, if given, is an object/verb pair to call when comparing each function; it should return a positive number if a > b, negative if a < b, 0 if a == b.  default to >/</=.

-----
INSERT
======

Syntax:  put <object> into <container>
         insert <object> in <container>

Moves the named object into the named container (see `help containers'[1]).  Sometimes the owners of the object and/or the container will not allow you to do this.

-----
LISTINSERT()
============

Syntax:  listinsert (list <list>, <value> [, int <index>])   => list
         listappend (list <list>, <value> [, int <index>])   => list

These functions return a copy of <list> with <value> added as a new element.  `listinsert()' and `listappend()' add <value> before and after (respectively) the existing element with the given <index>, if provided.

The following three expressions always have the same value:

    listinsert(<list>, <element>, <index>)
    listappend(<list>, <element>, <index> - 1)
    {@<list>[1..<index> - 1], <element>, @<list>[<index>..length(<list>)]}

If <index> is not provided, then `listappend()' adds the <value> at the end of the list and `listinsert()' adds it at the beginning; this usage is discouraged, however, since the same intent can be more clearly expressed using the list-construction expression, as shown in the examples below.

    x = {1, 2, 3};
    listappend(x, 4, 2)   =>   {1, 2, 4, 3}
    listinsert(x, 4, 2)   =>   {1, 4, 2, 3}
    listappend(x, 4)      =>   {1, 2, 3, 4}
    listinsert(x, 4)      =>   {4, 1, 2, 3}
    {@x, 4}               =>   {1, 2, 3, 4}
    {4, @x}               =>   {4, 1, 2, 3}

@EDIT
=====

Usage:  @edit <object>:<verb-name> [<args>]
        @edit <object>.<prop-name>
        @edit <object>

Enter the appropriate editor for the specified target.  The first form is handled by the verb editor (and is available only to programmers); the second is handled by either the note editor or the list editor; and the third is handled in an object-dependent way.  (For notes, this translates to editing <object>.text; for most other objects, it translates to editing <object>.description.)

Current edit options:

-quiet-insert       Report line numbers on insert or append.
-eval-subs          Ignore .eval_subs when compiling verbs.
+local              Ship text to client for local editing.
That is not a valid command.

`HELP BUILTINS' NOT FOUND
=========================

Sorry, but no help is available on `builtins'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

`HELP FUNCTION' AMBIGUOUS
=========================

Sorry, the topic `function' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

FUNCTIONS
=========

There are many, many built-in functions available to MOO programmers.  The following list gives a brief summary of the arguments and purpose of each function; for more information, see the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.  

pass(arg, ...)              -- call same verb defined on this object's parent
raise(code[, msg[, value]]) -- raise code as an error

typeof(value)      -- determine the data type of value
 tostr(value, ...) -- concatenate values into a string
 tonum(value)      -- convert non-list value into a integer
 toint(value)      == tonum(value)
 tofloat(value)    -- convert non-list value into a float
 toobj(value)      -- convert non-list value into an object
floatstr(float, precision, scientific?)
                   -- convert float value to string
encode_binary(value, ...)      -- values to binary string
decode_binary(bstring[, full]) -- binary string to list of values

binary_hash(bstring) -- MD5 hash value of binary string
string_hash(string)  -- MD5 hash value of string
value_hash(value)    == string_hash(toliteral(value))

value_bytes(value)   --- number of bytes required to store value
object_bytes(object) --- number of bytes required to store object

eval(string)       -- parse and execute string as MOO code
toliteral(value)   -- convert value to a string that evaluates to it
call_function(func[, arg, ...]) == func([arg, ...])

function_info([func]) -- builtin function desc (or list of all of them)

length(list/string) -- returns the length of a string or list
listappend(list, value [, index]) -- adding an element at the end of a list
listinsert(list, value [, index]) -- adding an element at the head of a list
   listset(list, value, index)    -- updating a list at some index
listdelete(list, index)           -- removing an element from a list
    setadd(list, element) -- adding an element to a set represented as a list
 setremove(list, element) -- removing an element from such a set
is_member(element, list) -- case-sensitive version of (element IN list)
equal(v1,v2)             -- case-sensitive version of (v1 == v2)

min(n1, n2, ...) -- minimum of n1,n2,...
max(n1, n2, ...) -- maximum of n1,n2,...
random(n)        -- random integer between 1 and n inclusive
 time()          -- current time in seconds since midnight GMT, 1 Jan 70
ctime([time])    -- time (or current time) converted to a human-readable string

  abs(n) -- absolute value of n
floor(x) -- truncate x towards minus infinity
trunc(x) -- truncate x towards zero
 ceil(x) -- truncate x towards plus infinity
 sqrt(n) -- square root of n
  exp(x) -- e to the x
  log(x) -- natural log
log10(x) -- base 10 log
 sin(a),  cos(a),  tan(a)     -- circular trignometric functions
asin(y), acos(x), atan(x[,y]) -- inverse circular trignometric functions
 sinh(a), cosh(a), tanh(a)    -- hyperbolic trigonometric functions

 index(str1, str2 [, case-matters]) -- index of first str2 in str1
rindex(str1, str2 [, case-matters]) -- index of last  str2 in str1
strcmp(str1, str2) -- case-sensitive string comparison
strsub(subject, what, with [, case-matters]) -- substitution in a string
crypt(string [, salt]) -- one-way string encryption
 match(str1, str2 [, case-matters]) -- match first pattern str2 in str1
rmatch(str1, str2 [, case-matters]) -- match last  pattern str2 in str1
substitute(template, subs) -- perform substitutions on template

   valid(object)             -- testing whether an object exists

DISASSEMBLE()
=============

Syntax:  disassemble (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>)   => list

Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal ``compiled'' form of the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  This format is not documented and may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of `disassemble()' interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then `disassemble()' raises `E_PERM'.

FUNCTIONS
=========

There are many, many built-in functions available to MOO programmers.  The following list gives a brief summary of the arguments and purpose of each function; for more information, see the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.  

pass(arg, ...)              -- call same verb defined on this object's parent
raise(code[, msg[, value]]) -- raise code as an error

typeof(value)      -- determine the data type of value
 tostr(value, ...) -- concatenate values into a string
 tonum(value)      -- convert non-list value into a integer
 toint(value)      == tonum(value)
 tofloat(value)    -- convert non-list value into a float
 toobj(value)      -- convert non-list value into an object
floatstr(float, precision, scientific?)
                   -- convert float value to string
encode_binary(value, ...)      -- values to binary string
decode_binary(bstring[, full]) -- binary string to list of values

binary_hash(bstring) -- MD5 hash value of binary string
string_hash(string)  -- MD5 hash value of string
value_hash(value)    == string_hash(toliteral(value))

value_bytes(value)   --- number of bytes required to store value
object_bytes(object) --- number of bytes required to store object

eval(string)       -- parse and execute string as MOO code
toliteral(value)   -- convert value to a string that evaluates to it
call_function(func[, arg, ...]) == func([arg, ...])

function_info([func]) -- builtin function desc (or list of all of them)

length(list/string) -- returns the length of a string or list
listappend(list, value [, index]) -- adding an element at the end of a list
listinsert(list, value [, index]) -- adding an element at the head of a list
   listset(list, value, index)    -- updating a list at some index
listdelete(list, index)           -- removing an element from a list
    setadd(list, element) -- adding an element to a set represented as a list
 setremove(list, element) -- removing an element from such a set

`HELP TASK' AMBIGUOUS
=====================

Sorry, the topic `task' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help task_id()'[1]     `help task_stack()'[2]  `help tasks'[3]

-----
`HELP PERMS' NOT FOUND
======================

Sorry, but no help is available on `perms'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

-----
SET_TASK_PERMS()
================

Syntax:  set_task_perms (obj <who>) => none

Changes the permissions with which the currently-executing verb is running to be those of <who>.  If the programmer is neither <who> nor a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.

*NOTE*:  This does not change the owner of the currently-running verb, only the permissions of this particular invocation.  It is used in verbs owned by wizards to make themselves run with lesser (usually non-wizard) permissions.

-----
CALLER_PERMS()
==============

Syntax:  caller_perms ()   => obj

Returns the permissions in use by the verb that called the currently-executing verb.  If the currently-executing verb was not called by another verb (i.e., it is the first verb called in a command or server task), then `caller_perms()' returns `#-1'.

-----
`HELP WIZARD' AMBIGUOUS
=======================

Sorry, the topic `wizard' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help wizard-list'[1]   `help wizards'[2]       

-----
WIZARDS
=======

The wizards deny everything.

-----
WIZARD-LIST
===========

The wizards deny everything.

GhostOfTheManor shouts, "OoOOOOOooOoooOOO!!!!!"
GhostOfTheManor shouts, "me is "%Nd %n:(broadcasts) a psychic message: %$a""
Crag says, "well that's retarded"
-----
`HELP NOTIFY' AMBIGUOUS
=======================

Sorry, the topic `notify' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help #1:notify'[1]     `help notify()'[2]      

-----
NOTIFY()
========

Syntax:  notify (obj <conn>, str <string> [, <no-flush>])   => none

Enqueues <string> for output (on a line by itself) on the connection <conn>.  If the programmer is not <conn> or a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.  If <conn> is not a currently-active connection, then this function does nothing.  Output is normally written to connections only between tasks, not during execution.

The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the `MAX_QUEUED_OUTPUT' compilation option (in `options.h') controls the limit.  When an attempt is made to enqueue output that would take the server over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the connection without having to wait for the other end.  If that doesn't result in the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away the oldest lines in the queue until the new ouput will fit.  The server remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line like `>> Network buffer overflow: <X> lines of output to you have been lost <<' where <X> is the number of flushed lines.

If <no-flush> is provided and true, then `notify()' never flushes any output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false.  `Notify()' otherwise always returns true.

-----
BINARY_HASH()
=============

Syntax:  string_hash (str <text>)       => str
         binary_hash (str <bin-string>) => str

Returns a 32-character hexadecimal string encoding the result of applying the MD5 cryptographically secure hash function to the contents of the string <text> or the binary string <bin-string>.  MD5, like other such functions, has the property that, if
    string_hash(<x>) == string_hash(<y>)
then, almost certainly,
    equal(<x>, <y>)
This can be useful, for example, in certain networking applications: after sending a large piece of text across a connection, also send the result of applying `string_hash()' to the text; if the destination site also applies `string_hash()' to the text and gets the same result, you can be quite confident that the large text has arrived unchanged.

-----
NOTIFY()
========

Syntax:  notify (obj <conn>, str <string> [, <no-flush>])   => none

Enqueues <string> for output (on a line by itself) on the connection <conn>.  If the programmer is not <conn> or a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.  If <conn> is not a currently-active connection, then this function does nothing.  Output is normally written to connections only between tasks, not during execution.

The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the `MAX_QUEUED_OUTPUT' compilation option (in `options.h') controls the limit.  When an attempt is made to enqueue output that would take the server over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the connection without having to wait for the other end.  If that doesn't result in the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away the oldest lines in the queue until the new ouput will fit.  The server remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line like `>> Network buffer overflow: <X> lines of output to you have been lost <<' where <X> is the number of flushed lines.

If <no-flush> is provided and true, then `notify()' never flushes any output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false.  `Notify()' otherwise always returns true.

-----
DISASSEMBLE()
=============

Syntax:  disassemble (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>)   => list

Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal ``compiled'' form of the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  This format is not documented and may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of `disassemble()' interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then `disassemble()' raises `E_PERM'.

DISASSEMBLE()
=============

Syntax:  disassemble (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>)   => list

Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal ``compiled'' form of the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  This format is not documented and may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of `disassemble()' interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then `disassemble()' raises `E_PERM'.

-----
`HELP VERB' AMBIGUOUS
=====================

Sorry, the topic `verb' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help @verb'[1]         `help verb_args()'[2]   `help verb_code()'[3]
`help verb_info()'[4]   `help verbs()'[5]       

-----
VERB_CODE()
===========

Syntax:  verb_code (obj <object>, str <verb-desc> [, <fully-paren> [, <indent>]])   => list
     set_verb_code (obj <object>, str <verb-desc>, list <code>)   => list

These functions get and set (respectively) the MOO-code program associated with the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>.  The program is represented as a list of strings, one for each line of the program; this is the kind of value returned by `verb_code()' and expected as the third argument to `set_verb_code()'.  For `verb_code()', the expressions in the returned code are usually written with the minimum-necessary parenthesization; if <full-paren> is true, then all expressions are fully parenthesized.  Also for `verb_code()', the lines in the returned code are usually not indented at all; if <indent> is true, each line is indented to better show the nesting of statements.

If <object> is not valid, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then `E_VERBNF' is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then `verb_code()' (`set_verb_code()') raises `E_PERM'.  If the programmer is not, in fact. a programmer, then `E_PERM' is raised.

For `set_verb_code()', the result is a list of strings, the error messages generated by the MOO-code compiler during processing of <code>.  If the list is non-empty, then `set_verb_code()' did not install <code>; the program associated with the verb in question is unchanged.

-----

Binder | I have qmail installed in my system. How can I
Binder | configure qmail to utilizing the system? I looked at
Binder | the RT Essential because it described about using
Binder | qmail. However, It is really messy because the book
Binder | mentioned #cat ~rt/.qmail-general.
Binder |
Binder | I don't know where doesn this ~rt mean? Did you have
Binder | similar experience?
Binder says, "I'd think he were a troll if it weren't so plausible to me that someone at UIowa could be that stupid and vocal."
Devil [to Binder]: what is RT?
Binder [to Devil]: Request Tracker.
Binder [to Devil]: You remember Obra/Jesse?
Binder [to Devil]: He wrote it.
Devil . o O [ do i? ]

Binder [to Devil]: It's a ticketing system with multiple shiny features.
Binder [to Devil]: Por ejemplo:  multiple queues, multiple user-group privilege levels, scriptable triggers, sql db backend [Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, Sybase, etc], web UI, email UI.
Binder [to Devil]: There's paid support for it, if you want it, there is a related asset tracking package and it integrates with Best Practical's other software package, RTFM.
Binder [to Devil]: So you can tie requests-from-users to managed-assets and collected lessons learned into a documentation repository.
Devil says, "ah ha"
Binder says, "We use RT here at PF for my neck of things.  Dev & QA use fogbugz."

Binder is neutral-apathetic about him.
Binder is getting nothing done today.
Binder says, "Except for consuming caffeine in liquid forms."

Crag says, "I'm still recovering from sickness"
Binder says, "Hey, that's my story, too."
Binder is recovering from Crag's illness.
Crag says, "my illness is just that bad"
Crag says, "You should go home sick with my cold"
Crag says, "You boss would totally buy that"
Binder says, "I caught it from the internets!"
Crag says, "computer virus"
Crag says, "The elf told me orcs are a virus"
Crag says, "that might not be true"
Crag says, "it also might not be very funny"

Binder says, "No, it's funny."
Binder LAUGHS.

Crag says, "After the distortion I'm not sure I can trust my eyes."
Binder  :)
Crag says, "Now that winter is almost over up here I'm getting homesick for California again"
Binder says, "Is it because now you have the energy to be nostalgic?"
Crag says, "I don't think so"
Crag says, "but I can't argue against that possibility either"
Crag says, "now I know there's something wrong with me - someone made microwave popcorn and it kinda smells good to me."
Binder says, "You're suffering a radiation deficit."
Crag nods solemnly.
Binder provides his afternoon status update:  still not getting shit done.
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag says, "everything's a cycle.  It's like a merry-go-round.  It goes up and down, and round and round."
Binder says, "That's deep."
Binder says, "Almost deep enough to call for some celebratory candy."
Binder fights off the impulse.
Crag says, "I am full of hate"
Crag says, "There are a lot of ... non-genius people working at WDIG"

You are in a building that is the size of a large gazebo or perhaps a small silo. The exterior is covered in ornately-painted canvas, featuring large yellow, orange, and blue Raffaelesco dragons. Inside, the ceiling is covered in a tessellating pattern made up of turtles.  A lumpy pillow is here.  A fluffy pillow is here.  A blue bean bag is here.  A red bean bag is here.  An Ol'cafe chair is here.  You are sitting on it.  A Taco Stand is here.  A squishy pillow is here.  A rocking chair is here.  Binder is sitting on it.  An oriental rug is here.  The screen door to the Forest Clearing is closed.

Devil [to stormagnet]: here it is again: http://www.horae.dti.ne.jp/~fuwe1a/newpage5.html
Crag [to Devil]: that is very strange
Binder refuses to look.
Devil [to Crag]: yes.  More proof: Japanese People Are Weird
Crag says, "it's true."
Crag idles: not at work
[Idling at 4:31 P.M. on Tue, Mar 7: not at work]
Crag vroom
Crag <- not idle
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm using that itty-bitty optical mouse, and it's working pretty well for being so tiny.
Crag says, "So far it's better than a touchpad or eraserhead"
Crag says, "Not as good as your tablet, of course.  heh"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'm going to be home late-ish tonight and I will probably work Thursday and Friday
Crag says, "I've got to finish my "Everseer/Unix" project this week"
Crag says, "Or else I won't be able to enjoy my birthday next week"
Crag says, "Plus it means HELLA OVERTIME"
Crag says, "I will probably end up with 25 hours of overtime this week"
Binder blinks.
Binder says, "That's HELLA overtime."
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Who is this metatron person?"
Binder was waiting for that question.
Binder says, "Actually, the minute I saw his glibness about anarchy -> totalitarianism."
Binder says, "He's a computer person of some ilk in the Twin Cities."
Binder says, "He's someone Laws thought would make a good add to Junk."
Binder says, "He's the brother of someone I despise, so I'm more ambiguous on him."
Binder wields a fat, tarry brush.
Binder says, "In my experience with him on other BBSes, he delights in stirring up shit and taking antagonistic positions."
Binder says, "So I would recommend remembering that whatever he says, it's got little in common with what he might actually believe or do."
Crag bleah
Crag says, "a troll"
Binder says, "More or less.  I think he probably has some real beliefs, somewhere, but it's never been worth anyone's time to try to argue with him."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "I formed a hypothesis this morning about politics."
Binder says, "I think, like sex, that much of what is 'decided' in personal political stances is subrational."
Binder says, "By which I mean, we make decisions for instinctive reasons."
Crag says, "That seams likely"
Binder says, "And then expend thought to justify them after the fact."
Crag says, "that too"
Binder says, "And maybe it's social 'all our friends feel this way' or biological 'i feel fear when i think about that' or psychological 'i don't want to be like that'."
Binder says, "But for whatever complex of reasons, we feel some things are right, some are wrong, and we will filter what we perceive to justify and reinforce those stances."
Binder says, "Admittedly, not a breakthrough hypothesis."
Binder says, "But it does have one strong correlation."
Crag says, "I imagine the root motivation varies amongst people"
Binder says, "Which is:  you can never argue someone into changing their political view."
Crag says, "I think for the most part that's true"
Binder says, "Because it's not rational."
Binder says, "You could maybe target the root motivation, if you could see it."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "I don't think it's possible to have a purely rational political preference"
Binder says, "Metatron did raise one excellent point, but it's not new.  Anarchy is vulnerable to a cult of personality/power."
Binder says, "But that's not exclusive to anarchy."
Crag says, "exactly"
Binder says, "It's happening now in our republican form of democracy."
Binder says, "With pro-Bush being equated as conservative/good/right-wing and anti-Bush being equated as liberal/bad/left-wing."
Crag nods
Binder says, "I think it's possible to have a purely rational political preference, but hard to actually act on it."
Binder says, "Say you were able to put together some mathematical formula."
Binder says, "Put in all your variables for what is right and good and important."
Crag says, "THere's no motivation without some non-rational preference"
Binder says, "Calculate the right answer."
Binder says, "You might STILL not be able to act on it."
Binder says, "Because you don't like the answer."
Crag says, "For example, there's no purely rational reason why humans must promote their own wellbeing"
Binder can agree to that.
Binder says, "The wellbeing of their offspring is perhaps rational[izable]."
Crag says, "Is it?"
Crag says, "I mean, I understand why we want it"
Crag says, "But I don't think biological motivaction can be counted as rational"
Binder says, "Is it irrational to want to succeed?"
Crag says, "I don't think reason cares about success"
Crag says, "I think that pure reason leads to nihilism"
Binder says, "Then what does it care about?  Or is care inapplicable to reason?"
Binder ponders.
Crag says, "I admit I stole this idea from stormagnet :)"
Binder thinks.
Binder says, "I don't think that pure reason leads to nihilism because I think that is an error in the opposite direction, of attributing negative motive to reason."
Crag says, "hm"
Binder says, "It may not be applicable to attribute motive to reason since reason is nominally a tool."
Crag says, "Maybe I mis-used the word 'nihilism'"
Crag says, "I agree with that"
Binder says, "Logic, analysis, synthesis."
Binder says, "So a potentially plausible reasonable argument for the wellbeing of humans is that humans are reasoners and if perpetuated more reason would happen."
Binder . o O ( at least in THEORY )
Crag says, "hm..."
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "I think this is really just a game of a three-year-old asking "why?" over and over until the grownup gets upset"
Crag says, "Because I can ask what's so great about more reason"
Binder says, "Yeah.  That's the great thing about using reason against itself."
Binder says, "Reductio ad absurdem."
Crag says, "heh"
Binder randomly transposes consonents.
Crag says, "That said, there are a lot of fundamental motivations that most people agree on"
Binder says, "So I can see where thinking about thinking would lead toward a perspective approximating nihilism."
Binder says, "But I don't think that's the true end point for every line of thinking about thinking."
Binder says, "Though Nietzsche makes a compelling case for giving up at that point."
Binder says, "As does, probably, Sartre."
Binder says, "What did thinking ever get us?  Kill yourself!"
Binder says, "Yeah, that fundamental motive thing is on my mind this morning, too."
Binder says, "People who oppose anarchy have tended to express the point of view that the only reason people aren't killing each other is because it's illegal and the only reason that people work is that they're paid, in my experience."
Binder says, "And maybe it's true, for them.  That if it weren't a crime, they would try to kill me, and if they weren't paid, they wouldn't do anything."
Binder says, "But I don't think it's true for me."
Binder says, "I genuinely like to solve puzzles and fix problems and if I weren't directly compensated, I'd still do that.  I might not commute as far to do it and I would definitely work on problems more of my choosing, but that's what money is for me, an incentive to travel further and work on problems someone else thinks are interesting."
Binder says, "And I don't think I'd kill anyone.  Maybe not even in self-defense."
Binder says, "But I probably would in self-defense, I just don't like to feel that I would."
Crag [to Binder]: I agree
Crag says, "ANd I think that the arguments about laws making people behave are demonstrably faulty"
Crag says, "Specifically, people DO commit crimes, no matter how strong the deterent, and there is plenty of documentation showing that punishment does little to reduce crime"
Crag says, "And many people DO work for free, and many other people get paid and do nothing"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "Furthermore, I claim that these ideas that people are only motivated by fear and greed are in fact making the problem worse"
Binder says, "But those cases which show the flaws are invisible to people of the mindset which holds that it must be true."
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "And I think what you were saying before about non-rational reasons for thinking things is the main problem there"
Binder says, "One of the most interesting parallels concerning belief-about-viability-of-anarchy is that it roughly parallels belief-about-viability-of-agnosticism."
Crag says, "yes!"
Binder says, "That is, many people seem to want to be either theist or atheist and demand that everyone else take a stand."
Crag says, "There has to be a god or why should we be good"
Crag says, "that too"
Binder says, "Just as many people seem to want to be either right-wing or left-wing and demand that everyone else take a stand."
Crag says, "excellent point"
Binder says, "And, yes, the God-law pole is another parallel."
Binder gives Crag an xp for 'astute point'.
Crag heh
Crag gives Binder an xp for 'incisive'.
Crag says, "The Lucifer Principle has a lot of interesting things to say about all this too"
Crag says, "Mostly about how people will believe, say and do whatever they have to in order to promote whatever group they feel attached to"
Crag says, "ANd that they'll justify and alter their memories to support that"
Crag says, "ANd there are research citations and whatnot"
Crag says, "My motivation for political discussion is refining my world model and communications about it"
Crag says, "But in thinking about it I realize it takes a lot to get me to challenge my own assumptions"
Crag says, "A lot more than I would like to admit"
Binder says, "And that's not uncommon."
Binder declines to rise to further Metatron bait.
Crag heh
Binder says, "He got me with rolling up consensus in with rules and regulations as an enforced state regime."
Binder says, "But now I see that he's taking the position that unless people are killing each other, it's not -real- anarchy."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'm just going to post a wikipedia and anarchist faq link and be done with it."
Crag says, "And I'm going to agree with Evermore"
Binder says, "That's good, since I believe they're fucking."
Binder says, "Evermore and Metatron, that is."
Crag says, "heh, that's funny"
Crag says, "damn, the post I'm composing is getting pretty long"
Crag says, "screw it, I'm cutting the extra.  The anti folks wouldn't understand it and the pro-folks don't need it."
Crag muses: It is not the thousand programs you have re-written once which interest me.  I prefer to use the one program you have re-written a thousand times.
Crag says, "Laws' post has unbalanced parentheses"
Binder says, "She's quite upset."
Crag says, "Ah"
Binder says, "She still thinks that politicians should be capable of integrity and acting in the best interest of their constitutents."
Binder says, "So when they demonstrate that they aren't, she becomes upset."
Crag says, "That's understandable"
Crag says, "It would be wonderful if it were possible to objectively sort humans by integrity"
Crag says, "And it's incredibly frustrating watching the mess we've got now."
Crag says, "ok, I posted a followup."
Crag says, "I'm not sure what I hope to accomplish anymore, but I felt a strong need to respond."
Binder says, "Nice."
Binder idles: LUNCH NOW.
Crag says, "thanks :)"
Binder LAUGHS.
Binder says, "It appears that your post accomplished something.  If encouraging further trolling is an accomplishment."
Crag . o O [ ut oh ]

Binder is declining to respond.
Crag says, "I'm taking the bait"

Crag laughs
Crag says, "that's nice"
Crag says, "thatsfine.org is available..."
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "nah, I should be saving my money"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "My stance on this is going to be one of disengagement.  I think he's probably trolling, since he has access to the same information we do, and has already made up his mind that anarchy == crime spree."
Binder says, "But if you need to respond, you need to respond."
Binder says, "Get down with your bad self."
Binder [to stormagnet]: If you like singing otters you will want to Gamefly Tales of Legendia for ps/2.
