When I'm having difficulty directing myself

- "Step back" and observe the feeling, expectations, assumptions and reality
- "Is this rebelion?"
- "What needs are insufficiently met?"

Then start problem solving

...

Formalizing recognition of my progress can bolster me in more difficult times.
  For example: "I didn't beat myself up for not exercising"
