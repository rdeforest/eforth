# Notes for Psych appointment

TL;DR: I thought the increased escetalipram wasn't doing anything until I
realized I had been more productive and enjoyed myself more.

## Since last visit

- Good
 - Completed all the work I had promised my manager
 - Vacuumed apartment
 - Tidied up everything except the computer cables
  - They're a whole project of their own
 - Mounted last two guitar hooks
 - Re-strung two guitars
 - Played guitar and bass for more than half an hour
 - Good times with Meri, Jasmine, Kelly and Mianna

- Bad
 - Still haven't ramped down drinking at the rate I had hoped to
  - Had a useful conversation with Jasmine about it though
 - Lost my badge, then lost my temp badge
 
- Other
 - Haven't noticed any change from the med adjustment
  - (other than improvements in behavior noted above)
 - Decided to sell my motorcycle
  - Can't enjoy it in Seattle
  - Need the money

## Ongoing

- Haven't done any of the divorce stuff like changing my address
- Haven't talked to Raine about money

## Questions

- Should I take daytime oncall?
- Should I take a vacation first?

## On Raine

- All I can do is ask
 - reasons for asking?
  - to hurt her
  - want to negotiate
  - straining the relationship

Can't pretend the marriage didn't happen or that it isn't over.
Not good to leave it up to Raine to decide what happens next.

## Other advice

- Take "Activated B Complex"
