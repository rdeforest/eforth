# What I want in my relationship with Raine

It may be that I cannot have all of these. They are listed in order.

- Complete closure for me
 - A concrete time line with milestones
 - Said time line to be complete by 2020
- Her to be truly independent
 - Her to safe
- Her to like me

# What I am willing to provide

## Current arrangement

$5k/month, minus ... something

If $5k/mo were invested in something which paid 0.5% monthly (< 6.2%
annually), after 29 months it would be worth ~$155k:

```coffee
1.005 ** 12
# => 1.0616778118644976

[0..28].map((n) -> 1.005 ** n * 5000).reduce (a, b) -> a + b
# => 155621.97303019447
```

This doesn't seem like a wise use of resources.

## Other options

If we shared a place again we could save at least $1080 a month. Possibly
another $1000 if I ate 18 meals a week at home with her and didn't drink out.

If we combine this with the $500 she has in her budget for savings and
"invest" in paying down debt which is at a rate of 0.5% monthly (I assume it's
worse than that), that investment is worth

```coffee
[0..28]
  .map (n) -> 2500 * 1.005 ** n
  .reduce (a, b) -> a + b
# => 77810.98651509723
```

# Her independence

She says she doesn't think she'll ever be able to support herself entirely. I
disagree. This is a problem.

# My closure

As long as I'm sending her money every month, I'll never feel free of the
responsibilities I took on when I commited my life to her. I cannot have
closure until she releases me from all of my commitments.
