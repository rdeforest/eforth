# Today's agenda for therapy

Mission: "To put on my own oxygen mask first."

```

    I strive first to maximize my short and long-term health and happiness,
    then to do the same for those in increasing spheres of concern.

## Returning to engineering solutions to my disfunctions

- Definitions of "done"
- Assessment (mostly done, I just want my own documentation)
- Milestones and other measurements of progress
  - Already have the survey graphs
  - Also have my exercise progress
  - How to measure DPD patterns?
  - How to reliably measure food and beverage intake?
- Strategies
  - establish and maintain routines
  - exercise
  - nutrition
  - limit alcohol consumption to safe levels
  - give up on intimate relationships for now
  - meditation
  - CBT (homework)
    - thought record

## About NPD and DPD

(If there's time.)

12 days ago I thought I made a new friend. Yesterday I armchair-diagnosed them
with NPD caused by head trauma. I also learned about DPD and how much of what
I do fits that description.
