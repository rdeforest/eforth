# The plea

- This is the hardest thing I've done since April
- You have invested enormous trust, time, energy and kindness in me.
- I do not take these for granted.
- I wouldn't risk our friendship without a very good reason
  - I sincerely want to be chosen family forever
- I don't want you to experience any discomfort at my hands, though I am human so it is innevitable
- While I say the rest of this I want you to feel safe and respected, so I have to do this:

(Place the key in her palm, close her fingers around it.)

- What I want to say may put our friendship at risk
  - Our friendship is already at risk while I keep it inside
  - Honesty and forthrightness are extremely important to me
  - I have to tell you what I've been hiding even if I think you already know.
    - I am very much in love with you
    - I don't ask or expect you to return my feelings

- I want to trust you more, but
  - some of your actions seem to violate your principles as I know them (and certainly my own principles)
    - breach of contract, operating in good faith (violating lease terms)
    - speaking ill of others who are either harmless or need to be dealt with appropriately (the neighbor you don't like)
    - the look you gave me last night when I said something dumb seemed aggressive
  - I believe you are entirely free of malice
    - I don't think you want to do these things
  - I think you are hurting yourself to dangerous degrees

Therefore:

I want you to give me this key again after you have been to a psychiatrist and
receied either a diagnosis and plan for healing or a clean bill of health. If
it's the latter I'll need to see documentation. Trust, but verify.

I promise with all my respect, admiration and especially love for you that I
will not reveal any of what you have told me to anyone. I will not tell anyone
where you live. I won't climb in your windows or those of any of your
neighbors. I have not made any copies of this key you trusted me with. I
promise not to say anything about what I think to anyone, especially your
neighbors. 

Most importantly, I promise to respond to you when you reach out to tell me
what your doctor's opinion is. Until then I can't look at you because I will
cry.
