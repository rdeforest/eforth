# After months of couples counseling I'm still put off by Raine's intensity.

## Specific situation

Raine and I were talking about a design she was coming up with for a house
built in the shape of a spiral. She expressed concern that the design's
accessibility would put off potential buyers. I said it was too soon to make
that evaluation. She got mad at me for telling her she was doing her process
wrong.

## My feelings

### Frustration

- She took my _supportive_ comment as otherwise
 - [verification needed]

- My attempts at more than mundane help are almost universally useless or worse
 - [verification needed]

- The value I do provide seems to be irrelevant in other contexts

Why do I feel strongly about this?

  The conflict between our optimism and pessimism seems intractable.
   - We can have no happy future together.

Why does the conflict seem intractable?

  Neither of us sees a benefit in changing our views.
   - [verification needed]

Why do I see no benefit in being more optimistic in the short term and
pessimistic in the long term?

  In the short term we have very little control. In the long term our control
  is an aggregation of the influence we exert over a span of time.

  Using a railroad analogy: the engineer has complete access to the controls
  of the locomotive, but has very limited ability to respond to suddenly
  revealed information. On the other hand, between the train's current
  position and its destination the engineer has ample opportunity to obtain
  information from dispatch in advance and to adjust the locomotive's controls
  to the benefit of all involved. The randomness of the short term averages
  out and in the long term the creativity of the engineer and her colleagues
  has enormous potential value.

  Both short and long term planning benefit from pragmatism and healthy
  risk-management practices. Optimism and pessimissm are not strictly
  necessary for either. I don't like disappointment so I assume the worst in
  the short term and hope to be surprised. Expecting the worst of the future
  is a waste of energy because it is what we do between now and then which
  shapes it most.

  "It'll lower the resale value" is not a useful concern less than an hour
  into the design of a building. The building hasn't even been designed yet,
  much less built or used. There will be plenty of time to address such
  far-out problems.

# Notes

- Another case of the quiet/loud problem
  - Raine's loudness (literally and figuratively) is opposite my expectations
  - When something is really good or really bad she's almost completely still and silent.
  - When something is slightly good or bad she is highly expressive

- Yeah, I don't want to be around Raine any more
