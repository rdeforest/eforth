# A lesson perhaps?

The only down-time for Customer Obsession is when one pays to receive it, and
even then it's within the constraints of Right Human Relations. The rest of
the time we

- seek first to understand, then to be understood 
- do not assume we know what others
 - are thinking or feeling
 - will ask after hearing our answers to their initial questions
 - give others ample comfortable opportunity to interject

One-way communication is boring.

Also

- groups do not have a single mind
 - one member may submit a prompt and another may not welcome the response
- what seems like interest may instead be another's version of being polite
