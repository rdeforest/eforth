I'm in Newberg waiting to hear back from Martha or Liz. I slept at the
Courtyard Mariott, and it was almost the best sleep ever, except for some
interruptions.

# Dream bits

I had some vivid dreaming after one of the interruptions, but all I remember
now, two hours later, is that there were a couple of women interested in me.
One was unfamiliar but very forward and I liked and wanted to encourage that.
The other was Catherine except she had clearly changed in a good way and
wanted to reconnect. I spent the last bits of my dream trying to juggle the
two of them.
