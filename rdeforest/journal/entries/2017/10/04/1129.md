# Notes for Psych appointment

## Since last visit

- Took on daytime on call
- Decided to stay on my current team at least another six months
- Pissed off Raine
- Suspended my training program
- Been taking Activated B Complex

## Feeling

Worst I remember feeling since late 1995 after being let go from my tech
support job.

### Thoughts

- This divorce isn't going to be amicable 
 - Going to have to get a lawyer or something
 - At least nead someone to drive it forward
- Should I stay in Seattle?
 - I could go up to Vancouver to help setup the second half of my team
