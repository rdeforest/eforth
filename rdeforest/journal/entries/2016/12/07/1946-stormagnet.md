# The next day

Naturally her arguments are infallable. As far as I can tell, even what she
says about my disposition is true. I don't love her and maybe I don't know how
to love.

I thought I lost everything last year, and in a way I did. I somehow created a
new relationship with Lookout which has worked out for me, but my
relationships with Raine and Al are on the rocks.

And I'm resigned to it.
