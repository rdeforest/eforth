21:43] stormagnet YES LET'S 
[21:43] guitar.robot I'll set up an appointment 
[21:43] I'm sorry I added to your stress today 
[21:58] guitar.robot I sent Dr. P a copy of our chat for reference. I'll send you an invite for whatever appointment I can get tomorrow.  
[21:58] If you're actually in danger please call 911 
[21:58] and I don't mean that in a condescending way 
[22:00] I'm sorry I was insensitive to your needs 
[22:00] vis a vis the blinds 
[22:01] stormagnet I don't mean this in a condescending way: I don't think you fully appreciate what the danger is, or how limited my means of dealing with it are 
[22:01] I do not expect you to magically understand about the blinds 
[22:02] but when I set things up a certain way, it is generally for a reason 
[22:02] and I don't think you apreciate that 
[22:02] guitar.robot nods 
[22:03] stormagnet I have called the police before 
[22:03] I'm not calling them now because I remember how that went 
[22:04] guitar.robot you could also reach out to me for help in a situation 
[22:04] or T or something 
[22:05] stormagnet I did that before 
[22:05] I have reached out to T 
[22:06] but dude... The last time I seemed you for help with a stalker, you a) got mad at me, and b) went back to sleep 
[22:06] guitar.robot nods 
[22:06] guitar.robot I'm sorry 
[22:07] stormagnet I just need this place to be safe

<blockquote><pre>[13:23] guitar.robot @stormagnet  I just buzzed somebody (laundry?) up
[13:23] I'm assuming you haven't left yet
[13:24] stormagnet probably laundry
[13:24] guitar.robot cool
[13:24] stormagnet I've told them a million times to use 3072 &gt;_&lt; 
[13:24] guitar.robot heh 
[13:24] some people just can't learn?  
[13:24] I dunno 
[13:24] stormagnet ï¿½~T~P(ï¿£ï¿½~Cï¿½ï¿£)ï¿½~T~L 
[13:24] guitar.robot that's another good emoji...  
[13:25] It's like you're checking to see if it's raining...  
[13:25] stormagnet heh 
[14:05] stormagnet I gave the Livible guy your number, for coordination 
[14:05] stormagnet heads out 
[14:06] guitar.robot have good PT :) 
[14:06] stormagnet thanks :) 
[15:31] stormagnet Somebody, presumably Livible, just tried to buzz up- I missed the call 
[15:33] guitar.robot Yeah. They said you told them I'd be early, heh. Anyway, I'm on it 
[15:34] They are already done with the drop off 
[15:39] They cashed me at 15:12 to say they were 10 minutes away. I told ten I would cancel my lunch and meet them at the front door in ten minutes. At 15:23 I was a block away, carrying a quesadilla in a box because it was too late to cancel, and they texted me that they were there. They were at the front door if your apartment on the fourth floor, where I had meant the front door if the building. Surprise! Anyway, all done now 
[15:40] The delivery I mean.  
[17:49] stormagnet ugh, sorry about that 
[17:51] guitar.robot Aw, it's fine, I was enjoying making it out to be more than it was. Don't worry about it. Also ask and I just left so you're all set 
[17:53] I am going to send Dr P a note about stuff so if she reaches your to you that might be why but if not she decided it wasn't helpful or something 
[17:53] Ugh. Ignore that please 
[17:55] Also I parked out front because I embibed 
[18:25] guitar.robot ugh, typos. "Al and I just left", "she reaches out to you". But yeah, strike all of the above other than I'm not at your apartment and all is well 
[21:38] stormagnet no Ok srsly 
[21:38] why do you always raise the binds 
[21:38] guitar.robot ?  
[21:38] stormagnet plz stop doing that 
[21:38] reasons
[21:39] guitar.robot It was dark?  
[21:39] and cramped?  
[21:39] I also opened the windows but closed them later 
[21:39] stormagnet just got followed home by a shitty creep fucker AGAIN 
[21:40] and now they get to know which one is my apartment AGAIN 
[21:40] guitar.robot :( 
[21:42] stormagnet it's cool it's not like it's consequences YOU have to deal with 
[21:42] guitar.robot !  
[21:42] stormagnet only consequences attached to OOOH SHIT THE ONLY ACCESSIBLE APARTMENT I COULD GET 
[21:42] yeah I'm not going to be nice 
[21:42] guitar.robot could we talk about this with Dr P?  
[21:43] I think it would be good for both of us 
[21:43] stormagnet YES LET'S 
[21:43] guitar.robot I'll set up an appointment 
[21:43] I'm sorry I added to your stress today
