- Improvements
 - Executed more consistently (or at all in some cases)
  - That thing HabitRPG used to almost do for me
 - Resources (external, internal) devoted to said tasks reduced
  - Maybe find ways to make the tasks more efficient to execute?
 - Measured, monitored, alerting on threshold breech
  - The hardest but also most valuable improvement
 - Combine tasks with each other and with meta work
  - Add to journal at time of taking meds?

# Potential non-programmed steps forward
