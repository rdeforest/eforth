# Problems

- having a hard time getting myself to do stuff
  - call EAP
  - sell stock
  - file change of address (but I don't have a mailbox key yet anyway)
  - etc

- extremely difficult to be productive
  - but work understands

- money, maybe

# Not problems

- I'm sad but not depressed

# Next step

If at work and not able to focus record why, what's happening, my feelings, deep dive.

Maybe set aside some time for venting?

Look for a mindfulness app.

- The Mindfulness App
- Insight Timer
- Stop Read and Think
- Headspace
- Calm

Also a suggestion from Raine: https://www.dshs.wa.gov/ra/division-vocational-rehabilitation/what-services-are-available-me

# Evening feels

## lonely

Observations:

- used to being part of a team
- drinking isn't helping, but not drinking doesn't sound appealing either

Analysis:

- I have never been pro-active
- So why did I shy away from Raine?

Observations:

- Fear
  - of what?
- It feels bilogical/instinctual
