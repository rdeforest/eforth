Text in {brackets} is priority information. Children inherit priorities from
their parents, modified by their own priority information. +/- indicate
relative modification, = indicates absolute modification. Empty brackets {}
indicates "not applicable".

Missing braces inherit the derived priority of their parent. Non-empty braces
inherit the derived priority of their nearest ancestor with a non-empty spec.

Combined concepts describe how priorities combine (add, min/max, multiply,
override, etc).
