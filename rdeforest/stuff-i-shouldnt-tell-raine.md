I keep wanting to

- reach out to her with affection
- clarify the past
- make excuses
- take pictures and show her how tidy I can be

2017-05-18 - packing up my stuff

- I enjoyed cuddling Marco
- I worry about her hurting herself making up for my absence
- I miss her (many things here)
- There are so many things which are "mine" in that I brought them into the relationship, but which are "ours" because she made them better (stuffed animals, books, ...)
