## Raine comments

 - Things to watch for
  - Trouble speaking
  - Verbal cadence: "pressured speech"
  - Rumination
  - "fatalitic" about changing groups

 - Observations
  - Seasonal cycle
   - Projects start in spring, die off before end of year

## Results

 - Lithium fear
  - Two weeks is safe and all that's needed to determine efficacy
  - Mutual overwatch addresses "not knowing"

 - Theories
  - "tough time"
   - Dr. Lemberg not convinced?
   - Lexipro strikingly effective, followed by steady decline
   - ACTUALLY, we're trying to make tough times OK

 - Bi-polar

 - Lexipro did no harm
 - Prozac was terrible
 - Other Prozac was terrible

## next appointment

 - Reasons for scheduling an appointment sooner than next week
  - Seemingly worse off than baseline?
   - Is this actually true?
   - Can I re-establish a sustainable state?
  - Fear of Lithium
   - I try to live my life in a safe-by-default fashion and this plan as I
    know it does not meet that description.
   - Also the combination of lithium and needles triggers my phobias
  - Making the most of my six weeks off
   - How will I/we know I'm ready to go back?

 - Concerns about mind-altering substances
  - The past
   - Avoided alcohol, psychiatric medications
   - Was convinced to drink more than a little alcohol by someone who
    manipulated me (Daniel)
   - Convinced to take psychiatric medication by people who earned my trust
   - There were benefits to some of each
    - Alcohol turned out to be self-medication
    - Benefits of Vyvanse almost almost completely certain
   - Some fears came true
    - I didn't notice I was drinking too much, ignored feedback from others
    - Medication a factor in regretted behaviors of mine
  - Now
   - I haven't touched alcohol since July 17th
   - Partly recovered from January tail spin but not back on course yet
  - Want to re-baseline
   - I believe I was better off in 2014 than I am now.
    - Is this actually true? What do my graphs say?
   - To the degree that doing so is safe, I'd like to re-establish a safe
    holding pattern
    - I need to know how to safely stop all my medication in the event of
     a disaster of some sort (just knowing how should be enough)
    - I'd like to cease experimenting until I'm confident I can't get any
     better without experimenting
  - More information
   - My questions
    - ...
   - Subjects
    - Bi-polar, anxiety, depression, ...
    - Medications
   - Better (preferably still online) resources than Wikipedia, NIH
    - I'm not sure what 'better' means in this case
   - Recommended search terms?
   - Is it possible/likely that bi-polar symptoms could be triggered by
    stress and medication in a person who isn't naturally bi-polar?

 - Next steps
  - Starting next week I have six weeks
  - Does the exposure technique apply in this case?
   - How do I gradually expose myself to a scary medication?
   - How do I gradually expose myself to work?
  - How hard _should_ I plan?
   - Finding it hard to plan at all
  - How frequently should we meet?
