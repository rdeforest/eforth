## Motivations

- There's something she wants which
  - is worth risking consequences for
  - she doesn't want to expose (recreational substances, pregnancy tests, ...)
- Mind games
  - "Your money is more important to you than your daughter"
  - "Your rules don't apply to me"
  - "Please kick me out of the house so I can grow up"
