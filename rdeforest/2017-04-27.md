# The session

Structure

- logistics
- where we stand
- me wanting to clarify

## Raine has three pieces

- a statement
- thoughts
- logistics

### The Statement

My reactions

- I doubted her love
- I'm confident in her chances of mastering her patterns

### Raine's follow-up

- co-dependent patterns
- she figured something out that she struggled with for a long time

- She learned
  - she's good by herself
  - she feels more hopeful
  - she over-prioritizes others 
    - and wishes to master that
    - when she's alone there's nobody to do that for

## Where we stand

- Me
  - I want to be together

- Raine
  - hopes this will be good for me too

## Logistics

### Raine's needs

- co-sign "the" lease (which?)

- separation with ultimate divorce
  - divorce can include insurance
  - there's a courthouse service 

- communication
  - all online media are green-lit
  - ok hanging out, but not alone for now
  - not ok living together
  - I'm kinda on Nicole rules
    - I am allowed to tell Nicole about this

- finances
  - collaborate through slack

- Our stuff
  - I can come by whenever
  - ping in advance
