Kevin is crusing Walnut street looking for the girl Michele described to him.
Just as she had explained after brunch, Michele had helped him develop an
alter-ego, coached him on how to role-play safely and on how his charachter
could start and maintain a successful relationship with a character played by
the woman he would meet today.

He sees a girl approaching the intersection Michele had told him he'd meet her
at. Michele had said this woman would look young, but Kevin still wasn't
prepared. At the intersection he takes a right and parks. While he's taking
off his helmet the girl approaches him tentatively.

"Hi. Um, I'm kinda lost? Can you help me out?"

"Sure thing young lady. What're you looking for?"

"Um... I'm not sure. I'm kinda in a little trouble."

Kevin looks her up and down. "Do you want to go to a police station or
something?"

"No, they can't help me. I got myself emancipated a while back, and then I got
in a fight with my parents and they kicked me out. Then I lost my job. All my
older friends moved away when they graduated high school. I don't know what to
do."

"So you ask a scruffy guy on a motorcycle?"

The girl looks a little embarressed. "I'm not at my best right now."

"Huh. I guess it wouldn't be right to not help you out somehow. By the way, my
name's Jake." Kevin puts his right hand forward to shake the girl's hand.

The girl shake's Kevin's hand and says, "Stacie. Thanks mister. I was really
starting to panic."

"I don't blame you. I think the first thing to do is to get some food in you.
You look like you haven't been eating enough, if you don't mind my saying so.
As it happens, I came here to eat at this diner here." Kevin gets off the
motorcycle and gestures towards the diner.  "Can I buy you lunch?"

Stacie nods, "sure." She follows him inside and sit at a booth.

"Alright Stacie, let's sort this all out piece by piece..."
