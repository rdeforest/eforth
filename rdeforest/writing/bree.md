# Yes? What?

I was feeling super down and went down to Bait Shop around 23:00. I hung out
for a while and then learned that the woman sitting two seats down from me is
the drummer from Tacocat. I blurted out that I've had a huge crush on Bree for
seven years. She immediately asked if she could expose my secret. I had no
reason to say no. She took my picture and sent it to Bree who said that Raine
and I had always been sweet to her.

## Ok...

But the drummer (Lelah) wasn't done there and informed me of more Bree news.
She is recently single and needing of intimacy. Lelah also told me all Bree's
exes were a huge pain in Lelah's ass and that she had insisted that Bree has
to let her pick Bree's next lover. I started making "this guy" thumb motions
towards me and Lelah was nodding enthusiastically.

## So...

So now I'm waiting because Lelah is scheming to get this off to a good start.

# Um, I thought you had a thing for that Sarah woman...

I do! A person can have two crushes at once! It's a thing. Besides, I'm
French. Everyone knows about ... the French... Right?

# And then Marco died...
