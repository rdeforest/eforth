    This will be a banner month for your career, for so much of what you’ve
    worked to achieve is coming to fruition. For three years, you’ve been
    operating under the watchful gaze of Saturn, the taskmaster planet that
    taught you how to reach for the stars through hard work and dedication to
    ideals. During the past three years, you have had continual feedback from
    experienced people to sharpen your game. When Saturn first came to your
    tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement on December 23, 2014, you
    began your course of training. Think back to where you were then, and
    where you are now. See how far you’ve come, and how much valuable
    experience you’ve gained. You are very close to being able to put that
    knowledge to very good use.

Um, yeah...

    Saturn is leaving his position in Sagittarius this month on December 19 or
    20 (depending on your time zone) and is not due to return until 2044.
    Visits from Saturn in any one part of the chart are rare, as we only get
    two to three visits in each of the 12 sectors of our chart. Over the past
    three years, Saturn was on the angles of your chart, specifically the
    points that corresponds to the southernmost point in northern latitudes,
    and in southern latitudes, the northernmost point. In other words, Saturn
    has been on your mid-heaven point, the area of your reputation and
    contribution to your field and the world.

    Any planet that corresponds to the north, south, east, or west point on
    the compass acts super powerfully, like a wild stallion. Not only did you
    have Saturn, a planet known to strictly demand standards of excellence
    from you and concentration on your goal to the exclusion of everything
    almost everything else in the most important career sector of your chart,
    but with Saturn on an angle, he also acted with double strength.

...at the expense of my marriage, perhaps...

    My point in telling you this is that your life about to become smoother,
    easier, and less stressful when Saturn moves off that angle and into a
    gentler part of your solar chart. Saturn never sends rewards while the
    course of training is ongoing, but only after it is over. With Saturn
    leaving this month, you will receive your material or spiritual gift from
    Saturn as thanks to you for dealing with his vigorous training.

I wrote my "New Year, New Me" thing on Dec 3rd.

    The reason I feel you will not be quite get instant professional relief is
    that the powerful new moon of December 18 in the very same area of the
    chart that you and I have been discussing may bring you a big career offer
    in the days that follow this new moon. The new position would come with
    hefty, great responsibility, but also power and status too. If you are
    self-employed, it would come from a prestigious, respected client, and
    accepting the offer would surely boost your professional profile in your
    industry. There would be a lot of work to do, so keep that in mind when
    you state your fee.

Jason told me on the 4th that he has the head count situation taken care of
and is setting up the internal interview loop to get me to SysDE.

The new responsibility is that I will, without quesiton, be the most senior
engineer on the team. I may have more experience than the next two most
experienced engineers combined.

    You have your solar tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement packed
    with planets, with the Sun, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury, plus the Sun and
    new moon. Venus’ presence ensures everyone loves you, so go for the gold,
    because doors will swing open for you. The offer is likely to come to you
    this month,

I specifically told Jason I want to transition before the end of the year and
he said he could make it happen.
    
    within days or weeks of the new moon, and you may also get much publicity
    as well. You earned the acclaim you will receive now for all you learned
    and work you’ve done over the years working in your specialty. You are due
    for reward – this new assignment may be it.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this yet but it will probably become clear
soon.

    Last month Jupiter entered your ninth house of international places and
    relationships, and this is where the golden nuggets lie. Keep developing
    your contacts overseas, and this coming year, make it a point to actually
    get on a plane to schedule face-to-face meetings. This will benefit you
    more than you can imagine at this juncture. Happily, Mars has just entered
    the same part of your chart to energize this part of your life further.
    Both Mars and Jupiter are in Scorpio, in loving angle to your Pisces Sun.
    You could not wish for a better situation. Mars will remain in your ninth
    house from December 9 to January 26.

I was _already_ planning to travel after accepting Jason's offer. Now I have
to. :)

    If you don’t do any work with executives in foreign countries, there are
    other areas that are percolating along and could be equally profitable for
    you. Those include any work having to do with academia, whether you are
    going back to school to get your advanced degree or catering to the
    college market.

See afore-mentioned New Me doc.

    You also will benefit from publishing and broadcasting companies. All the
    years while Saturn was in Sagittarius (until this month, December 19/20)
    magazines and television networks struggled to deal with challenges, but
    those companies are about to recover now that the shakeout caused by
    Saturn is complete. They had to reinvent themselves, and they did. The
    weak companies have since fallen by the wayside, and the future is bright.

    Sagittarius rules these fields, but Saturn is now leaving and heading to
    Capricorn. (The next field to go through the throws of change, requiring
    sweeping adjustment, will be the banking industry, ruled by Capricorn.)

Not about me specifically, but: net neutrality and blockchain currencies
anyone?

    If you are a lawyer or regularly do legal moves (such as to file a
    trademark, in your own country or overseas), you will do well too. All
    legal matters will favor you because you have such benefic aspects.

Time to get that separation paperwork underway...

    Two days I would like you to keep on your radar are January 5 and 6 when
    Mars and Jupiter will combine forces in conjunction. If you hope to
    travel, I would love you to be on foreign shores on at least one of those
    two days.

I think that can be arranged. Perhaps a trip back to Puerta Vajarta?

    This month Mercury will be retrograde from December 3 to 22 in the sign of
    Sagittarius in your tenth house of career reputation. For this reason, I
    hope you can wait to give your final answer to offers for a new position,
    promotion, or new client until after Christmas or in January. Mercury will
    obfuscate the description of what you will be expected to do, so you do
    need to wait. The very fact that Mercury is retrograde is a signal that
    the wind is changing direction, and for now, there’s no indication of
    which way things are headed.

Oh noes!

    There is one exception to the rule not to give a final answer to any new
    offers while Mercury is retrograde, and that is if you hear from a person
    or company that you used to work with in the past, who wants to reconnect
    with you and do something together now. If that should happen, you are
    free to move forward. You are not starting a new relationship, but rather
    continuing one started previously, which apparently was very successful.

Oh, it's fine then. I talked with a previous manager of InfAuto about moving
to the team but ended up going to Edge instead. Then there's the whole Bruce
connection too.

    Or, it may be you impressed a top level person a long time ago but somehow
    the offer didn’t work out for any number of reasons, but now you may
    finally work together. Anytime you go back to the past you are pleasing
    Mercury in retrograde.

    Holiday shopping is going to be a problem this month, so save receipts and
    avoid buying electronics, appliances, a car, or machine with moving parts.
    Mercury rules these products, so either you may be disappointed by how the
    item functions, or, because Mercury retrograde often causes our judgment
    to fail, you may choose the wrong model. It is also possible you may pay
    too much when other retailers are selling that product for substantially
    less.

    There are so many reasons to hold off your purchase until the very last
    week of December or until January. If you would like to know more about
    Mercury retrograde, you can read my essay, All You Need to Know About
    Mercury Retrograde that is found on my homepage of my website. It is also
    found on the premium subscriber edition of my app, Susan Miller’s
    Astrology Zone Daily Horoscope. Go to the menu and look under Life, Love +
    Move, and look under Susan’s Essays, and you will find my article on
    Mercury retrograde.

    Saturn moves to Capricorn for the first time since 1988 to 1991 on
    December 19/20 and settles into that sign for the coming three years,
    until December 17, 2020, you will start to become more involved with your
    community and friendships will become more important to you. You won’t
    feel the career pressures you did in 2015, 2016, and 2017, but now the
    attention will turn to your friends and contacts. You experience your
    greatest personal growth by being sensitive to others, whether as part of
    a group, working to help raise funds and awareness for a humanitarian goal
    or one that involves a charity, or you may work in more of a one-on-one
    way, to help a dear friend.

    You may soon notice your friend is suddenly going through a difficult
    patch and will need your support. This will be especially apparent at the
    time Saturn conjoins the Sun on December 21. Perhaps your friend recently
    moved to your city and has not had time to meet new people, or does not
    have family nearby to celebrate the holidays. With everyone going to
    parties and dinners, your friend may feel isolated, alone, and left out.
    If possible, invite your friend to your family’s festivities to help your
    friend fully partake of the season’s joy.

    Speaking of family, your own home and family will be a big focus at the
    full moon on December 3 in Gemini 12 degrees, plus or minus four days. You
    may go to a family reunion, or go to a large party that has many family
    members present, such as would happen at a wedding or engagement party.
    Going to a party would be a good way to use this energy, because Neptune
    will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, veiling reality and
    creating a dreamlike experience for you to enjoy.

    Jupiter and Neptune will be in exact harmony over this weekend, December
    2-3, and that graceful aspect will help to create a heavenly experience.
    The party or benefit would likely be beautiful and quite luxurious, with
    soft lighting, flowers, and a lyrical tone – something very memorable
    seems to be in the making.

    Amazingly, both Jupiter and Neptune are your rulers, dear Pisces, and
    whenever they are in sync, as they will be over that weekend, you are in
    line to benefit in an outstanding way. Jupiter and Neptune will stay in
    collaboration during most of 2018, so you have a great year to look
    forward to next year.

    If you are buying a house, vacation cottage, or condo, or renting one, or
    buying furniture, hiring a contractor, or making a final decisions on
    behalf of an elderly parent or other relative, I worry that Neptune will
    cloak reality with his mist, pretty to look at but problematic when trying
    to see all the facts. Home and family-related decisions usually require an
    outlay of quite a bit of money, and I feel too many pieces of information
    will be missing to make an informed choice. Keep in mind also that
    Mercury, the thinking planet, will be retrograde, so that adds to the
    confusion prevalent in early December.

    Let’s talk about romance now. This month has a strong career accent, but
    next month, in January, you will have an exceptionally social time. You
    will be out and about meeting many new people, with plenty of chances for
    romantic episodes too.

    Even though this month does not hold a candle to the exciting events and
    people you will meet next month, you will have time for fun and love in
    December. It won’t be all work and no play, dear Pisces. You will be
    supported by Mars in Scorpio, Jupiter in Scorpio, and Neptune in Pisces –
    three trifecta planets that will boost your magnetism sky high. It’s an
    exciting time to be you!

    Summary

    You are about to enter a month poised to reward you for all the hard work
    and good judgment you have displayed in your career over the past years.
    You may be promoted or given an offer from a competitive firm, or if you
    are self-employed, you may bring in a new, prestigious client. Much will
    be given to you, but much will be expected of you too – beyond anything
    you might have estimated. If you do get an offer after December 18, the
    job will be a highly responsible position that will require quite a bit of
    your attention, but that would have the power to put you on top of the
    mountain.

    Your background and experience has prepared you for your new role and you
    will be up to the task, even if it will require a strenuous effort and
    great concentration. You may be a little hesitant to take it (it’s due to
    be that big), but if you can ask many questions and give your answer in
    the very last week of December or in January to separate yourself as FAR
    as possible from the period Mercury will be retrograde (December 3 to 22),
    then it seems to be the kind of offer you used to dream about getting.

    Most people try to work right up against the retrograde period to the day
    before the beginning (December 3) and the day after the end dates
    (December 22). That is not a good idea, for the first and last days of a
    Mercury retrograde are actually the worst days, causing the most
    confusion. Certainly you would not want to build that energy into the DNA
    of your new venture. The only exception to the rule is to work with
    someone you used to know, and perhaps lost contact with (or not), and will
    now join forces to work on a new project or job.

    For three years, since December 2014, you have been under the stern eye of
    Saturn, while Saturn toured your tenth house of honors, awards, and
    achievement. You were asked to meet higher standards than you were
    familiar with doing, but you worked with Saturn’s demands, you are now
    about to step into a role that is bigger than any you’ve held before. It
    could be quite a memorable moment when your reward comes.

    Good fortune planet Jupiter is touring your ninth house of foreign people
    and places, so people abroad hold one of your keys to future success.
    Alternatively, the same ninth house that is so lit up also rules
    opportunities in the media, including publishing and broadcasting as well
    as the digital world. Jupiter will receive silvery beams from Neptune,
    your ruling planet, making the industries listed outstanding sources of
    profit and growth.

    With Saturn entering your eleventh house of friendships and groups, you
    will now experience your biggest personal growth through working with your
    present friends and by making new friends too. If you ever wanted to join
    a club and get active, the coming three years would be the time to do it.
    You will be given the chance to make your mark by making the world a
    better place, all because of you.

    Romance will be better for you next month, for this month will focus you
    strongly on your career. Action-hero Mars, however, will be your friend,
    and by month’s end, Mars’ closeness to Jupiter suggests that you may
    decide to travel to foreign shores to ring in the New Year. Go for it,
    dear Pisces – the memory you build will last a lifetime.
