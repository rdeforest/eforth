Trying not to think about work, so logging things in hopes of getting them out of my head.

# Progress in avoiding panic-inducing thoughts and thought cycles

## 2016-01-23

- OK through most of the day, started having trouble around 18:30
  - "Author of PIP is irrelevant if its development and contents lack structure and objectivity"
  - then drifting into hypothetical conversations in which I'm defending myself
- Craving alcohol as much as I did spending a weekend with Ben and Amie

- Woke up thinking about work: Tier-0 vs Tier-N work
  - Definitions
    - Tier 0 is the 'last mile' of productivity
      - Personal maintenance (hygene, eating, etc)
      - Commuting
      - Tier 0 work will always exist
      - Everyone has to do at least a little Tier 0 work
    - Improving Tier N is Tier N+1 work
      - decides the metrics
      - sets up measurements
      - optimizes for them by imposing changes to
        - Processes (workflows)
        - Resource allocation
        - Tools
        - Techniques
        - Process Parameters (distances, shapes, durations, times of day, ...)
  - Assertions/Observations
    - To maximize Tier 0 work we need Tier 1 work, and so on to infinity
      - Without Tier 1 we'd be hunter-gathers AND we'd be bad at it
    - Tier N + 1 cannot eliminate Tier N
      - In doint so its number and the tiers above it would decrement by 1
    - Each higher level of work is harder and more expensive to measure than the last
    - There is an optimum amount of Tier N+1 work, but finding that optimum is Tier N+2 work
      - The optima change over time with changes in context
  - Example: Payments and the Project Rubric
    - The work
      - Tier 0
	- Operations, Daily (KTLO, KTLF, KTL)
	  - Troubleshooting measured threshold breeches
	  - Replacing broken equipment
	  - Troubleshooting stuck batches
	  - Hassling payment processors to unstick batches
	  - Hassling Seals, Beach, or whomever to unstick batches
	- Operations, Long-ish term, still tier 0
	  - Scaling to demand (defined by Beach and Pint)
	  - Patching and upgrades
	  - Building in new regions (PEK - where I had a notable miss)
      - Tier 1
	- Operations
	  - Correcting monitoring for accuracy and consistancy
	  - Ticket queue hygiene
	- Project work
	  - Patching tool
	  - Fixing build automation
	  - Re-implementing access controls
	  - Apollo integration (thanks tristanc@!)
      - Tier 2
	- Hiring and training
	- Daily stand-up meetings
	- Weekly planning meetings
    - The Rubric 
      - History: a fateful trip to Dublin
    - The results:
      - Ticket Evaluation process
	- Process for Challenging Evaluations
	- Rubric modification process
      - Processing backlog (~90 sec / ticket)

Stuff from Raine:

> "It's what you value, so de-valuing it is like a personal attack"
>  - Raine

She also points out that there may be a way to have this love without being vulnerable to it.
Or maybe there's a way someone can not value it as I do and for me to not be as upset by this as I am.
  "Decoupling" my relationship with Tier N work from my ... feelings?

To address my hand-waving, ask the other party to describe back to me what I have said.
