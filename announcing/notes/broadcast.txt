This past week a sequence of events convincing me that my relationship with
alcohol was interfering with my relationships and work. This is unacceptable
to me, so I am now (7/16-7/21) undergoing a detoxification process.

I will separately reach out to everyone I can think of whom I may have wronged
in the last three years regardless of whether I believe alcohol to have been a
factor and clear the air with them.

My past behaviors are not excused by my realization or my confession. I will
work to correct any past mistakes I made.

I do not expect anyone to take action on my behalf. I appreciate whatever
support any of you wish to offer, but you are under no obligation. I have to
lie in the bed I made.
