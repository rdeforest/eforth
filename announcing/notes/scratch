    - don't ask me what I miss most
    - don't ask how stopping drinking is going

Q&A

; Are you OK?
: Yes. I'm following a doctor-prescribed detoxification process and I have
very high confidence that I will be successful. I had been adamantly against
drinking until I was in my mid-twenties and I am eager to regain what I've
lost since then. I've made progress on the anxiety and depression which I will
not lose by removing alcohol from my life.

; Is this "forever"?
: I don't deal in absolutes. This is "going forward", just like my marriage.

; What about alcohol in food?
: I'm not concerned, but will avoid powerful deserts on principle. Nobody need
adjust their 

; What was the turning point?
: I was so dramatically surprised by the inconsistencies in my memories and
perceptions that I went to the ER. A two-hour conversation with a social worker

aren't worth the risks it brings along. I had three people either directly or
indirectly invalidate my assumptions about my relationships with them or the
nature of our shared reality.
