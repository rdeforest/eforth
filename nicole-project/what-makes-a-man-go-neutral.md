# The Monks of Neutrality

If you trace a wire inside a city to a room with quiet screens, you may slip
into the realm of information.  This realm, being higher contrast than our
own, is governed by light and dark.  Where tiny pulses of electricity form
words and images, those who keep the balance are the monks of neutrality.

On the street, they could be anybody.  You might notice them only by their
silence.  Attuned to noise as failure, the monks prefer austere living.  They
order sound into music and pauses.  At night, if you listen carefully, you may
hear a monk practicing his trade, be it guitar, flute or saxophone.  The monks
always practice but never perform for that is their prayer: to be always
becoming.

At night
