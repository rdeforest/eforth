# Combining ontology nodes

Or perhaps more accurately, applying them to each other.

## Objectives

- Ability to "program" my organization system
  - Combine orthogonal entities
    - Life Cycle + Self => Personal improvement
    - Life Cycle + Guitar => Music hobbie
    - Communication + Friends + Tools => Chat, Email, etc
- Combinations may themselves be abstract and combinable
- Combinations have
  - derived and/or specified priorities
  - zero or more
    - cycles
    - projects
    - issues
- I'd like this to all be actually programmed {-}
  - persisted
  - queryable
  - editable
  - rendered
  - dynamic
- System should be "simple" {+}
  - Low friction
  - High availability
  - Cheap
  - "Loose" / "Flexible" (not sure what I'm saying here)
