		[15:31] 
		stormagnet Somebody, presumably Livible, just tried to buzz up- I missed the call

		[15:33] 
		guitar.robot Yeah. They said you told them I'd be early, heh. Anyway, I'm on it

		[15:34] 
		They are already done with the drop off

		[15:39] 
		They cashed me at 15:12 to say they were 10 minutes away. I told ten I would cancel my lunch and meet them at the front door in ten minutes. At 15:23 I was a block away, carrying a quesadilla in a box because it was too late to cancel, and they texted me that they were there. They were at the front door if your apartment on the fourth floor, where I had meant the front door if the building. Surprise! Anyway, all done now

		[15:40] 
		The delivery I mean.

		[17:49] 
		stormagnet ugh, sorry about that

		[17:51] 
		guitar.robot Aw, it's fine, I was enjoying making it out to be more than it was. Don't worry about it. Also ask and I just left so you're all set

		[17:53] 
		I am going to send Dr P a note about stuff so if she reaches your to you that might be why but if not she decided it wasn't helpful or something

		[17:53] 
		Ugh. Ignore that please

		[17:55] 
		Also I parked out front because I embibed

		[18:25] 
		guitar.robot ugh, typos. "Al and I just left", "she reaches out to you". But yeah, strike all of the above other than I'm not at your apartment and all is well

		[21:38] 
		stormagnet no Ok srsly

		[21:38]
