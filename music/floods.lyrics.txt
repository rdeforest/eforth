(mid,low)
A dead issue,
don't wrestle with it,
deaf ears are sleeping 
A guilty bliss,
so inviting (let me in),
(mid,harmoy)
nailed to the cross 

(high)
I feel you, 
relate you, 
accuse you 

(mid)
Wash away us all, 
take us with the floods 

(low)
Then throughout the night,
they were raped and executed 

(low)
Cold hearted world 

(mid,low)
Your language
unheard of,
the vast sound of tuning out 
The rash of negativity
is seen one sidedly,
(mid,harmoy)
burn away the day 

(high)
The nervous, 
the drifting, 
the heaving 

(mid)
Wash away us all, 
take us with the floods 

(low)
Then throughout the day 
mankind played with grenades 

(mid)
Cold hearted world 

(low)
And at night
they might bait the pentagram 

(mid, harmony)
Extinguishing the sun 

(mid)
Wash away man, 
take him with the floods

(low)
Fly, fly, fly...
Fly, fly, fly...

[solos]

(low)
Fly, fly, fly...
Fly, fly, fly...
