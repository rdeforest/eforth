Hand on the wall
Lost any way

Plenty of options
They're all the same

Over my shoulder
The way that I came

Looks no different
But who can say?

I know where I am
I know where this ends

Not today


Who built these walls?
Blocking the view?

Why have a ceiling
That drizzles and drips?

Where are the markings
To guide me through?

What kind of person
Dreams up these trips?

Can I get out?
Should I even try?

Not today


C                    G
I could run... probably

C                    G
I could dig... probably

Bb                  Am
I can sing... I can cry...

C                   D
I can live... I can die...

Em
Not today




You made me cry so hard I laughed
