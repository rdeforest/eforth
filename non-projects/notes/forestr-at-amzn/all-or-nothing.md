# The letter I want to write

Erin,

When we first spoke I stated that I did not feel competent to represent
myself. That was true then, but I realized over the course of the last two
weeks that it will continue to be true indefinitely as long as all related
communication continues to be untraceable. I am therefore asking that we
continue to pursue this matter via email going forward.

In our meeting on Feb 3rd you posed two questions to me:

  1) When can I return to normal work
  2) What accommodations, if any, would I need

I am now able to answer both of these without consulting with my doctor.

I can work at full capacity as soon as

  - Amazon acknowledges to me and my leadership that I was mistreated
  - Amazon denounces and rectifies my mistreatment
  - Amazon explicitly acknowledges 
    - untracerable communication as irrelevant to performance assessment.
    - absence of evidence is not evidence of absence

I will need no accommodations. If any of the above is considered an
accommodation, I will seek work elsewhere instead.  I will not support in any
way an organization which tolerates the kind of treatment I experienced since
joining Edge Services.

If my clarification is not itself a deal-breaker in some sense, then the next
step is to commence mediation. On further reflection, I don't think Andy would be
an appropriate mediator. I am making claims which, though he was not
personally involved, could impact him negatively if substantiated. No matter
what his intentions, he cannot be impartial.

I will not need a Leave of Absence. I am ready to commence mediation Monday
and if it's going to take long enough that I need an LoA then I don't even
want to start.

# Super snark

Where in "customer obsessed" is the part about asking the customer when
they're going to be calm enough to resume being a customer?
