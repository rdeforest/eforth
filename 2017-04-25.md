notes from Dr. L

- Scheduled mandatory-participation safe context for discussing relationship stuff

What I want out of Thursday

- to be heard?
- How to feel close?

- to know if it is me or the security she wants...

Transform "yes or no" questions into "how" questions

- In what ways does she value me?
  - more about me or my actions?
- How does she view my weaknesses?

I should answer the same question about her
