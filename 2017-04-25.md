notes from Dr. L

- Scheduled mandatory-participation safe context for discussing relationship stuff

What I want out of Thursday

- to be heard?
- How to feel close?

- In what ways does she value me?
  - more about me or my actions?
- How does she view my weaknesses?

I should answer the same question about her

- What about her do I value
  - insight
  - tenderness
  - bravery
- How do I value it...
  - badly

- How do I view her "weaknessess"?
  - physical: immediate, surmountable
