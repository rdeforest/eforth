If I made a new wiki platform...

  * Link syntax like unix including meaning of ., .. and /
  * Markdown for syntax
  * Automatically turn external links to internal if possible
    * but offer an override for those rare cases
  * when pages move
    * default to no redirect
    * default to updating internal links where possible
  * Data model
    * links are by object ID, not name
      * updating links when pages move is also O(1)
    * page names are derived
      * moving a hierarchy is O(1)
    * links are two directional:
      * 'what links here' is O(N) by number of inbound links
    * Oh crap this is starting to sound like a file system...
      * And this is bad because... ?
      * Use a file system for persistence
      * Use git for version control
      * Each page is a directory
      * page data is in .wiki/
      * The '.wiki' name is prohibited to simplify implementation
        * requests for it return 4XX
        * requests to create pages named .wiki are denied
        * Actually, periods are entirely prohibited in page names
  * No Foo: namespacing
    * Regular wiki content in /w
    * Config in /etc (because yay unix!)
    * Templates in /bin (because yay unix!)
    * Users in /home (etc)
    * etc
    * Will this confuse/irritate people? HELL YEAH! :)
  * / is read-only to normal users
  * Access control based on ACLs or capabilities or something
    * /home/* and /group/* can be members of /ACL pages
