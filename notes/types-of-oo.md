# Meta Object Protocol notes

Trying to reconstruct that paper about the N different types of
object-orientation.

# Object Oriented definition elements

## Encapsulation

Separation/isolation of interface and implementation.

### Explicit Interface Declaration

### Member setter/getter functions

### unknown method handling

## Poly-morphism

User of an object does not need to know the exact type of the object. The
object's behavior is modulated by its type(s).

    "one" + "two" isnt 1 + 2

### Operator overriding

### Type coercion

## Inheritance

### Behavior inheritance

### State inheritance

## Mix-in/Role
