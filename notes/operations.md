# A POA talk I might give some day

Applying familiar IT practices to human problems:
  Treating humans like processes

## Intro

In 40 minutes I will open the floor to questions. Most, if not all of you will
be thinking, "he didn't tell me anything I didn't already know." That is true.
The purpose of my talk is not to convey what I have learned from my mistakes,
but to provide you with tools for applying your own wisdom to problems you may
not realize that wisdom can address.

## Examples: Things you already know

### You have to have a way to measure something before you can improve it

- Test driven everything
- Monitoring everything, sort out the important stuff later
- Alerting when it gets bad
- Reporting before it gets bad

### Sometimes a little new complexity can replace a lot of old complexity

- Interface abstraction
- Metadata facilitates interface decoupling
- Minimize special cases (prefer loops to conditionals)
- Namespaces?
- Encapsulation?

### Change management

- Know and mitigate your risks
- Keep changes small
- Keep rollback simple, safe and easy

# Some other stuff

- Use just enough structure and no more
- Be liberal in what you accept and strict in what you produce
- Learn from mistakes
- Learn from successes
- Anything can be programmable
- Minimize friction for cooperation
  - Sane defaults
  - Optimize for laziness of all participants
