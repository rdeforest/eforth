Hello,

I am writing to recommend Nicole Bade as instructor for EE 393.

I started working in Information Technology (IT) in the spring of 1996 and am
now in the middle of my third year at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com). 

At Disney we worked together directly in the System Operations Center and less
directly after I transitioned to the Platform Engineering team. On that team
I relied on Nicole in her capacity as a member of the SOC, which supported all
the System Engineering teams by driving adoption of ITIL processes and best
practices, and by providing Incident Management services. After Nicole moved
on to FHCRC her influence continued to benefit me because the SOC used an
onboarding document Nicole had written to train all their new team members.
Nicole later convinced me to join her at FHCRC where she and her team managed
the infrastructure my systems relied on.

Working with Nicole has always been a pleasure. Nicole provides a practical,
clear, calm focus on identifying and addressing the most urgent concerns in a
relatively young field often in dire need of such focus. Her clear
communication and calm demeanor built immense trust between her own teams and
the teams they supported. That level of trust made my work easier because I
could rely on Nicole's teams and because the other teams I worked with had
also benefited from Nicole's team's support.
