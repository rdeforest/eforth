# Inspired by Fallout 4, among other things

Resource management/politics game

Player has a population of workers they manage
Workers have wants, needs, aspirations

Time is the fundamentally limited resource, but there are also resources that
have to be obtained to improve things

Utilities have
- an acquisition price
- a depreciation rate
- a base maintenance cost
- additional cost based on use

Numbers like costs are multi-variable functions:
- acquisition cost
  - how long willing to wait for a given price
  - negotiation skill
  - contacts
  - ...
- maintenance cost
  - maintenance policy/practice
  - maintenance skill
  - "overrev" = pushing people and things "too hard"

Information presented to the player has a confidence level which behaves like the reticles in FPS games which show approximately where bullets shot will probably go. When the player asks "how much would X decision cost" they get the answer in the form of a probabiliy graph. The higher the confidence, the narrower the bell curve.

Part of the game is in coming up with good org charts

It should be possible to try out the four-color management system

That means NPCs need to have similiar interaction with the world to what the PC has. They have resources to allocate, goals, etc.

# Examples

## Bottom management

PC has 3-30 direct reports who are all individual contributors. 

The choices of the ICs are

- Self
  - work (execute, practice, research)
- Peers/Superiors
  - tell (including lying? rumors? maybe?) - costs receivers time
  - ask (information, resource, action)
  - listen (must allocate time to inbound communication)
    - subscribe/unsubscribe
    - catch-up
  - collaborate (brainstorm, ...?)

The choices of managers are the same as ICs plus

- Delegates
  - recruit
  - develop
  - guidance/feedback
- Peers
  -
