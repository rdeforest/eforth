# Notes inspired by LorenRPG

## What kind of game is it?

* Turn based
* RPG (in the sense that player partly controls char development and actions)
* Fantasy setting
* Combat (melee & range)

## What makes these kinds of games fun?

* Player input
  * Strategy
    * Party make-up (completementary ability development)
  * Tactics
    * Combos (status affliction + attack benefitting from affliction)
    * Heal ally or attack enemy
  * Dialog trees?

## What's wrong with this one?

* Party member location arrangement barely matters
  * Middle = focus of AOE
  * Left vs Right side are meaningless except for who gets hit by strike-through
* Simplistic world navigation makes world seem small
* Mechanics don't adequately take char traits into account?
  * Loren should not experience the fear effect in her fourth arena battle with the town guards. COME ON.
* Insufficient variety in skill trees and art

## Ideas

* Hex grid
  * Suburbia-style perks and drawbacks
    * Adjacent
      * Adjacent enemies hamper range and magic activities
      * Certain classes benefit from adjacent enemies
      * Most classes benefit from adjacent allies
    * Own team
      * Magic that buffs whole team
    * Other team
      * Magic that debuffs other team
    * Any/all
      * Certain characters/spells fed by anyone having certain trait or status
* Certain weapons have ideal ranges
  * Pole-arms are reach weapons (hello D&D)
  * Daggers are adjacent only for melee, > 1 dist for throwing

## Innovations

* Small hexes
  * Maybe 10cm?
  * Hex size is small enough to be FOOT location.
    * Facing takes foot locations into account
    * Actions include foot placement
      * User does not HAVE to micro-manage these things
  * Normal humanoids take up multiple hexes.
