# Customers

  - Lookout Team
    - Reduce ticket pain, unnecessary effort and interruptions

  - Lookout Customers
    - Reduce time-to-response, time-to-close

# Measures of (ultimate) success

(Does not apply to review process.)

  - Ticket age reduction
    - Implies less time spent revisiting the same ticket
  - Incident frequency reduction
    - Implies less time spent working tickets at all
    - Exclude opened-as-closed tickets used for tracking? Are there any?
  - Service Call response time reduction
    - Implies improved customer experience

# Plan

  - Institute review process (Can Bruce's tool help me here?)
    - Mass-tag current tickets as "unreviewed"
      - (pretty sure there's a trick for this)
    - Incidents
      - Is/was the incident actionable?
        - If so, could the issue have been prevented?
        - If not, could the ticket have been prevented without hiding real problems?
      - Is this a recurring incident?
    - Service call
      - Could the customer have solved their own issue?
      - How long did the customer wait between their updates and ours?
      - Is this a recurring request?

  - Start additional work based on ticket review

  - Consider continuing development of one-at-a-time ticket tool
