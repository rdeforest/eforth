# MVP

  - Rich's dev box
  - deconfigure display manager
  - Setup daemon to run X and run Chrome in it in non-interactive mode
    - Monitor Chrome and X somehow (?) and restart them as needed
  - Simple HTML page 
    - iframe for each displayed page
    - scripting to flip through them
    - refresh frames while they're in the background to hide page load times

## Proof of concept

  - Just the HTML page with
    - Lookout ops dashboard (the fancy map page)
    - tt, sim
      - Graph of ticket counts (by sev, age, etc)
      - top N tickets
