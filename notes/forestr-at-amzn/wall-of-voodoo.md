    - Talking point: "So what exactly would you say you do here?"
    - Demonstration of prowess: "Wow, you manage all that with only X people?"

## Press Release

  "Lookout Operations and Development Proudly Announces Its Wall of Voodoo"

  ...

# MVP

  - Rich's dev box
  - deconfigure display manager
  - Setup daemon to run X and run Chrome in it in non-interactive mode
    - Monitor Chrome and X somehow (?) and restart them as needed
  - Simple HTML page 
    - iframe for each displayed page
    - scripting to flip through them
    - refresh frames while they're in the background to hide page load times

## Proof of concept

  - Just the HTML page with
    - Lookout ops dashboard (the fancy map page)
    - top N tickets in tt
    - top N items in sim

# Outstanding questions

  - How will we measure success?
    - "Rich and Andy love it"?
