# Customers

  - Lookout Team
    - Reduce ticket pain, unnecessary effort and interruptions
  - Lookout Customers
    - Reduce time-to-response, time-to-close

# Plan

  - Mass-tag current tickets as "unreviewed"
    - (pretty sure there's a trick for this)
  - Institute review process (Can Bruce's tool help me here?)
    - Incidents
      - Is/was the incident actionable?
        - If so, could the issue have been prevented?
        - If not, could the ticket have been prevented without hiding real problems?
      - Is this a recurring incident?
    - Service call
      - Could the customer have solved their own issue?
      - How long did the customer wait between their updates and ours?
      - Is this a recurring request?
