# Working on DRT team

## The Good

* People
  * Atulya
    * Trustworthy
    * Experienced
  * Dennis
    * Patient, Kind
    * Good instincts (humans limit scaling)
  * Jeff
    * Learning fast

## The Bad

* People
  * Atulya
    * Favoring face-to-face communication
    * "Are you with us or not"
      * How about some concrete expecations instead?
    * He was wrong about Tuesday
  * Jeff
    * Not getting the "humans limit scaling" problem
    * Obsessed with the immediate future to the exclusion of most else

## The Ugly

* People
  * Atulya
    * He's even working himself too hard


## Other

Atulya is trying to run DRT like a startup. That might be ok for others, but
it's terrible for me.


# The team in the abstract

- Definition
  - No formal spec that I am aware of?
  - Informal spec (OP1) is using wrong metrics
- Strategy/tactics

## My advice

- Definition
  - Mission: Maximize value of AWS through incremental infrastructure
    improvements related to gracefully tolerating unwanted external network
    activity.
  - Tenets:
    - Minimize impact on ALL customers
      - Attack targets should not have to interact with DevSupport to restore
        service. Common cases should all have self-service options.
      - Minimize work and system impact on network peers and transit
        providers. 
      - Minimize interruptions and work created for internal teams.
    - Advance the Art
      - Tools, models, tools
    - Trust customers by default
      - Manage risk, but all other things being equal, assume all agents are
        operating in good faith.
      - Offer and loudly advertise self service tools
    - Continuous improvement
      - Define the bar
      - Measure it
      - When passing it is normal, THEN raise it.
    - Synergize
      - reduce reduant work across teams and share solutions to problems
  - Strategies
    - Integrate ALL risks and costs into Networking cost model
      - Identify and measure impact (in $/t) of
        - unsolicited network traffic
        - all our current and potential future responses or system changes
      - Customer research
      - 
  - Tactics
