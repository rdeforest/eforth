# Program, not project

Lookout is in POPs to gather data which is used by many teams to respond to
changes in network traffic and to make business decisions.

# Measures of success

  - Reduce
    - Change execution time
    - Manual steps
    - Incidents caused by POP management changes or errors

# POP life cycle

  - Add
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - Monitoring
    - Documentation
  - Maintain
    - Adapt to changing context and new knowledge
      - Troubleshoot: internal or external change invalidated assumptions
      - Change config
      - Change software
      - Change hardware
    - Learn
      - Compare predictions to reality, feed surprises into adaption
  - Retire

(None of the above is necessarily POP-specific. Should probably abstract it
out to some meta-doc.)

# Todo

  - Understand how POPs are managed now (docs, tools)

# Ideas/scratch

  - CMDB: 
    - What do we have and why?
    - How do we know our config is good?
      - What is good? (80% util?)
