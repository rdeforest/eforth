Trying not to think about work, so logging things in hopes of getting them out of my head.

# Progress in avoiding panic-inducing thoughts and thought cycles

- OK through most of the day, started having trouble around 18:30
  - "Author of PIP is irrelevant if its development and contents lack structure and objectivity"
  - then drifting into hypothetical conversations in which I'm defending myself

- Woke up thinking about work: Tier-0 vs Tier-N work
  - Definitions
    - Tier 0 is the 'last mile' of productivity
      - Personal maintenance (hygene, eating, etc)
      - Commuting
      - Tier 0 work will always exist
      - Everyone has to do at least a little Tier 0 work
    - Improving Tier N is Tier N+1 work
      - decides the metrics
      - sets up measurements
      - optimizes for them by imposing changes to
        - Processes (workflows)
        - Resource allocation
        - Tools
        - Techniques
        - Process Parameters (distances, shapes, durations, times of day, ...)
  - Assertions/Observations
    - To maximize Tier 0 work we need Tier 1 work, and so on to infinity
      - Without Tier 1 we'd be hunter-gathers AND we'd be bad at it
    - Tier N + 1 cannot eliminate Tier N
      - In doint so its number and the tiers above it would decrement by 1
    - Each higher level of work is harder and more expensive to measure than the last
    - There is an optimum amount of Tier N+1 work, but finding that optimum is Tier N+2 work
      - The optima change over time with changes in context
  - Example: Payments and the Project Rubric
    - The work
      - Tier 0
	- Operations, Daily (KTLO, KTLF, KTL)
	  - Troubleshooting measured threshold breeches
	  - Replacing broken equipment
	  - Troubleshooting stuck batches
	  - Hassling payment processors to unstick batches
	  - Hassling Seals, Beach, or whomever to unstick batches
	- Operations, Long-ish term, still tier 0
	  - Scaling to demand (defined by Beach and Pint)
	  - Patching and upgrades
	  - Building in new regions (PEK - where I had a notable miss)
      - Tier 1
	- Operations
	  - Correcting monitoring for accuracy and consistancy
	  - Ticket queue hygiene
	- Project work
	  - Patching tool
	  - Fixing build automation
	  - Re-implementing access controls
	  - Apollo integration (thanks tristanc@!)
      - Tier 2
	- Hiring and training
	- Daily stand-up meetings
	- Weekly planning meetings
    - The Rubric 
      - History: a fateful trip to Dublin
    - The results:
      - Ticket Evaluation process
	- Process for Challenging Evaluations
	- Rubric modification process
      - Processing backlog (~90 sec / ticket)

Stuff from Raine:

> "It's what you value, so de-valuing it is like a personal attack"
>  - Raine

She also points out that there may be a way to have this love without being vulnerable to it.
Or maybe there's a way someone can not value it as I do and for me to not be as upset by this as I am.
  "Decoupling" my relationship with Tier N work from my ... feelings?

To address my hand-waving, ask the other party to describe back to me what I have said.

- meeting with Erin Page
  - Disconnect/decouple
    - Separate ME from WORK
    - Especially between ME and JEFF
    - I will come back and focus on my job

I'm following up again today because an article on Ars Technica about Disney led me to refine my model of Jeff. My hope in relating this to you is that it will aid you in facilitating the most amicable resolution to the conflict. Regardless it will at least be a load off my mind to know I expressed myself this way.

In my current list of models of events, there is only one stands up to Occam's Razor. In it I no longer ascribe any of Jeff's words or actions to any kind of malice nor do I rely on him being motivated by retaliation. I now ascribe his deeds to some combination of a need for high-energy stimulation, overconfidence, inexperience, extreme focus on short-term benefits and either lack of familiarity with alternate personality types such as mine or difficulties identifying and adapting to such personality types. 

In order to remind myself that the person I am talking about is a model I constructed in my head which necessarily differs from the original person, I'm going to use the moniker HJeff, for "Hypothetical Jeff", to refer to the version of him I have no direct experience of..

Here's what I think:
HJeff doesn't want me to leave DRT or Amazon at all.
He doesn't particularly wants me to feel bad.
My feelings are his lowest high priority, but all other things being equal he'd prefer me be happy if possible.
He doesn't actually think my performance had been poor enough to justify termination.
He does not see the System Engineer job description as relevant to the situation.
I interviewed for and voluntarily took a position and I have to perform its duties whether it's a good fit or not.
If I misunderstood what my responsibilities would be, it is incumbent on me to disagree and commit, and HJeff says we're at the commit phase now.
Me having raised objections every month since I started, even before I'd heard of him, also has no bearing on the situation at hand.
He knows best hard it is to staff up the team and how our current staffing level hurts us and customers
I've heard Jeff's side of phone screens in the team room. I know how hard he's trying and how difficult it has been.
If anybody besides me, Sujal and Michael wants to do this job at these wages, they aren't qualified or can find something better elsewhere.
HJeff genuinely believes my performance last year was insufficient for the role. Specifically, HJeff would say:
That in those cases where I made mistakes or delayed resolution, I had all necessary tools, information and support to avoid such mistakes
That those mistakes and delays do not qualify as "reasonable human variation".
HJeff thinks he can wring better performance out of me
HJeff has been (perhaps not consciously) stretching the limits of the performance evaluation system as a necessary and tiny evil to do what's best for everyone, including me.
He thinks that I'm holding out on him and not "giving my all"
He wants me to "be all I can be."
He thinks if he keeps applying as much drill-instructor pressure as he can get away with, I'll eventually 'break' and overcome whatever holds me back.
I think he sees his words and actions as the best way to lead me to my full potential
Whatever bad feelings I have about are necessary pain that accompanies that kind of growth and not relevant to him anyway as I am responsible for my own feelings.
I hope my previously described objections make more sense in light of this, but to continue this catharsis and provide as much clarity as possible, here are my responses:
My feelings do matter. Yes, I am the person with final say on how I feel about a thing, but there are certain culturally accepted ways to feel about certain things and within the bounds of those norms my feelings are not unusual and are not something I should be forced to manage.
I respond best to genuine recognition and lightweight but rigorous structure. Dean (deantabo@) was fantastic in this regard. It was very difficult for me to decide to leave his team. Thankfully he's staying with Amazon. I imagine he'd be happy to talk with anyone who wants another perspective on my peculiarities.
HJeff's overall approach is bad for customers. A critical feature of the Virtuous Cycle is constant improvement of both the products and how we deliver them. HJeff is trying to improve the product by focusing on the people and is neglecting the systems. It is indeed impossible to get around the need for humans to handle exceptions. However, HJeff's approach to improving the product is to improve exception handling rather than reducing exceptions and providing the humans with better tools. I don't just mean in the short term here. HJeff pays lip service to adapting the team for scale but he doesn't seem to take it seriously. HJeff's vision for the team supporting 10,000 enterprise customers is to have something like 100 DRT engineers supporting 1000-5000 TAMs. This just isn't the Amazon way. If we handled regular Customer Service that way our CS costs would be unsustainable. Certainly customers love a delightful customer service experience, but they would rather not have to interact with CS at all. I see HJeff's ideals as violating that customer need to not have to interact with CS. I'm almost certain Dennis and Cheryl would back me up on both my assessment of his approach and its impact.
HJeff's tactics are bad for DRT, Edge, AWS and Amazon and IT society at large. I'm sure as a Senior HR Specialist you are better equipped than I to talk about when military-style management tactics are appropriate and/or effective. Obviously I claim they are neither in this case, but if you know better I would be genuinely curious to learn more on the subject. Assuming my is correct in this case, then the harm to the various scopes of groups shouldn't need explanation or defense. That said, they are even worse for me because, as a friend of mine pointed out, I tend to conform more to what is associated with female gender roles by those who go about making such associations. I tend to favor a quiet, passive, conflict-minimized approach to problems and people. When someone imposes male gender role expectations on me I react negatively and eventually refuse to participate in the exchange. My conflict with Annie Wyn last year is another example of this, as well as a handful of isolated incidents I could think of in my 26 years of working for non-family members, including my paper route when I was a teenager.

I have been giving my all and his tactics are the WORST way to lead me for all the reasons I've talked about: it's insulting to me and eroded trust to the breaking point. I perceive it as macho nonsense which I have no patience for. HJeff wants to make the job exciting ("Conflict! Emergencies! Everything is always automatically overdue and critical to respond to perfectly!") and I want to make it boring ("The system's many fail-safes will handle 99.99% of incidents. Inaction is almost always preferable to action because we engineer the system for self-sufficiency and humans are bad at making snap judgements and acting on them.").

My theory about his drill-instructor pressure may be supported by his approximately weekly military anecdotes in the team room. I'm certain Michael and Sujal would back me up on at least the assertion that he keeps telling stories about people who went into the military thinking they could "win" in some sense and then every last one of them eventually caving in. I always expressed disgust and said things like "they can only get away with that in a context where the participants have signed their lives away", but if he was trying to tell me something by telling the story, I don't think my response was heard, understood and accepted. It certainly wasn't acknowledged.

Obviously I still can't prove anything and it wouldn't change anything if he denied my accusations, but at least this model matches available verifiable data much more closely than any of my others.

General ranting
Relationship functionality is proportional to trust. It is impossible and unhealthy to cooperate with an agent known to be operating against you. Trust is (among other things) the degree of certainty one has that the other agent is generally disposed to cooperate with you. With zero trust (other agent is unpredictable), the relationship can only produce a very small amount and usually the primary focus is
