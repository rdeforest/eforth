# Mongoose

Anyone interested in pair sysops? :)

- One does concrete steps
  - Responding to CR feedback
  - Driving tickets
  - Generating CRs
  - Running scripts

- Other does meta work: research, docs, etc
  - Drive/oversee concrete steps, answer questions
    - "what next?"
    - "does this look right?"

  - Package inventory
    - Changes made, broken into stages

  - Service inventory
    - Dependencies
    - Consumers
    - Deployment stages

  - Automation opportunity discovery

## Current status

  - Four(?) CRs out, some have feedback to deal with
  - Four(?) tickets out needing oversight

## Known dangers

  - NetFlow availability?
  - SNMP ACL?
  - The actual work!
    - Probably 10 hours of what we think of as work left
    - It'll take me at least twice that by myself
    - I think two of us could finish most of it in less than 10 hours
