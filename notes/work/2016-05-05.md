# Mongoose

Anyone interested in pair sysops? :)

- One does concrete steps
  - Responding to CR feedback
  - Driving tickets
  - Generating CRs
  - Running scripts
- Other does meta work: research, docs, etc
  - Drive/oversee concrete steps, answer questions
    - "what next?"
    - "does this look right?"
  - Package inventory
    - Changes made, broken into stages
  - Service inventory
    - Dependencies
    - Consumers
    - Deployment stages
  - Automation opportunity discovery

## Current status

  - Four(?) CRs out, some have feedback to deal with
  - Four(?) tickets out needing oversight

## Known dangers

  - NetFlow availability?
  - SNMP ACL?
  - The actual work!
    - Probably 10 hours of what we think of as work left
    - It'll take me at least twice that by myself
    - I think two of us could finish most of it in less than 10 hours

# Bigger picture

## Rich's concerns:

- Remedy queue
  - Ticket quality measurement: X% of tickets should
    - non-redundant
    - actionable
    - unavoidable
    - represent a real problem (not "high CPU" or "low swap")
  - Drive down resolution time
    - Is this actually a problem?
    - Runbooks?
  - Select N (1?) tickets per week at random for deep dive
    - Root cause follow-up
    - Recurring problem?
    - Duplicate?
    - Going to right team?
    - Known issue? Can/should we pre-tag those?
- Operational Efficiency
  - Autmoation (duh)
    - Dervived configuration
    - Dynamic seed/override configuration
  - Process improvement
    - Process measurements
    - Reduce friction

Both share a common problem: context switching

- Operations vs Engineering
  - Examples of contrasting thought patterns
    - Triage       / Deep Dive
    - Right Now    / In The Future
    - This Time    / Most Times
    - Urgent       / Important
    - Communicate  / Plan
    - Mitigate     / Prevent
    - Restore      / Architect
    - Troubleshoot / Research
    - Escalate     / Collaborate
  - Some orgs deal with this by separating the duties
    - Removes motivation to apply engineering to operations
