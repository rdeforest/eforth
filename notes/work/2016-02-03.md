# Problems to be solved

- Clarifying the (perceived) performance gap
  - Is my performance unknown?
    - SIM and Remedy tickets, wiki history, emails and peer feedback?
  - Is my performance known but unsatisfactory?
    - What were expectations expressed and how did I acknowledge them?
  - Is my performance satisfactory but not for my position?
    - If so, isn't transitioning a no-brainer?

- Ways to demonstrate delivery
  - Identify pending work which might be suitable to a demonstration
    - Arbor upgrade research 
      - How would we do it
      - Cost/risks
      - What would justify it
    - Arbor mitigation cleanup management tool
      - Understand, document and validate config backup and restore
      - Inventory existing mitigations
        - Audit for "important" (non-standard) mitigations
        - Monitor for changes to important rules
      - Create test instance of Arbor
      - Acquire and/or develop, then test library for removing mitigations
      - Validate or create Arbor portal and back-end health monitoring
        - i.e. detect/control impact from automation
      - Start auto clean-up
      - Wrap-up
  - Agree on success criteria
  - Execute
