# Working on DRT team

## The Good

* People
  * Atulya
    * Trustworthy
    * Experienced
  * Dennis
    * Patient, Kind
    * Good instincts (humans limit scaling)
  * Jeff
    * Learning fast

## The Bad

* People
  * Atulya
    * Favoring face-to-face communication
    * "Are you with us or not"
      * How about some concrete expecations instead?
    * He was wrong about Tuesday
  * Jeff
    * Not getting the "humans limit scaling" problem

## The Ugly

* People
  * Atulya
    * He's even working himself too hard


## Other

Atulya is trying to run DRT like a startup. That might be ok for others, but
it's terrible for me.
