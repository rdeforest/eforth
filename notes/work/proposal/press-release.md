# Introducing Lookout 2.0!

## 

#### _DATELINE: Seattle, WA, July 2020_

Amazon's Lookout team launched a web UI and equivalent AWS API which current
and future customers may use to obtain and manage Lookout services.

For "several years"<sup>_[clarify]_</sup> Lookout has offered a metric
summarization service to a select few internal teams. Through this service,
teams could expose multi-dimensional data to Lookout and later query Lookout to
determine what the most common patterns in that data were. Customers generally
used the service to identify malicious or dramatically inefficient activities
which should either be stopped or optimized.

In this way, the service has been of great value in identifying the "low
hanging fruit" of resource consumption, but the system also had many
unfortunate constraints which limited its utility.

Today's launch of Lookout's new external API and UI are merely the customer-visible
tip of the iceberg that is the re-tooling of the entire Lookout Suite.
This re-tooling will delight customers and the Lookout team alike by

- removing humans as a gating factor in most customer-driven changes
  - _which changes?_
- reducing or eliminating system limitations
  - _which limitations?_
- reducing the operating costs of Lookout for customers and Lookout alike
  - _which costs? how much?_
