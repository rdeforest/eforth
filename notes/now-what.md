# Untitled

* Work will never come first in my life
* Atulya seems to be trying to run things like a startup. Bad idea.
  * Seemed to be trying to frame our discussion in terms of me acting in bad faith or something
* Getting a macho vibe
* Don't like the chaos
* Don't like people ignoring my work

# My response to the challenges

## The day Atulya thinks I lacked ownership

I talked to Jeff and he agreed that there had been nothing left for me to do that day.

## The confrontation with Atulya

* "Do you want to do this or not" is not motivational for me.
  * It's lose-lose thinking
    * If my performance improves it's because the confrontation worked
      * Encourages future such encounters
    * If it doesn't improve I'm not meeting the bar
    * If I leave I'm a quitter (I don't mind being a quitter, but it has negative consequences)
  * I hadn't had any doubt about my interest in the work until that day
    * For example, I quit drinking partly to save my job
    * Atulya seemed to think that I either didn't know or didn't care about my performance

# What I think about the team as it stands now

## People

### Robert

* Team switch and two weeks off haven't adequately addressed burn-out

### Atulya

* Avoidance of written word is suspicious

### Jeff

* Overly focused on the here-and-now as opposed to results, system structures and dynamics

### Dennis

* Short-timer syndrome

### Sujal

* Won't know for a while

# What I think the team should be

## Facets

### Research

Examine and model the fundamental trade-offs of DoS prevention and response:

* (infrequent but adversary-controlled) impact due to resource exhaustion vs
* smarter (more expensive) filtering at various levels vs
* more (usually unused) capacity

Figure out costs

* Cost to adversaries to generate various types of attacks
* Cost to Amazon to employ various protections and responses
* Costs to Amazon customers to protect themselves

### Education (internal and external)

* Documentation
* Presentations
* Outreach - This stuff impacts everyone. We should be working together.

### Tools

* Visibility and filtering at various levels (already underway)
* Architecture analysis tool(s)
  * Bottleneck identification
  * Auto-scaling opportunities
* Artificial load generators?
