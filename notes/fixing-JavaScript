The problem is the data inheritance. JavaScript still retains data inheritance
in that if foo[x] doesn't exist and foo.__proto__[x] does, foo.x ===
foo.__proto__.x.

I don't like that. It's necessary because methods and vars are merged.

How I think it should be:

Data model:
    All instance vars are private


function createColdObject(parent) {
  var self = {};

  
...


How it should be

   parent.method = function (args) {
     _.param = args[0]; // or whatever
   }
