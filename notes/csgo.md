# Ideas

## Game changes

- More realistic
  - No mid-air movement without appropriate consequences. What is this, Super
    Mario Brothers?
  - Damage should hurt performance. Someone at 1hp should not shoot as well as
    someone at 100.
  - Per-magazine bullet counts
    - When you re-load, you throw away the rounds still in the magazine
