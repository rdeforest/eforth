# Breaking the cycle?

## Current state

### Thoughts: pothead guru

Everything I am experiencing feels more relevant to me personally than usual.

### Emotions: resigned without defeat

Despite whatever feelings I continue to have in response to past events, my
memories and feelings are no more than unreliable information to be processed
and used to inform current choices.

### Situation: seeking distance

Currently striving to avoid agitating work thoughts until my next meeting with
HR on Monday morning. Explicitly not thinking about work future beyond that.

Focusing on personal projects

  - Motorcycle
  - Programming
  - Music
  - Games
  - Writing
  - Chores
  - Thinking about stuff

Trying to give myself permission to be unproductive.

## "The Cycle"

Abdication of responsibility, a passive victim mindset, then paralyzing fear
as a natural consequence.

  - "Why is this good thing happening to me?"
    - Denying or ignoring my liberties and contributions
  - "When will the other shoe drop?"
    - Denying or ignoring my role in shaping my future.
  - "This bad thing is unjust!"
    - Unjustified sense of entitlement

With each progressive iteration I have accepted more responsibility and
benefited accordingly.

## Next?

  - Distance, detachment, decoupling
    - without losing passion
    - with increasing ownership
  - Capitalizing on the insights

# Unrelated but relevant: the pothead guru stuff

## Cute expressions:

  - Fortune favors the bold
  - If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice - Rush
  - No plan survives contact with the enemy

    - The air's warm

      - never be
    - The wind is soft
      - tonight
      - the tide is low
    - And now I know the way
      - (I never felt better now)

    - And sometimes life
      - it moves too
      - slow
    - Slows to a crawl
      - and all the poetry
      - is lost
    - And without speed
      - hope becomes certainty
    - And for once I'm certain
      - (I never felt better now)

    - A garden is 
      - its own
      - perfect world
    - Where everything has a place
    - And Every leaf
      - every stone, every
      - speck of dirt
    - But where is my place?
      - (I never felt better now)

    - I even tried 
      - to get arrested 
      - today
    - But everyone 
      - looked the other way
    - I count the hours 
      - and I count 
      - the days
    - And for once I'm certain
      - (I never felt better now)

    - Don't waaaant 
      - your help
    - Don't .. need
      - your help

    - Help 
      - less

    - The water's clean
      - I see that it's
      - full of dimes
    - For every wish
      - I wonder why
    - Why all I want
      - is something
      - beautiful
    - A place to rest
      - (I never felt better now)

    - (whistling)

    - (Chorus)

    - By the way, 
    - hate to say, 
    - help me please someone

    - Help
      - less
