# next appointment

  - Reasons for scheduling an appointment sooner than next week
    - Fear of Lithium
      - I try to live my life in a safe-by-default fashion and this plan as I
        know it does not meet that description.
      - Also the combination of lithium and needles triggers my phobias

  - Concerns about mind-altering substances
    - The past
      - Avoided alcohol, psychiatric medications
      - Was convinced to drink more than a little alcohol by someone who
        manipulated me (Daniel)
      - Convinced to take psychiatric medication by people who earned my trust
      - There were benefits to some of each
        - Alcohol turned out to be self-medication
        - Benefits of Vyvanse almost almost completely certain
      - Some fears came true
        - I didn't notice I was drinking too much, ignored feedback from others
        - Medication a factor in regretted behaviors of mine
    - Now
      - I haven't touched alcohol since July 17th
      - Partly recovered from January tail spin but not back on course yet
    - Want to re-baseline
      - I believe I was better off in 2014 than I am now.
        - Is this actually true? What do my graphs say?
      - To the degree that doing so is safe, I'd like to re-establish a safe
        holding pattern
        - I need to know how to safely stop all my medication in the event of
          a disaster of some sort (just knowing how should be enough)
        - I'd like to cease experimenting until I'm confident I can't get any
          better without experimenting
    - More information
      - My questions
        - ...
      - Subjects
        - Bi-polar, anxiety, depression, ...
        - Medications
      - Better (preferably still online) resources than Wikipedia, NIH
        - I'm not sure what 'better' means in this case
      - Recommended search terms?
      - Is it possible/likely that bi-polar symptoms could be triggered by
        stress and medication in a person who isn't naturally bi-polar?

  - Next steps
    - Starting next week I have six weeks
    - Does the exposure technique apply in this case?
    - How hard _should_ I plan?
    - How frequently should we meet?

# Old notes

Dr. Lemberg

  - When I don't know what to do
    - What is the question? What would it mean for this to not be a problem,
      etc.
    - "Should we talk about this more or should I talk to someone else?"
    - Seek consensus
    - (nothing new here)

3 tablets a day
300 in the morning
600 at night
morning dose 12 hours after evening dose
five days later, draw blood to measure level
if adjustment needed, five more days to confirm

  reduce lamigdol by half until next appointment
