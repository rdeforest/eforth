#### Background

*Tragic youth*

- 1984-1992: bored and surrounded by computers; taught myself and Pascal, C; wrote a handful of trivial toy programs like Conway's Game of Life; experimented with more esoteric languages like Forth and Prologue
- 1993: Programmer extending PeachTree Complete Accounting for DOS, which was written in compiled MS Basic.
- 1994: McDonald's crew
- 1995: Odd jobs, then five months of Windows 95 tech support starting with two weeks of training before launch

*Increasingly relevant experience*

- 1996-2001: Unix and Windows ops at an ISP, a bank and a startup (three different companies); almost exclusively in-house and FOSS software; Some scripting
- 2002-2010: incident management (like TOS), data center ops and app ops at Disney; Apps were Java on in-house servlet engines and later Tomcat, all on Windows.
- 2010-2012: App ops at scharp.org; some scripting in shell, Perl and a proprietary language embedded in the app I operated
- 2012-2015: Payments SysOps, which I don't need to describe to you :)
- 2015-2016: Edge Systems/DDoS Response Team; a waste of what could have been 10 of my best months
- 2016-2017: Edge Systems/Lookout; standard Amazon ops plus a few months of standard Amazon programming

### Q & A

This section is cheesy; have a strong drink and/or something to vom into nearby.

#### The usual questions

_"What do you want out of your work?"_
To use my technical skills on projects which are as abstract as possible while
still providing customers with new measurable value ever 1 to 4 weeks.
Obviously Builder Tools Next fits in pretty well with this, so lest you think
this is something new about me, ask brucfelt@ how frustrated he was with me in
Payment SysOps because of my gravitation towards the abstract.

_"What specific kinds of work are you interested in?"_
Design > development > ops > project management. I know every SE, SysDE, SDE,
etc. above L4 has to do a little of each of these no matter what our team or
focus is, so I expressed them as a ranking to be optimized for rather than as
absolute preferences.

_"When I say 'pager', do you flinch?"_
Nope. I don't mind being in an on-call rotation. I've been in some kind of
on-call rotation for 10 years. I survived a week when I received 400 pages in
two days (monitoring edge case which will be obsolete "soon"). I volunteered
to take six weeks in a row of work-hours-only on call while my team finished
delivering AWS Sheild. With healthy support from leadership, ops pain is just
a symptom of a opportunities to invent and simplify or think big.  I was also
on long calls during my payments days.

#### Making Great Hiring Decisions / "Tell me about a time when..."

_Customer Obsession_

At the ISP I worked at in Santa Cruz I was secondary phone support for
customers. When I couldn't solve customers' problems over the phone (almost
always due to communication challenges), I offered to come to their home or
business to help them correct the issue, and dozens took me up on the offer.

At the startup I was asked to report on the number of people were signed up
for email about job opportunities matching their interests. I provided the
numbers both with and without the bouncing email addresses. I thought it would
be bad for our relationships with current and future customers to advertise 1
million people being interested in our service when more than half of those
"people" were clearly not engaged with our site. I left it up to management
and marketing to decide how honest to be, and in retrospect I wish I had
pushed my point more effectively.

_Ownership_
While in payments, a four-letter bank which shall not be named had three
distinct issues on their end which Beach and Seals could not compensate for
and which were impacting customers by delaying their money from sales. I
voluntarily took on the task of organizing and driving the resolution of these
three issues. I acted...

_Deliver Results_
During my PIP, I deployed Lookout's stack in BOM while simultaneously adding
our services to Blueprints and automating our credential setup process. It
took me four weeks with help from my team in the fourth week. I then deployed
CMH, LHR and YUL simultaneously in four weeks with help from my team in the
fourth week. For reference, two of my teammates deployed ICN in two weeks.

_Disagree and Commit_
When I realized that my manager at the time (jefflyon@) was writing a PIP for
me, I went to my director (andrewlt@) to object and offered him the options of
giving me two weeks to find a new team, him spending two weeks to find me a
new team, or me spending two weeks looking for a new company. He asked me to
talk to HR about my conflict with my manager and they negotiated some time off
for me to work through my end of the problem with my psyciatrist. When I
returned from my leave my director had placed one of his best people from his
past in charge of Lookout and he asked me to go through my PIP on that team
because nullifying the PIP was out of his pay grade and he didn't think we
could sell our VP on the idea. I disagreed with the assertions of my 2015
review and the justifications for the PIP on both factual and judgement
grounds, but committed to following through with the PIP on the Lookout team.
Then I crushed it (Rich said so).
