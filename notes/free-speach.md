# Words vs Actions

Thoughts motivated by https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/tech-companies-are-cracking-down-on-hate-speech/

## Definitions

* Action is something an entity performs which has measurable consequences.
* Speech is the publication of information

## Thoughts

Speech is a subset of Action in that it is not possible to publish
information without having at least the consequence that the information can
be observed.

We have a tradition of permitting speech to limit the power of entities which
would benefit disproportionately from suppression of communications about
them.

The most abstract justification for this approach is the "informed" portion of
"informed consent": if parties are prevented from relaying information then
the would-be recipients may be making uninformed choices to the detriment of
all.

One problem is that not all speech is published in good faith, and that not
everyone agrees on what is "true".

Another is that some true information is not relevant to the decision-making
processes of the public or even of individuals to which it is sent (privacy
breeches).
