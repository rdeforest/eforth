## Memories

  - Robert, "You Got It" by Roy Orbison, needs practice
  - Raine, and Robert are making progress on "Intervention" by Arcade Fire
  - Phil, crushed "The Rainbow Connection"
  - Robert botched "Jump" by Van Halen and ended it early
  - Raine tried to do "Cornflake Girl"
    - had some understandable snags, but moved through them
    - also had some awesome measures!
  - Phil did a pretty sweet rendition of Landslide by ... uh ... that one band
    - Excellent tone, pitch and timing
    - Timing at the end broke him :)
  - Robert, Panama, Van Halen
  - several songs I didn't get notes on, plus
  - Robert
    - Moody Blues
      - Knights in White Satin
      - Tuesday Afternoon
    - Just a Giggalo
  - Phil, Soldier of Love, Sade
    - NICE. Expressive
