Systems for getting both our needs met

  - Talk about it with her
  - Works by default like keys in basket
  - What are my needs?
    - I want Raine's input, if not full involvement, in my projects

And now, the collaboration!

# Proposal

  - Simple clock: Raine time, Robert time
    - If there's stuff I want to do that we're not doing during Raine time
      - Those are Robert's needs!

  - Exception handling
    - Boundary crossing generally results in stollen hours

  - Robert needs a 'bwains' queue for things Robert wants to do while Raine is at diminished capacity
    - Example - dumb or non-demanding movies
      - Happy Gilmore
      - PeeWee's big adventure
      - Amadeus
      - Fifth Element
      - Caddyshack

## notes

  - Raine points out she'll need to be assertive about enforcing Raine time
  - We need to handle Robert's work time exceptions

# Goals

  - For Raine
    - guarenteed quality time
      - a priority, promise that isn't broken
  - For Robert
    - 

# Topic to review

  - Raine identifies the overlap between my work and social time as a trust issue for her.

...

  - Ability to do things for their own sake without insecurity...
