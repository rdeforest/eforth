09:42]  stormagnet so: last night, WTF 
[09:50]  stormagnet I thought things were going well, we were making progress, and then THAT?  
[09:50]  just.... why?  
[10:56]  guitar.robot First, sorry for the slow response, was interviewing the candidate I mentioned. Second, from my perspective I didn't know anything was wrong until you got home. I told you I needed to go home to get to sleep early to prepare for the interview today. You didn't seem to want to leave so I asked you if you were ok closing out without me and I thought you said you were. When you got home I was confused as to why you were yelling at me. You said something about being followed which I didn't understand because I was still waking up. Then we had some kind of exchange I didn't understand, then I got depressed and went back to sleep. Then T came over and on the way out you told me I had somehow supported the person following you.  
[10:57]  Should I still reschedule the counseling or should I cancel it and research the divorce process?  
[10:57]  stormagnet reschedule 
[10:57]  guitar.robot will do 
[10:58]  I'll head up there as soon as I submit my candidate review 
[10:58]  stormagnet I was freaked out when I got home because a guy tried to follow me home from the bar 
[10:59]  and when I started telling you about it you told me I was wrong and that hadn't happened 
[10:59]  that... was a bit much for me 
[10:59]  guitar.robot I don't remember saying any such thing 
[10:59]  stormagnet I mean, the guy was shouting shit at me the whole way 
[11:00]  guitar.robot that is terrifying 
[11:00]  stormagnet upon sobering up, I hoped that was sleep talking again 
[11:00]  but yeah, it was fucking terrifying 
[11:01]  and that was not the response I needed in that moment
