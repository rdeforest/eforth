Hanging out at Allegro in the U-District while Raine takes the JLPT 1. At
14:00 I'll go downstairs to grab a mocha for her and then meet her for her
break.

I forgot to take my meds this morning and now I'm feeling it pretty bad.
Naturally I have the low energy from not taking Vyvanse but I also find myself
feeling more down than I'm used to. Part of it is situational since I've been
walking around for an hour noticing how everything has changed and remembering
how I felt way back when, but I have to assume some of it is from my other
meds wearing off.

Also I'm having a hard time thinking technically.
