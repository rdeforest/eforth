# What happened

Raine says last night before bed I promised her I'd stay home and spend the
day with her. This morning I had no recollection of that but stayed home
anyway just because. Later when I said I was going to go hang out with Bruce
she got angry.

When I told her I wasn't going to hang out with Bruce after all she got
angrier and told me to "just go". Now I'm staying home but we're not talking
to each other and I don't know if she cares if I'm home or not.

# Thoughts

- I'm staying at home because that is the least harmful thing I can do
- I thought things were getting better
  - I thought supporting her through her JLPT was helpful
  - I thought the more time I was spending with her was helping
  - I thought the new TV and upcoming plans were signs of improvement
- I am surprisingly stubborn
  - I have a hard time remembering how stubborn I am

# Feelings

- I don't want to be away from Raine for more than a day without good reason
- I believe how she expresses herself impedes my progress
- Things have only ever gotten worse since July 2015.
  - Not drinking didn't help.
  - Resuming drinking didn't help and may have accelerated the decline.

# Assumptions

- She thinks me staying home now doesn't count
  - She doesn't want to spend time with me now
- Nothing I say or do can help
  - No help of any kind is available
- She doesn't think I want to be reliable

# Raine's feedback

- She tries to come up with things we can do together
  - they're not enough
  - I get tired of them
  - not interesting to me

- She tries to dress herself and our home to attract me
  - The TV was an attempt to entice me to stay home
  - Nothing she does is enough
  - There's always somewhere I'd rather be and people I'd rather be with
  - She's not even in the top three of my preferred investments at any given time

- I only spend time with her to placate her
  - She feels when I'm with her it's under duress

- I talk about her with other people but that's not great

- My unreliability re-enforces her assertions

- She delays enjoying things so she can share them with me
  - She's not doing the things she likes because she's waiting for me
  - There's nobody else for her to do things with

- New friends aren't an option
  - She spends a lot of time alone and not feeling good

- She acknowledges the pressure this puts on me
  - to make time and adapt to our mutual limitations

- She was particularly set off by
  - "Tuesday isn't one of your days"

- She says my behavior changed around the winter of 2014-2015

- We spent more time together when she was in school

# My responses

- I shouldn't speak verbally
  - I try to respond to something and end up creating a new thing
