Raine is worried about me.  She is concerned by what she interprets as
symptoms of hypomania. After looking into it further I think she is mistaken.

## Symptoms, descriptions and my excuses

_All info from Wikipedia._

### Pressured Speech

> A tendency to speak rapidly and frenziedly, as if motivated by an urgency

> pressured speech, is difficult to interrupt. It may be too fast, or too
> tangential for the listener to understand. It is an example of cluttered

I agree that I have demonstrated this more since starting therapy than before,
but I did have it to a lesser degree as well. Further down the Wikipedia
article it says:

> People with schizophrenia, as well as anyone experiencing extreme anxiety,
> may also exhibit pressure of speech.

And the next paragraph states:

> Pressure of speech has commonly been observed in people with attention
> deficit hyperactivity disorder.

For my part, when I speak this way it is from fear and frustration. The
urgency partly comes from having had the experience throughout my life of
having someone misunderstand me because I didn't finish the thought before
they started responding. I also sometimes feel I need to express a thought
before I forget it.

In situations with Raine in which I have had this "pressured speech" I think
it has been a symptom of my defensiveness and anxiety. The more flustered I am
the worse I am at speaking smoothly and that increases the stress further.

### Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity

The degree to which I have expressed "inflated" self-esteem is the degree to
which my self-image has become more realistic. My self-esteem has improved but
it's still only positive intermittently.

The "view of oneself as better than others" sounds like the opposite of me,
but I can see parallels between my feeling of being unable to communicate with
most people and the second half of the description above. I do not see this as
a positive attribute and in fact it is one of the reasons I went into therapy
again.

Furthermore, this feeling of isolation has been present all my life and has
decreased during my current therapy.

### Decreased need for sleep

I have been sleeping less, but not because I don't feel tired or don't want to
sleep. My sleep challenges are almost entirely environmental.

There are many reasons my sleep has been disturbed and there have been
multiple whole weeks in which I have slept well. Today specifically I got up
at 5am because the cat woke me up, but since I went to sleep around 9pm,
that's eight hours of sleep which is healthy and normal. I've also always been
a morning person.

On top of that, I recently had an on-call week which got me back in that mode
of never knowing when I was going to have to wake up and be alert. This has
nothing to do with medication and was a problem at Disney too. For the
foreseeable future, I will have externally disrupted sleep one out of every
seven weeks.

### Flight of ideas, racing thoughts

> Flight of ideas describes excessive speech at a rapid rate that involves

> puns or rhymes.

I do not believe this is a symptom I have demonstrated.

Subjectively, I have had experiences like this in circumstances of unusually
high stress. I do not think they qualify as symptomatic. They are also not
something that is new within the last four years and I believe they have
decreased during therapy, if anything.

### Easily distracted and attention-deficit

Again, not something new, and sometimes improved in the last three years.

### Increase in psychomotor agitation

> Psychomotor agitation is a set of signs and symptoms that stem from mental

This is indeed something I do regularly and more so now than before working at
Amazon. My medications, especially Vyvanse, are probably exacerbating this,
but I do not think it is the cause. It is also yet another symptom which is
not new. I do have anxiety and we know why.

### Involvement in pleasurable high-risk activities

I cannot think of a single time in my life when I demonstrated this symptom.

## Overall thoughts

- What Raine calls 'mania', most people would call 'normal'.

- Those parts which most would not call normal are obviously the result of
  passive stresses.

- Therapy gave me some headroom which I then unwittingly sacrificed to work
  instead of using it to pursue my own improvement.

- Raine is looking for the things which frighten her most and is finding them
  in me.

## Conclusions

> The conclusion is where you arrive when you stop thinking.

- I'm not going to get any better. I've shown some improvement but apparently
  it does not justify the side-effects and risks.

- I had been happy but now it seems that was bad, so I prefer to go back to
  what had been "working" for 39 years.

- I am open to suggestions but I don't think Raine and I can salvage our
  relationship.

    - When I try to explore solutions ("what can we do to increase your
      safety") she reacts negatively. Actions speak louder than words, and my
      actions have been supportive for the seven years before and eight years
      since her symptoms showed up.


Raine talks me into seeking therapy and then worries that my therapy is making
me worse. I actually believe both drinking and therapy have been good for me,
but I'm getting the feeling I can never satisfy Raine. She seems to think I'm
going to follow in the footsteps of other men she has been close to (father,
brothers)
