# Introduction

We're in the second decade of the 21st century and humans are still
hand-editing XML. This has to stop.

# Schemas, templates, data and transformations

This project can 

- interpret XML in light of optional schemas
- serialize objects into XML based on some optional schemas
- Help define and interact with the schemas themselves
