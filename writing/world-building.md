I'm thinking about making my own world, which I need to do for CORVID anyway.

# Setting

- Start with Tolien/Forgotten Realms/Eberron
- ...

# System

- DnD Race replaced with something more fluid but still genetic
- DnD Class morphs into a kind of template system used to describe experience
- Levels eliminated in favor of more granular progress, and sometimes regress
 - Exercising a bunch? Gain some related traits and skills
 - Studying a lot? Gain some related traits (endurance maybe), knowledge and skills
 - Slacking off? Lose some traits and possibly knowledge and experience
- Would be nice to replace magic with science without going futuristic
 - Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court?
 - The Buggane universe Raine and I came up with?
