# Brunch

"There he is. Kevin! Over here! This is my friend Michele. Michele,
Kevin. Kevin, Michele."

Kevin waves and smiles to Michele. "Nice to meet you."

"Likewise."

"I told her about our cookie email thread. She thinks she can set
something up that might be the closest you'll ever get to buying a
girl scout."

Kevin looks skeptical. Michele smiles and says, "Within the bounds
of the law and safe, sane and consentual relations of course. I am
an amature fantasy arranger. I find people who have fantasies which
mirror each other, coach the in role-play and then set up a way for
them to meet in a context which supports them role-playing their
fantasies."
