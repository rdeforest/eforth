Credit to Tamara for giving me the idea by telling me about a review of the
DSM-V as though it were a dystopian sci-fi story told from the POV of a
standard.

My take on this is that I want to ACTUALLY write a story this way. I want to
write an collection of policy manuals for a company in a world that doesn't
exist. The world and stories in it are revealed through the manuals. The
structure of the manuals will differ to reflect the nature of the groups which
prepared them. Ancillary materials in the references could cite material
outside the manuals to hint at things.
