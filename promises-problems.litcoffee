# Problems with Promises

How does one say "whenever this is done, do this other thing"? In other words,
like a with (resource) block or something.

I guess this isn't really a problem with Promise, but rather with ECMAScript.

We can still do it explicitly with callbacks and Promises, but there's no
guarentee that the Promise will either resolve OR reject. It's not that kind
of promise. :)
