## Opportunities

Improve recurring tasks in some way

  - Tasks
    - self
      - existence: breathe, sleep, drink, eat
        - automatic but improvable
      - therapy/recovery/health/...
        - medication
        - therapy homework
      - maintenance
        - bathing
        - clothing
        - poopin?
        - brushing, flossing
      - improvement
        - exercise
          - aikido?
          - climbing?
        - journaling
        - practice
          - guitar
        - research
        - projects
          - music
          - programming
      - entertainment
        - RSS feeds
        - computer games
        - tabletop games
    - marriage
    - friends
    - work
    - family
  - Improvements
    - Executed more consistently (or at all in some cases)
      - That thing HabitRPG used to almost do for me
    - Resources (external, internal) devoted to said tasks reduced
      - Maybe find ways to make the tasks more efficient to execute?
    - Measured, monitored, alerting on threshold breech
      - The hardest but also most valuable improvement
    - Combine tasks with each other and with meta work
      - Add to journal at time of taking meds?
