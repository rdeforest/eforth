## Opportunities

Improve recurring tasks in some way

        - tabletop games
    - marriage
    - friends
    - work
    - family
  - Improvements
    - Executed more consistently (or at all in some cases)
      - That thing HabitRPG used to almost do for me
    - Resources (external, internal) devoted to said tasks reduced
      - Maybe find ways to make the tasks more efficient to execute?
    - Measured, monitored, alerting on threshold breech
      - The hardest but also most valuable improvement

# Minimum Viable Product ideas

## HabitRPG knock-off

  - Arbitrary scheduling
  - "next up" querying
  - day planning w/ optional automation
  - mobile interface
