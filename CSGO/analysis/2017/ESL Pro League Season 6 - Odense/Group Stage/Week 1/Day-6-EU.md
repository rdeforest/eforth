# New overtime rule

Regular games are worth three points, overtime games are worth 2 for the
winner and 1 for the loser.

# Game 1 - G2 v Mousesports on Cobble

## TL;DR: G2 stomped Mouse

G2 look strong, obviously. Good aim, smart play, 

## Second half:

- Round 2
 - Mayhem
 - bomb plant at A
 - no kit
 - STYKO smokes the bomb
 - hops up behind the hut
 - spots shox
 - headshots him and defuses in time
- Round 3
 - Full B push
 - Quick trades and then G2 eliminates the rest of Mouse handily
 - (I miss the old Mouse's full-eco domination)

 - Headshot to STYKO
 - chrisJ recovers the nova
  - pushes through smoke into B long
  - dies on the other side of the smoke
 - G2 clean up the leftovers taking us to match point
- Round 8: 15/7 G2
 - Mouse on deagles, utility and body armor
 - Mouse puts up a fight and gets it to 2 v 1 favoring G2
 - But again NBK takes down ropz

## Post-game commentary

The game upset Chad and I agree. Mouse looked to be 30ms behind very time and
showed poor teamwork. There were too many unnecessary 1 v 1 fights. Mouse
looked desperate. Here's hoping for a more interesting game on Cache.

Also, I'm ready for Cobble to rotate out of the map pool.

# Game 2 - Mousesports v G2 on Cache

## Pre-game

- Chad is pessimistic based on his assertion that Cache favors shox and kennyS.
- Yanko says Mouse need to
 - be more aware of their options
 - prevent close-range fights
- Chad says Mouse beat Faze on Cache earlier in the week
 - and FaZe beat G2?
 - So by the transitive property...

And of course, NBK has a part of the map named after him (around the corner
from squeaky door at A site).

- Both teams demonstrating hubris, insufficient teamwork
- Lots of dumb mistakes, barrels poking out, etc
- Lots of corners not checked
- suNny didn't notice NBK crawling through A site
 - NBK didn't notice suNny behind him until he was well out of the site.
 - NBK failed to exploit discovering the mistake first
