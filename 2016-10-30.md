# Today's plan

- Attempt a version of Pomodoro Method time-boxing
- Identify, define and prioritize aspects of life needing attention

## About the method

### 30 minute cycles

- set timer for 25 minutes
- describe the goal
- attack the goal
- at alarm
 - note results
 - take break (no timer but aim for 5 mins)

### The log

- This file for now
- Level 2 heading for each cycle
 - start time
 - goal
 - result
 - git commit

# Aspects

Level 2 heading for each re-start

## Second try

See ./ontology.md

## Abandoned start

Top level based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs

- Pysiological
 - Maintenance
 - Development
 - ...
- Safety/security
 - Physical

- Social
- Esteem
- Actualization

# Log

In reverse chronological order so I can just insert at the top.

## 14:30 - Add priority levels to aspects

Goals:
 - Move current tree into its own file
 - Add relative priority information for nodes

Results:
 - Ontology is now 88 lines
  - Added Concepts/Life cycle, among other things
 - Created bracket syntax for priorities
 - Added priority information for 15 nodes
  - Many others inhert

Misses:
 - Went off-scope adding life-cycle info
  - But it will be part of a re-factor which is good
 - Need a way to derive priorities
 - End-summarization taking up a whole 5 minutes, will have to account for
   that in the method.

## 13:55 - Life Aspect Inventory

Goals:
 - Re-create tree of aspects of life
 - Describe branches and leaves
  - Relative priority level?
  - Approximate effort?

Results: 72 lines of organization, feeling good
