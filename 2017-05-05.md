# Problems

- having a hard time getting myself to do stuff
  - call EAP
  - sell stock
  - file change of address (but I don't have a mailbox key yet anyway)
  - etc

- extremely difficult to be productive
  - but work understands

- money, maybe

# Not problems

- I'm sad but not depressed

# Next step

If at work and not able to focus record why, what's happening, my feelings, deep dive.

Maybe set aside some time for venting?

Look for a mindfulness app.
