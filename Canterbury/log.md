# 2017-12-03 - Offer of assistance and discussion w/ Katy

Around 14:00 (give or take an hour?) I mentioned that I could fix their wi-fi
or whatever. Katy and I discussed it, she showed me their "network closet"
(heh), I explained what I had in mind and she seemed super hype. She gave me
Kristen and Mariah's names as the managers on duty on Wednesday.
