- Better signal?
- Features?

## Other

- Clean, tidy, etc
 - tidy up cables
 - secure more devices

- Manage risks
 - backups (maybe already fine)
 - physical security
  - Do you really want your computer unlocked in an unlocked room?
  - Staff could mess with stuff?

- Manageability
 - May not be a problem

- Performance
 - May not be a problem
 - Route to 8.8.8.8
  - 10 hops
  - 13 to 100 ms latency
  - no packet loss

# Config

- Canterbury wifi

# Questions

- Where is the "Canterbury" hotspot?
- What is the Comcast password and Netgear admin access
 - Only if necessary to fix schedule problem

- Why two cable routers?
- What's going on with the server?
 - Is it getting patched?
 - Why is the screen resolution so low?
 - Who 'owns' this stuff in the Amazon sense?

- I'm curious about the USRobotics Courier, thought it's not my business
