# Readline enhanced

## Usage


    readline = require 'rl-enhanced'
    
    rl = readline.enhance

rl is an instance of a child of the node Interface class, extended with

      options:
        offerBlockMode: true
        blockModeToggleKey: 'C-v'

User can toggle 'block mode' with ctrl-v. Same as Node repl.

      prompt:
        format: '> '
        formatExprPatterns: {}

          twoCharPattern '\\', backslashOps
          twoCharPattern '%' , percentOps

          twoCharPattern = (prefix, ops) ->
            formatExprPatterns[prefix + '(.)'] =
              (matched, char) ->
                if char is prefix
                  char
                else if fn = ops[char]
                  (fn.bind @) char
                else
                  matched

        formatter: ->
          idx = 0

          while idx < promptFormat.length
            for promptFormatter
            if matched = promptFormat[idx..].match

promptFormatter is called when the interface emits an 'update prompt' event. If it returns a string, that's the new prompt.

      lineParser: (line) ->
        ['help']

The line parser is called with a line of text. It should return an array of strings. The first is the command, the rest are arguments.

      commands:
        help: (topic) ->
