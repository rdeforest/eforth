# Another stab at a light but powerful Meta Object Protocol

This is meant to be the beginning of a series of meta-programming modules.

## Deliverables

- create and modify model schemas programatically (like StrongLoop, but better).
- persist such changes
- persist changes to instances
- should understand inter-object relationships
 - delegation
 - containment
 - etc

## Thoughts

- May want to use Backbone or something to handle the obvious stuff?
