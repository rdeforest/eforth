# Relationship to CORVID

This area is for tinkering without feeling like I have to deal with everything

# Aspects

- Namespaces

- Object model
 - How object methods interact with 
 - State
 - Message handling
  - Handler matching takes message details (types?) into account?
 - Inheritance
 - Class vs Instance
  - A class's contract is about how it constructs and manages its instances
  - A child of a class
   - defaults to its parent's contracts
   - defines a special case of its parent
  - An instance of a class
   - conforms to its constructor's contracts vis-a-vis instances
  - Does this distinction matter?
 - Message passing
  - message/event

- Logged reality
 - Persistence

- Text <-> message/event
