flag at half               mast as               frames click       fast: Not a
thing will                 last as               past is            past, It's like
stacks of                  thoughts that got     played and         worn, Used
over and                   over till they were   tired and          torn,

                                                                            I Like a
broken                     clock that            can't tell         time, I Like a
thick ass                  book that's           filled with wack   rhymes, it's Like a
scorching                  blaze that            burned the         sand, I Like a
band that                  planned and           planned and        planned

                                                                            And flew
down like a                raven in the          dark of            night, And snatched
up the                     worm                  helpless to        fight, brought it
back to the                nest singing          microphone         check One

sand in                    one hand You          can't hold for     long, Like
scheming on a              plan that             goes all           wrong, It's like
fudge and                  caramel they're       not the            same, And
it's a                     shame all you         talk is            game,

                                                                            You

what do I                  want? What            do I               need?
Why do I                   wonder what's         in it for          me? It's the
