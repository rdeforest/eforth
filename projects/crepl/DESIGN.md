# Thinking ahead is for the weak!!!!

Implement a minimal DSL for doing the kinds of things one normally does, but
better:

- basic stuff
  - create a function
  - change a function's def
  - enhance a function
  - class versions of above
- More shell-like
  - mass changes
- Safety and stuff
  - revision control
