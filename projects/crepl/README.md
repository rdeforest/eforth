# the point

Reduce redundancy. For example, there's no reason to shorten
Object.getOwnPropertyNames again.

More importantly, when I make a comfortable way to manipulate classes in
general or a specific class in particular, I shouldn't have to do that again.

Automatic improvement via noodling.

# How?

## Persistence

- Re-writing a method should be persisted immediately

## Versioning

- It should be trivial to revert bad changes

## Minimal friction

- The default things should happen automatically

## Shared with others

- Networking, replication, all that
