Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Is anybody familiar with innerspace/txSpace?  It looks kind of
interesting.  Is there one running, anywhere?

I came across a posting on moo-cows about a security problem found
with WAIFs.  Somebody replied that the patch was updated to prevent
the problem, but there was no clear answer from the original poster.
Are WAIFs pretty safe to install?

If we're talking about the concern that waif.wizard could be set to 1, I never really believed it was a security problem because a waif can't be caller_perms().  But waif.wizard has been hardwired to 0 since that patch a lonnng time ago.

FYI, the best place to get WAIFs is from the sf.net CVS.  It's a branch.
