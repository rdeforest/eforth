Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Subject:  impending OS upgrade/doom

Just as a heads up:

I see that Debian 3.1 'sarge' was (finally) officially released the other day, and since I've been rather badly wanting to upgrade for a while, I will probably be getting to this Real Soon Now.

Since I essentially have a stock 'woody' system with no random packages from testing/unstable, there seems to be a high degree of confidence that the Installation Thingie will Just Work, meaning all you folks will see is a reboot and maybe some downtime on the order of an hour and that will be that.  In particular, the lambdamoo server, not being installed as a package should really be unaffected by this.  

But I've been wrong about such things before, so...
