Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Hm.  When I do a ;verb_info(me,999) I get E_VERBNF, not E_INVARG.  So I think the code's correct as is.

Thanks for finding this.  In your suggested replacement code, using verbs() and a for loop is a good idea, except that verbs() will fail on an object the caller can't read... although it could be moved to be before the set_task_perms() line.

I think the simplest fix would be to change ANY on line 6 to E_PERM, E_VERBNF.  That way, if verb_info() raises anything else (it can raise E_TYPE or E_INVARG), execution terminates.

I think you misunderstood what I was referring to.
Yes, if the argument given as the verbname is malformed, verb_info() raises E_VERBNF
But that's not the issue in question here...
The problem lies in giving verb_info() an invalid object argument upon which to look for the verb
If $object_utils:accessible_verbs() is called with an invalid object, the verb_info() in the while statement of line 6 will raise E_INVARG, which will always be != E_VERBNF, so the while() will go on ad infinitem until the task runs out of ticks.

Ah, indeed I misread the statement of the problem.  I've used Diopter's suggested change of changing the ANY to E_PERM, E_VERBNF.  Let me know of any problems.
