Robert, as you know we will have Share Point officially available Aug 1st. This implementation will be fully supported and with the 100% Microsoft Office Integration, this will greatly improve work group and team Process and Document management. We will also be using Share Point as the Process, Procedure and Document automation platform. One of the first processes we will automate will be the entire New Hire Process. 

 

I too have to say that your support and dedication to the betterment of DIG is great.

 

Thanks,

 Japan stokes China sea dispute
Japan's government has awarded a Japanese oil company test drilling rights in
a potential flashpoint maritime area also claimed by China.

Teikoku Oil Co asked for the rights in April, after Tokyo signalled a change
in policy to allow test drilling.

China and Japan have held talks about how to share out resources in the East
China Sea, but have failed to agree.

China said the Japanese move would harm bilateral ties, already strained by
rows over history and resources.

"If Japan persists in granting drilling rights to companies in disputed
waters it will cause a serious infringement of China's sovereign right,"
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters in Beijing.

China has been drilling since 2003 within the area both sides agree are in
Chinese waters, but Japan is concerned that it may be drawing gas from the
area is considers to be its zone.

Japan has held off drilling while the two sides have been trying to resolve
the issue through talks, but these have made no progress.




At the last round of talks on the issue, Beijing suggested Japan and China
engage in joint exploration of the area, but Tokyo turned down that offer.

Teikoku will not be able to begin drilling immediately.

"There are many issues regarding the water area such as safety so we want to
make a decision on when actual work will take place after consulting with the
government agencies concerned," the company said in a statement.

Relations between Japan and China have been deteriorating for months.

Mr Liu also complained on Thursday about a controversial history textbook,
which China says glosses over Japanese abuses during World War II.

Chinese anger at the textbook, which was adopted by a Japanese school board
on Wednesday, led to violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in several cities
across China in April.

Speaking of which...

 Japan textbook back in spotlight
By Chris Hogg
BBC News, Tokyo

A new edition of a Japanese history textbook that has provoked protests in
China and South Korea has been adopted by a public school board in Japan.

Seven junior high schools in the central town of Otawara will use the book,
which has been criticised for distorting Japan's militarist past.

It is the first town to adopt the new edition of the textbook.

The move could re-ignite a diplomatic dispute which first flared when the
government approved the book in April.

This textbook is a new edition of a work that been used for the last four
years in a handful of schools around the country.

It has been criticised for making just a passing mention of atrocities by
Japanese troops in Asia, and leaving out the stories of the women sexually
enslaved by members of the imperial army.


TEXTBOOK ROW
Textbooks approved every 4 years by education ministry
Most controversial history book said to whitewash Nanjing massacre
Earlier edition approved in 2001, but adopted by only 0.1% of schools -
mostly for those with disabilities
School boards must decide which textbook to use by 31 August
Supporters of most controversial book want 10% of boards to approve it

When the government approved it in April, there were diplomatic protests by
China and South Korea. These were followed by anti-Japanese street
demonstrations.

Japan responded that the text did not represent the government's official
view.

The scholars who wrote the book say Japan is too masochistic in its teaching
of history. A decision by the Otawara school board is a victory for them.

The earlier edition of their work was only used on the margins of the school
system.
Now, more than 1,600 students in the public school system will learn from the
new edition.

Almost 600 other communities across Japan will decide whether to use the
controversial text over the next few weeks.

[ Ummm.... yeah. I think I would shy away from teaching RETARDED
GRADESCHOOLERS about that, too. ]

stormagnet says, "Thanks to that Kenzaburo Oe book, I know that the Japanese Department of Education has had a general policy for DECADES now against teaching the severely developmentally disabled about the more fucked up aspects of history/society, since they lack the cognitive and emotional skills to gain any benefit from it. That includes teaching them about atrocities that happened TO Japan, such as Hiroshima."
stormagnet says, "And now, for something completely different"

Unsolicited bear-knocking
06/07/2005

A bear has become an unwanted guest in one Croatian town after learning how to knock on the door to trick people into letting it in.

The 35-stone monster knocked at the door of the Loknar family from Gerovo in western Croatia three times and they are now refusing to answer the door, ananova reports.

"I opened the door and saw him standing there and I didn't believe my eyes at first, then I ran for it as he walked in as if it was the most normal thing in the world," mother Nevenka Loknar said.

"Bears are a common thing in the woods around here, but no one has ever heard of a bear that knocks at the door.

"The bear is so intelligent it's incredible."

It appears as though the bear got lucky when he nudged the door for the first time and has continued to do so since believing he will get an answer again.
