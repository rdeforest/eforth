The Dense Forest
The trees crowd around thickly, and a heavy carpet of pine needles and broken branches cover the ground.  A park bench is here.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is hot and breezy.  The forest opens up into a clearing to the south.  You hear the sounds of water from an opening to the northeast.  A dark path leads a short distance west into the woods to a large, sagging wooden structure.

Tall, with brown hair and unearned unhappiness.  A fine layer of sawdust and a plume of sparks obscures your view of him.  His turns are standard rate and he is perfectly trimmed.  He has two eyes and an imposing thickness.  He is coherent and his latency is low.  His coefficients are scaled perfectly.  His gear reduction is free of backlash and his torque curve is linear.  He has low dispersion aspherical elements and focuses internally.  3.76% of Waterpoint is his fault.
Ben is sitting on the first couch between Clay and Charkes.
Ben seems uninjured.
Ben is wearing no visible pants.  He is wielding a NERF gun.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 30 minutes.
Carrying:
 a box of imported stuff                 a crate of nifty objnums
 Ben's generics catalog                  some mars_utils
 a bounds waif                           a towel
 a scaleinfo waif                        4 gold pieces
 Tabbed Form                             a blue frisbee
 Ben's GPS unit                          some fraction utils
 a compass                               two of Ben's armies
 a clear glass jar                       an offense
 a NERF gun                              an icepick
 a robot dog whistle                     a 74HC4046
 the captain's hat                       Ben's portfolio
 Object #6060                            a NERF dart
That is not a valid command.
You see no "~daved" here.
Everywhere you look, it's enlightenment and dogs in hats.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 7 hours.
Carrying:
 intensified bad states                  3 gold pieces
 Does the InterNet become waterproof???  
Newly slim, this tallish woman doesn't hulk.  She is wearing a mask with the face of melancholy.  She is holding some clay in the shape of atg logo (tm).  She is wearing a nice watch.  Where she is right now it's 0:03 AM.  She has fresh, minty breath.
She is awake, but has been staring off into space for 9 hours.
Carrying:

Mostly harmless.  Dangerous when water touches red.  He is carrying a delicious-looking thin sliver of birthday cake.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for an hour.
Carrying:
 a balloon                               a multiple-choice quiz
