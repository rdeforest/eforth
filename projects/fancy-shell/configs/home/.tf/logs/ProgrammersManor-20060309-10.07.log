There are several commands available to determine the origins of messages and to check that your communications with other players are secure. Help is available on the following topics:

@paranoid[1]
      keeping a record of messages your character hears.
@check[2]
      looking at that record to determine responsibility for messages.
@sweep[3]
      checking who is listening in on your conversation.

Binder really likes the way Steve builds anticipation between his sentence fragments.

Binder [to Crag]: See, at work, we use tinydns.
Binder [to Crag]: But, I hear you cry, why would you need nslint?
Binder [to Crag]: Because my boss has decreed that we shall convert to bind9.
Crag [to Binder]: why would you do that
Binder [to Crag]: So I have spent the week on a Perl script to convert tinydns pre-cdb data to zone files.
Binder [to Crag]: Because he distrusts tinydns.

Standing taller than a man, with enormous mandibles capable of grinding stone, the rock eater has a long tail with brown spots.
Binder says, "One interesting side effect of this process is that I've turned up some misconfiguration in the tinydns data file.  :)"
Crag says, "That sounds like a good thing"
Binder says, "ie, we define multiple soa records, which tinydns doesn't care about but which bind does."
Binder says, "It should have been done with ns records, instead."
Crag says, "oh, delegated zones?"
Crag says, "What's the harm in using SOAs?"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "You mean multiple SOAs for the same domain"
Binder says, "Yes, exactly."
Binder says, "tinydns doesn't care, and will return a random soa when asked."
Crag says, "Which is handy if you want a round-robin delegation :)"
Binder . o O ( but jdbp says don't go like that )
Crag says, "It seems like a bad idea, but I can't think of a reason to prohibit it"
Binder says, "I suspect it's because my grandboss [who originally implemented djbdns and is a big fan of it] just yank-pasted an soa line and assumed it was an ns line."
Binder says, "So his sloppiness got perpetuated to the 100+ domains the company has registered."
Binder says, "It can be hard to remember what all the punctuation prefixes mean in tinydns."
Crag says, "Is that part of the reason your boss doesn't trust djbdns?"
Crag says, "I don't think DJB intended people to hand-edit their data files"
Binder says, "I think my boss is very ... familiar ... with certain ... Unix ... habits."
