stormagnet says, "I have discovered what those little tissue dolls we keep seeing in anime are-"
stormagnet | It is fun living in Japan, though -- every day there's something new to see. One
stormagnet | cute thing that can be seen hanging from windows are Teru Teru Bozu, cute tissue
stormagnet | dolls which are made by anyone hoping for good weather. Deriving from "teru"
stormagnet | (fine weather) and "bozu" (a bald-headed Buddhist priest) and made out tissue
stormagnet | paper and string, Teru Teru Bozu are like little gods that will make the sun
stormagnet | shine tomorrow, although they may look like little ghosts to Western eyes. There
stormagnet | are variations in how to use Teru Teru Bozu -- usually you don't draw a face on
stormagnet | the doll until your wish for good weather comes true, but here in Gunma, I'm
stormagnet | told it's traditional to draw the face when you hang it up -- if you get your
stormagnet | wish for good weather, hang a silver bell on the doll as a way of saying thanks.
stormagnet | To see how to make one of these Japanese good-weather dolls, see this page:

stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Those tend to leave scars, though"
You say, "Hm"
You say, "Good point."
stormagnet says, "They also get infected, sometimes, which is just nasty. I tend to dissuade friends from getting them. There have been lots of lawsuits in the past."
You say, "Wow, I never heard about that."
stormagnet says, "Frankly, I'd like there to be an oral form, taken once every three months, like Depo :)"
You say, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "It's one of those things you only really hear about if you're female"

You say, "What i was going to say was"
You say, "Not very many people are going to inspect the scenery as closely as you want"
You say, "So there's not much value in nesting objects or coming up with a complicated 'detail system'"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, but it's kind of an artistic thing for me"
You say, "I know :)"
stormagnet says, "And I love the idea of having puzzles, and hiding clues"
You say, "It's a good idea!"
You say, "Because it's Something To Do"
You say, "For visitors"
You say, "But this core just isn't friendly to that yet"
You say, "Actually"
You say, "The _server_ isn't friendly"
You say, "Because the MOO parsing system is stupid"

Robert | Ken - .Tessa (my cat) licked the glass, and didn.t die..
stormagnet LAUGHS

stormagnet says, "I'm tempted to conduct this experiment at a party"
You say, "me too"
stormagnet says, "I would like to add an experiment criteria to determine if the filtered vodka is still as alcoholic. I haven't figured out how to figure that out, yet, though. Evaporation speed, maybe?"
You say, "I think there's probably a more reliable method than that."
You say, "it doesn't seem like filtration would remove alcohol though"
stormagnet nods
You say, "Ok"
You say, "I know what I was meaning to say about details"
You say, "It would be tedious to describe the entire environment bit by bit"
You say, "But we don't want everything automatic because that's just boring"
You say, "So we need to come up with a new way of describing the world which is more ..."
You say, "useful"
You say, "I can only think of an example:"
You say, "A charachter is in the huge hall with the painting in the old manor"
You say, "They're looking in the painting, presumably for clues."
You say, "Some of what they see will come from its being a $painting.oil: it's glossy, textured, etc"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Properties"
You say, "Some of what they see will come from its subject matter: buildings, animals, whatever"
You say, "Some of it will actually be specific to this particular painting: clues"
You say, "But there's one more thing"
You say, "The user may want to ask a question about the painting that the MOO can't answer"
You say, "And that should page a GM"
You say, "We're going to need a much more advanced world model to make this work"
You say, "We'll have to make the transition away from strict containership relationships"
stormagnet nods
You say, "The MOO becomes a kind of 'knowledgebase'"
You say, "The server tries to answer questions about the db, but falls back on humans"
stormagnet says, "We need a lot more sophisticated a system of handling object properties"
You say, "yes"
You say, "It will need to be rich enough to be the back-end of natural language generation, and probably parsing too"
You say, "So descriptions won't ever be blocks of text anymore"
You say, "They will be text renderings"
You say, "Much as shooters and RPGs have 3D renderings of scenes and objects"
stormagnet says, "Here's where we get into linguistics"
You say, "Instead of getting DOOM graphics, users will get "you're facing such-and-such, a shiny such and such...""
You say, "yes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Meaning maps"
You say, "That's what it all comes down to"
You say, "Oh yes"
You say, "Definitely"
You say, "we'll need an actual model system"

You say, "What I just described is a massive undertaking, so in the meantime I think you should go ahead and do whatever you want"
You say, "Write code, nest objects, whatever tickles you"
You say, "We'll port what we can, when we're ready, and re-do the rest."
stormagnet laughs
You say, "What I need most right now is some structure in my development process"
You say, "Documentation, a mission, goals, milestones"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "You know what that sounds like to me?"
You say, "what"

stormagnet | The Vatican has published a pamphlet called "It's a Sin Not to Do It," in
stormagnet | which the Church sanctions masturbation for married women, and urges
stormagnet | Catholics to get laid more in general. In an unrelated story, Italy and many
stormagnet | other Catholic nations are experiencing negative population growth.
stormagnet |
stormagnet |     Forty years ago, the Vatican published a notorious set of guidelines for
stormagnet | courting Catholics that outlawed even French kissing before marriage.
stormagnet |
stormagnet |     The pages of It's A Sin Not To Do It, however, feature a frank interview
stormagnet | with Cardinal Ersilio Tonini in which he emphasises that "the Church is not
stormagnet | an enemy of the flesh". He argues that Vatican doctrine has always defended
stormagnet | the "nobility of sexuality", which is regarded by the Church as a "treasure"
stormagnet | of humanity.

Robert idles: heading home
[Idling at 4:08 P.M. on Fri, Nov 12: heading home]
That is not a valid command.
That is not a valid command.
-----
IDLE
====

Syntax: idle
        idle message
        idle (dozing message) message
        reidle
        reidle message
        reidle (dozing message) message

The idle command lets you notify people that you are idling for some kind of activity.  You set an idle message by doing something like:

  idle to go the bathroom
 

Then, when someone looks at you, they'll see, appended to your description, the fact that you have idled to go to the bathroom.

In addition, people may see your idle message in @who listings or in other as yet undetermined locations.

As soon as you enter another command on the moo, you are no longer idle, so your idle message won't show up.

You can set how you are described when someone looks in a room as well (often referred to as your 'dozing' message).   If you do:

  idle (cooking dinner)
 

This will replace the usual (dozing), (sleeping) or related message, and will indicate to people when they walk in the room why you've idled.

You can combine both methods at the same time:

  idle (eating ice cream) going to the mall for a snack
 

If you don't set either message, the default will be printed.  The default idle message is "real life intrusion", while the default short description method is (idling).

You may set your default idle message to something else:

  @idle me is <new default message>
 

And your default dozing message:

  @dozing me is <new dozing message>
 

(Don't use parenthesis on your default dozing message... they're added automatically by the room description.)

Normally, when you idle, the fact that you're idling is announced to the room, along with the reason that you're idling.  If you would like to idle quietly, you can use the 'reidle' command instead.  This is often used when you've idled, then said something anyway, and want to reidle but not bother the other members of the room.
