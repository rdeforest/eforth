This Retro PDA Doesn't Need Batteries

By Mike Musgrove
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, July 17, 2005; F07

If you want to get organized but don't like new technologies, perhaps it's time to meet the hipster PDA.

The hipster PDA, or personal digital assistant, is a handheld that does not have Bluetooth, does not surf the Web and does not play Pac-Man.

But the pocket-sized, build-it-yourself organizer is cheap and foolproof in a way that only a stack of index cards held together with a binder clip can be. Because that's what it is.

The hipster PDA's originator, San Francisco writer Merlin Mann, says he got tired of lugging around his fourth or fifth Palm device and decided to go back to paper.

Mann thought up a catchy name for his new organizer and posted a write-up at his Web log, 43folders.com, a site where he meditates on Mac-related products and shares productivity tips. With a smattering of techno-marketing lingo, Mann introduced the hipster PDA as "a fully extensible system for coordinating incoming and outgoing data for any aspect of your life and work."

The slightly tongue-in-cheek blog entry, made in September, seems to have clicked with his readers. At Flickr.com, a Web site where bloggers collectively gather and share pictures of whatever they're into now, there are almost 200 photos of hPDAs in use, made by users around the world. Odder still, the folks using these homemade organizers are no Luddites; in many of the shots, laptops, fancy cell phones and digital cameras clamor for space alongside the index cards.

For years, Mann says, consumers have been trained to instinctively believe that technology can solve all a person's problems -- that a trip to Circuit City is all that stands between a person and organization. But Mann says that the hPDA is a "matter of using the right tool for the job" and "a philosophical decision about the kind of technology to let into your life."

The number of gadgets folks lug around is creeping ever upward, but "do you really need to carry $1,000 worth of equipment to have coffee with friends and be able to write down what albums you should check out?" he asked in a phone interview.

HPDA users like technology, but point out that if some personal task is really important, it's going to go on your computer anyway. A to-do list on paper, they say, is harder to ignore than one tucked away in a folder on a Palm Tungsten E. As for phone numbers, who needs a Palm to hold those when you've got a cell phone to store them all?

Mount Pleasant resident Bill Morocco's hipster PDA contains three color-coded sections, with index tabs designating sections for notes, to-do lists and money-related stuff.

Morocco used to own a Palm but now thinks of the hPDA as "a distillation of what the PDA was supposed to be" -- a simple, portable item that lets him organize his thoughts efficiently.

John S.J. Anderson, a systems administrator who lives in Gaithersburg, carries around a list of beers that he wants to try and a picture of his kid in his hPDA. The last card in his clipped-together pile reads, "Add more cards now."

Though Anderson tried about three times over the years to get his life in order using his Handspring organizer, the device never grabbed him. He worried about losing or breaking the thing. He never really liked the specialized handwriting system used in Palm devices -- it seemed a little clunky and it interrupted his thought flow whenever he was trying to jot down an idea.

What's the best part of using an hPDA? Whenever he accomplishes something on one of his to-do list cards, such as returning a reporter's phone call, he rips it up. It's really satisfying, he said, though he isn't sure why.

"I'm off the Palm thing," he said. "Regardless of how good you make it, I think it's still not going to be as good as paper."

Crag says, "Why's taht?"

Crag says, "I think you working at a coffee shop, even though you don't like coffee is a little like me working at Disney even though I don't like their movies, or ESPN's sports, or ABC's news, or anything else Disney does."

Cell Mutations That Lead To Apoptosis May Contribute To Aging In Mammals

GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- A University of Florida study has found that mutations in the mitochondria caused by obesity and lack of exercise -- not oxidative stress from free radicals -- may be a key factor in the aging process.

The study, published in this Friday's issue of Science magazine, finds that accumulation of mitochondrial mutations that promote apoptosis, or programmed cell death, may be a central mechanism driving aging and may be unrelated to the release of free radicals, previously thought to cause aging. This may be because of an accumulation of DNA mutations in the mitochondria, the cellular powerhouse that converts food to energy.

Results from the study may lead to more effective methods to prevent aging and stress the importance of a healthy lifestyle, said Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, an associate professor in the department of aging and geriatric research in the College of Medicine and contributing author of the study. He estimated that average maximum human lifespan could be increased from the current 70 years to more than 100 years with exercise and a proper diet.

"All the therapies have been targeted to reduce the free radical production in the mitochondria, and now it looks like that doesn't make complete sense," he said.

By breeding mice with the inability to detect and repair mistakes in the DNA replication process, researchers discovered there was no increase in oxidative stress despite an increased mutational load. However, there was a significant increase in apoptosis, said Leeuwenburgh.

In mammals, uncorrected mistakes can cause genetic disorders, aging or even death, said doctoral student Asimina Hiona, who was instrumental in the biochemical analysis of free radicals and apoptosis in the study. In the mutated mice, that ability was impaired so the cells could not repair themselves.

The finding disproves the previously believed mitochondrial "vicious cycle" theory of aging, which states that increases in mitochondrial mutations increase oxidative damage, which is one cause of aging.

"It was previously believed that the more mitochondrial mutations you have, the more free radicals you're going to produce," said Leeuwenburgh. "But that's one thing this paper shows, that that's not necessarily the case."

The mice used in the study were bred by Thomas Prolla, an associate professor and lead investigator of the paper, and Greg Kujoth, an assistant scientist, both of the genetics department at the University of Wisconsin.

"Mice with accelerated aging may be a useful system to discover compounds that improve function in aging individuals and perhaps retard or prevent some of the diseases associated with aging," Prolla said.

The researchers discovered that on average, the mutant mice lived a third as long as normal mice. At just nine months of age, they experienced significant loss of hair, hearing, bone mass, intestinal lining and overall weight, conditions similar to those of an aging human. Unaltered, the same mice normally live 30 to 32 months.

Also, no programmed cell death was observed between mutant and control mice at 3 months of age. However, by the time the mice reached 9 months, significant levels of programmed cell death were found in the testes, heart, thymus and other organs.

Although the mice were considered a "good model" of aging, they lacked a chronic inflammatory component which can cause cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and other health problems that affect individuals as they age. Chronic inflammation is associated with the increased production of free radicals produced by other sources, such as white blood cells.

"As we get old, we become stiff and have pains and processes that have inflammation," Leeuwenburgh said. He added that inflammation may be prevented by maintaining an ideal body weight through caloric restriction and exercise.

If people practice a healthy lifestyle, then stem-cell therapy, nanotechnology and special exercise and dietary interventions will be even more beneficial, he said.

Crag | The easiest pet to move is a turtle, which can be overnight expressed in a well cushioned, insulated box with air holes.
stormagnet says, "BUT I WOULDN'T"
Crag | American Tortoise Rescue (http://www.tortoise.com), a nonprofit organization founded to provide for the rescue of turtles and tortoises, recommends using overnight mail. Be sure to write "Fragile, Live Cargo" and "this side up" on the outside of the box to increase the chances of a softer ride. You can also place leaves or grass inside the container for added cushion and to give the box a more homey environment.

Volvo seeks permission to drink and drive
Thu Jul 21, 2005 01:28 PM ET

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Carmaker Volvo has asked for special exemption from Sweden's tough drink-driving laws so its test drivers can have a glass too many to test new safety systems that warn if a driver is not reacting to danger.

Volvo, whose success rests on its reputation for building safety-conscious family cars, will only let its drunk drivers take the wheel on its own test tracks near the west-coast city of Gothenburg if it gets permission from the Swedish government.

"It's a matter of developing technical systems that warn if the driver isn't reacting properly," said Christer Gustafsson, spokesman for Volvo Cars, which is owned by Ford.

"That means if the driver is tired, sick, drunk or under the influence of other drugs. We want to do this in a controlled environment in Sweden," he told Swedish news agency TT.

The new safety system is still at the development stage and Gustafsson said he could not give more details about how it works. "It's all about preventing accidents," he said.

Sweden has one of the best road-safety records in the world thanks partly to drink-driving laws which are among the toughest in Europe. The laws apply to private and public roads.

Stockholm County Traffic Police said the most drivers could drink without risking a heavy fine is one beer, while drivers caught well over the limit can be sent to prison.
