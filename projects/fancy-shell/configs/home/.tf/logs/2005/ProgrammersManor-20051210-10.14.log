Taken further:

I don't care how well you can drive, no one is perfect, and that one day that someone drives imperfectly is the day I don't want to be near them.  I'm for no driving.

Life is dangerous.  Making everything illegal is not the solution.  It's already illegal to cause an accident.  It is not necessary to legislate all the different ways a person can be irresponsible.  Some people are fully capable of doing those things reponsibly.  There are some people who will never be safe drivers no matter how many restrictions we place on them.  The only sensible solution is education and attempting to extract appropriate compensation from those who cause accidents.

This culture of preventive legislation demeans us as capable humans and re-enforces the notion that we're incapable of taking care of ourselves and a menace to those around us.  This is certainly true of some people but legislating for the lowest common denominator only allows and encourages us to degrade even further.

Furthermore, this cell-phone antagonism that is so popular these days just smacks of classism.  "Those damn yuppies in their SUVs, drinking their lattes and talking on their cellphones with their stock brokers!"  Get over it.  Talking on cell phones in restaruants isn't rude.  Talking loudly in a restaurant, on or off a phone, is rude.  Driving while talking on a cell phone isn't any more dangerous than talking to rambunctions children while driving.  It's not the talking, the children, or the cell phone that causes the accident.  It's the driver.  The human being with free will and personal responsibility is the only person who can prevent accidents.  Not the police, not the politicians, and not the vocal antagonists of individuality and personal freedom.

Researchers to trap mysterious cat-fox animal

GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Environmental researchers are preparing to
capture what they call a new, mysterious species of carnivore on Borneo, the
first such discovery on the wildlife-rich Indonesian island in over a century.

Swiss-based environmental group WWF said on Monday its researchers
photographed the strange animal, which looks like a cross between a cat and a
fox, in the dense, central mountainous rainforests of Borneo.

"This could be the first time in more than a century that a new carnivore has
been discovered on the island," said the WWF in a statement.

The mammal, slightly larger than a cat with red fur and a long tail, was
photographed twice by a camera trap at night.

Locals and wildlife experts who viewed photographs of the animal, which has
very small ears and large hind legs, said they had never seen such a creature
before and were convinced that it was a new species, WWF said.

Researchers hope to confirm the discovery by setting cage traps to catch a
live specimen, but warn that Indonesian government plans to clear the
rainforest to create the world's largest palm oil plantation may interfere
with plans, WWF said.

The proposed plantation scheme, funded by the China Development Bank, is
expected to cover an area of 1.8 million hectares, equivalent to about half
the size of The Netherlands, said the WWF, formerly known as the World Wide
Fund for Nature.

The potential new species of carnivore in Borneo would be the first since the
discovery of the Borneo ferret-badger in 1895, the WWF said.

Pictures of the animal were first taken by WWF researchers in 2003, the
photos kept unpublished by the WWF as research continued. The WWF decided to
make public the photos with the release of a book about Borneo, to be
published on Tuesday.

Freedom of speech, by necessity, includes freedom after speech. In the real world, that usually requires anonymity. 
 
 
In this particular situation, the speech involved counts as a stupid joke, or possibly a subtle political jab. If, instead, the relevant Wiki article had included concrete evidence that Bush and Blair lied to the world for the purpose of controlling the world Mango market, or a leaked internal memo showing the Diebold CEO deliberately made defective machines that gave extra votes to Libertarians - Would we still consider it an .abuse. of free speech, or exactly the reason we need free speech? 
 
 
Yes, with free speech comes a certain degree of responsibility. On the part of the AUDIENCE. Charlatans and outright liers will always exist, and would even if we didn.t have a 1st amendment in the US. Anyone who accepts a single Wiki entry as .proof. of ANYTHING deserves the ridicule they get when more skeptical readers point out the real facts.

Crag says, "All the Zauruses?"
Crag says, "That's weird"
Crag says, "I wonder if something sketchy happened that we'll never know about"

Crag says, "And then when they have a more solid product, re-introduce to the US"

Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Those are almost identical specs to the portrait formfactor zauruses"
Crag says, "If you could plug a keyboard into it... :)"
Crag says, "Ah, it costs about twice as much as a Zaurus SL-6000L from their own store"
Crag says, "But still"

Crag says, "Awesome toy"
Crag says, "Incredibly valuable to rescue crews and such"

stormagnet says, "Guess I'd better just stick with the tablet for now"
stormagnet says, "But that is SO COOL!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "it's not a bad deal either, if you need a gps unit"
Crag says, "Good GPS units are hundreds of dollars, and having that mated to a zaurus is a big win"
Crag says, "The capability to tie in to, just of the top of my head, google maps, is great"
Crag says, "And then for it to be unencumbered by windowsism opens up even more possibilities"
Crag says, "Might make a replacement for the units delivery people cary"
Crag says, "Especially if they added a barcode reader and label printer"
Crag says, "I can think of lots of uses for something like that"
Crag says, "Oh!"

Crag says, "The current GPS system's best accuracy is around 10m"
Crag says, "I just figured out one can enter lattitude and longitude in on google maps and have it jump to and mark that point"
