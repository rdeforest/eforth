You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
Minty and Marcy are here.  stormagnet is distracted.
Minty says, "w00!"
stormagnet says, "We should make that cake factory operational"
stormagnet . o O ( caaakke... )
stormagnet drools
Marcy giggles.
There are no features in the feature object registry matching "paste".
Minty [to Crag]: I owe you one for @booting me ;)
stormagnet stares off into the distance
Minty says, "ROFL!"
Crag [to Minty]: Sure
Minty says, "lol"
Minty says, "Nah"

Minty says, "Wow, we get more quota here than we did elseMOO!"
Minty . o O ( 100,000 bytes )
Marcy says, "cool"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "The machine only has 256M of ram, so we can't go to crazy just now."
Crag says, "Current process size is..."

Crag says, "Only 6M, yay"
Minty says, "But that's twice what we get elseMOO."
Crag says, "Yeah"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "MOOs are historically stingy with quota because they have an open joining policy"
Crag says, "Since we're a little exclusive we can afford to be generous"
Minty says, "Ohhh"
Marcy says, "ohhh"
Minty yays!
Crag [to Minty]: as a wizard you can give people quota
Minty nods.
Crag says, "Feel free to give them as much as you like."
Crag says, "BUT"
Minty doesn't know how to though.
Minty laughs.
Crag says, "It should be clear to people that we want to stay somewhat on-theme here"
Minty tries to learn.
Crag says, "So no extreme sci-fi or weirdness or whatever"
Minty [to Crag]: okay.

@QUOTA
======

Usage:  @quota [<someone>]

Each player has a limit as to how much database disk space e may consume with their objects, properties, and verbs.  Objects are periodically measured (and can have their measurement forced---see help @measure).  If a player is over quota after a measurement, e will not be able to @create any objects, use @copy, @verb, or @property to grow any objects.  Existing properties and verbs may be edited/changed at will, even while over quota.

The @quota command prints out your current quota and measured usage.  If you have more than one character, it will summarize all your other characters' usage as well.

@quota <player> will print out the quota and usage of another player.  [Note: you will not be able to obtain second character information for another player; whether primary or secondary character, the @quota display will only show one character's quota.]

@quota prints a time of measurement in its display.  This is the time of the oldest measurement out of all your objects.  For example, if you @measure three of your objects right now, those individual times get updated, but if you still have a couple of objects with older measurements, that older time will be the time printed by @quota.  This is confusing to many people.

If you want to get more quota, please see `help quota-policy'[1].


 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax:  @quota <player> is <number> [<reason>]

This second and more interesting form of the verb changes a player's quota to the given number.  Mail will be sent to $quota_log; the message will include the <reason> if such is given.

Crag [to Minty]: help @quota

`HELP THEME' NOT FOUND
======================

Sorry, but no help is available on `theme'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

Minty [to Crag]: So I can't build a place called 'Some Beach'?
Crag says, "I need to write 'help theme' soon"
Minty [to Crag]: okay
Crag [to Minty]: Not without incorporating it into the existing scenery
Crag says, "This manor could be located near a waterfront"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "So if you were to extend the road past the wall down to a beach, that would be ok"
Minty [to Crag]: We have plenty of time to do all that.
Crag nods.
Crag [to Minty]: Have you been around the whole Manor grounds?
Marcy says, "I'll be back later"
Crag [to Marcy]: Ok!
Crag [to Marcy]: good to see you again
Minty [to Crag]: Nope
Marcy [to stormagnet]: Nice to have met you
Minty huggles Marcy.
Marcy [to Crag]: thanks, you too
Marcy huggles Minty.
Crag [to Minty]: Next time you log in and everyone's idle, wander around and check stuff out

Minty [to Crag]: I don't know what all is here, or what their numbers are.
Crag says, "Both for the building and the outside."
Crag says, "That's ok, these things take time"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "ANyway, we have a kind of magical realism thing we're going for here."
Minty says, "Ahhh"
Minty says, "okay"
Crag says, "We're avoiding things which would narrow down the time period, like vehicals"
Minty says, "Ahhh"
Crag says, "We want it to be possible for this to be anywhere in the western world, from about 1400 to a little in the future."
Minty says, "Lots I need to learn."
Crag grins.
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I should be documenting this"
Minty giggles.
Crag says, "BUt I am logging it at least"
Crag says, "I can make something of the logs later."
