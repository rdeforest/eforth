PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

For assistance either now or later, type `help'.

Syntax:  @audit [<player>] [for <string>] [from <number>] [to <number>] 

`@audit'        prints a report of all of the objects you own.
`@audit player' prints the same report for another player.

The `for' string restricts the search to objects whose names begin with that string.
It is also possible to restrict the range of object numbers to include only those above a given number (`from') or below a given number (`to').

All forms of @audit print a report:

   #14 Gemba                          [The Pool]
  #144 Popgun                         [Gemba]
 #1479 Cockatoo                      *[The Living Room]
 #1673 Bottom of Swimming Pool       
 #2147 Cavern                        <-*west
 #2148 tunnel                         Bottom of Swimming ->Cavern

The first column is the object's number, the second its name. The third column shows the object's location: Gemba is in The Pool, and is carrying the Popgun (#144).
For exits, the third column shows source ->dest.
For rooms, the third column shows any entrances owned by someone else.
Object location, exit sources and destinations owned by another player are preceded by a *.

@audit uses a property .owned_objects on the player, for speed.  This property is updated at the time of each object creation and destruction and ownership change.  The verb @auditdb (same args as @audit) actually searches through the entire database for objects.

See also @verify-owned, @sort-owned, and @add-owned.

See also @prospectus, which gives some additional information.

That object does not define that property.

Showing help on `@measure':
----
Syntax:
  @measure object <object name>
  @measure summary [player]
  @measure new [player]
  @measure breakdown <object name>
  @measure recent [number of days] [player]

When the MOO is under byte-quota, objects in the MOO are measured approximately once a week, and the usage tally as reported by @quota is updated.  You may wish to measure an object specially, however, without waiting for the automatic measurement to take place, or if the MOO is under object-quota.  @measure has some subcommands to handle this.

@measure object will measure an individual object right now, update the usage of that object in your usage as reported by @quota, and update the date of that object's measurement.

@measure summary will go through your or another player's objects and produce the summary information that is printed by @quota.  Normally this will be just the same as @quota prints out, but occasionally the addition/subtraction done to keep @quota in sync will get out of date, and @measure summary will be needed.

@measure new will go through all your or another player's objects, measuring exactly those which have never been measured before (that is, are too newly @created to have any measurement data).  This is necessary as any player is only permitted to own 10 unmeasured objects, or object creation will not be permitted.

@measure breakdown will give you full information on where an object's size is coming from.  It will offer to moomail you the result.  Caution: don't forget to delete this message, as it is large and takes up a lot of space!

@measure recent will let you re-measure objects of yours or another player's which have not been measured in the specified number of days (the default is the ordinary cycle of the measurement task).

I made the help change.  Why the line 15 change?  I kinna like the == "" better -- it makes it excruciatingly clear exactly what type of false value it's looking for.

Thanks, I fixed this. I turned off something to try to avoid the timeout, but I guess it didn't work. Oh well, at least the moo gets some excitement for a bit, even if it's at my expense.

You can take 17 to 280 or you can just get to highway 1 and take that to 19th avenue.  take 19th to Kirkham Street (streets go in backwards alphabetical).  address if you want it (heh) is 439 Kirkham.  Phone number if you get lost is (415) 759-9447.  1-ish tomorrow ok?  We can probably just walk to the Haight, it's only 15 minutes away.

not much is really going on here. just hanging out with friends. not anything really too big.
life is dull sometimes.
i havn't slowed down. things just are less interesting and meaningful.
hmm. how's the dancing going??
hope to see you soon.

The happiest girl you ever knew. She smiles as if she hasn't a care in the world... or maybe it's because she loves to be naughty sometimes.

I am sending this, I HOPE to anyone that I've spoken to often enough that
they'd want to find me.  I am turning this character over to a friend, as I will no longer have access..
To be on the safe side, as I do not know if you will want to speak to this person
I would suggest that you remove me from the watch-for lists...
thank you for your friendships, and I'm sure we'll get in touch.. 
IF you need to find me, after Friday...page Dragyn, as she will be able to 
track me down.
Thanks again.

I'm located in Boston.. it's a bit far to meet for coffee :) but I am planning on making a visit to sf this summer, so maybe we could meet up then sometime.. I'm planning on having a visit with Sandy's mother while I am there.
I understand about phones.. they can be weird, it's just an easy way to get a hold of me because I don't spend as much time here as I used to.
Anyway, all this sadness has awakened some creative energy in me.. it is really hard sometimes.. and I wouldn't be surprised if she is sep er speaking to us still :)

@claim #5365 will claim insaan's Real Life Registery

instead of

@claim #5336 which claims insaan's utils which are also interesting

Both could use caretakers.  Sorry for the confusing typo.

Thanks, I fixed this. I turned off something to try to avoid the timeout, but I guess it didn't work. Oh well, at least the moo gets some excitement for a bit, even if it's at my expense.
