Waterpoint: subtle and ponderous[301]

The Dense Forest
The trees crowd around thickly, and a heavy carpet of pine needles and broken branches cover the ground.  A park bench is here.  The day is finally surrendering to the night as the light fades to the west.  It is hot and breezy.  The forest opens up into a clearing to the south.  You hear the sounds of water from an opening to the northeast.  A dark path leads a short distance west into the woods to a large, sagging wooden structure.

Subject:  disk replaced

One of the disks in the machine Waterpoint runs on developed lots of disk read errors.   I've replaced it.   That's what happened to our uptime.

(No data was lost; it was the backup target drive.   It is kind of irritating, though, since the drive was less than a year old.)
