Crag says, "meh, fruitbat are boring"
Crag . o O ( are? is? )
Crag says, "Ah, they're "Fruit Bats" anyway.  And they're boring."
Crag | In 1986, the National Institutes of Health began an aggressive breeding program that nearly doubled the number of research chimps in the country, on the seemingly logical but ultimately incorrect assumption that our closest genetic kin would serve as ideal models for developing a vaccine. Chimps, it turns out, can contract the virus, but they are virtually immune to its effects.

Crag says, "I think we may skip mechanical nanotech entirely in favor of biological nanotech"
Crag says, "So we'll get to The Diamond Age, but there won't be micro motors or anything"

Gene engineered stem cells heal rat spines -study
Tue Jul 26, 2005 05:11 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Genetically engineered stem cells can help rats' severed spinal cords grow back together, according to a study published on Tuesday.

Rats given the treatment, using stem cells taken from rat embryos, could move their legs again after their spines were severed in the lab, said the researchers' report in the Journal of Neuroscience.

The scientists hope the approach, which generated a new fatty cover for the spinal cord cells called the myelin sheath, also could be shown to work in people.

The key is using the right stem cells and then stimulating them correctly, said the researchers, who were led by Scott Whittemore of the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky.

"These findings suggest the possibility that transplantation therapy using a subset of neural stem cells and neurotrophic factors might improve functional recovery in human spinal cord injury," said Dr. Michael Selzer, a professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia.

Spinal cord injuries can be caused by accidents or infections and affect 250,000 people a year in the United States alone, costing $4 billion annually, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders.

Whittemore's team took specific cells from rat embryos called glial restricted precursor cells -- a kind of stem cell or master cell that gives rise to nerve cells.

They genetically engineered these cells to do a little extra work by producing a compound called a growth factor -- in this case, a new one called multineurotrophin. It was designed to coax immature neural stem cells to mature and become specialized cells called oligodendrocytes.

Oligodendrocytes help myelin grow onto nerve fibers, which cannot grow or function without this fatty protective coating.

Two-thirds of the rats in the study regained some hind limb movement, the researchers said.

Life During Flypaper

As the body count in Iraq has continued its rise over the last few months,
with increasingly hideous attacks carried out by an increasingly vicious
terrorist insurgency, some have noted that the uptick in violence has not
produced a 9/11-esque welling of solidarity, an explosion of voices
proclaiming that We Are All Iraqis Now. What separates Iraqi deaths from
Western deaths? It is not, let the Medium Lobster assure you, ethnicity,
religion, culture, wealth, and an avalanche of press coverage sliding away
from an increasingly horrifying bloody mistake of a war. No, what makes Iraqi
deaths so much more palatable is the fact that while every Western death has
been a senseless murder committed in the name of an empty and lunatic cause,
each Iraqi death has been a proud and noble sacrifice to preserve the Western
way of life.

As President Bush has pointed out, America is fighting the terrorists abroad
so it won't have to face them at home - diverting the enemy from attacking
America and Europe by cleverly tricking them into attacking Iraq instead.
Following this ingenious strategy, every bomb detonated by an insurgent in
Iraq is necessarily a bomb detonated to protect the Western alliance; every
body in Baghdad is necessarily a life saved in New York. The free world is
preserved by the ongoing demolition of the third world.

Indeed, if there's a criticism to be made of the current situation in Iraq,
it's that there aren't enough terrorist attacks. If there were, there
wouldn't be enough terrorists outside Iraq to attack London. Either our
troops aren't doing enough to attract terrorists to Iraq, or Iraqis aren't
providing tempting enough targets. For the sake of the homefront, the Medium
Lobster encourages all coalition troops to deface a mosque at least once a
day, and all Iraqi civilians to wear bright concentric targets as often as
they can. If an Iraqi sees a suspicious Sunni extremist or foreign jihadi on
your way to work, he should offer him a spare car bomb or a packet of
explosives. Suicide-bombing is a sign of desperation, and we should endeavor
to make the enemy as desperate as possible.

I think I've seen video of those rats.....the spine heals, but it's all pell
mell.  Like spinal synthesasia, permanently.  So your brain has to seriously
rewire to learn which wire does what....like blindfolding Lili Tomlin or
something.  The rats could move their backends, which was better than
nothing, but it's pretty jerky fucked up shit.

Blind teen amazes with video game ability

LINCOLN, Nebraska (AP) -- Brice Mellen is a whiz at video games such as
"Mortal Kombat."

In that regard, the 17-year-old isn't much different from so many others his
age.

Except for one thing: He's blind.

And as he easily dispatched foes who took him on recently at a Lincoln gaming
center, the affable and smiling Mellen remained humble.

"I can't say that I'm a superpro," he said, working the controller like an
extension of his body. "I can be beat."

Those bold enough to challenge him weren't so lucky. One by one, while
playing "Soul Caliber 2," their video characters were decapitated,
eviscerated and gutted without mercy by Mellen's on-screen alter ego.

"I'm getting bored," Mellen said in jest as he won game after game.

Blind since birth when his optic nerve didn't connect because of Leber's
disease, Mellen honed his video game skills over the years through patient
and not-so-patient playing, memorizing key joystick operations and moves in
certain games, asking lots of questions and paying particular attention to
audio cues. He worked his way up from games such as "Space Invaders" and
"Asteroid," onto the modern combat games.

"I guess I don't know how I do it, really," Mellen said, as he continued
playing while facing away from the screen. "It's beyond me."

Mellen knows this much: He started playing at home when he was about 7.

"He enjoyed trying to play, but he wasn't very good at first," said his
father, Larry Mellen. "But he just kept on trying. ... He's broken a lot of
controllers."

When the question of broken controllers comes up, Mellen flashes a smile and
just shrugs.

"I used to have quite a temper," he said. "Me and controllers didn't get
along very well."

Now they get along just fine.
While playing "Soul Caliber 2," Mellen worked his way through the
introductory screens with ease, knowing exactly what to click to start the
game he wanted.

He rarely asked for help. Once the game started he didn't need any help.

"How do I move?" an exasperated opponent, Ryan O'Banion, asked during a
battle in which his character is frozen in place.

"You can't," Mellen answered before finishing him off.

"That's what happens. It's why I don't play him," O'Banion said after his
blood-spattered character's corpse vanishes from the screen.

How Mellen became so good is a mystery to his father.

"He just sat there and he tried and tried until he got it right," Larry
Mellen said. "He didn't ever complain to me or anyone about how hard it was."

Mellen hangs out any chance he gets at the DogTags Gaming Center in Lincoln,
which opened last month. Every now and then someone will come in and think he
can easily beat the blind kid.

That attitude doesn't faze Mellen.

"I'll challenge them, maybe. If I feel like a challenge," he said, displaying
an infectious confidence. "I freak people out by playing facing backwards."

There's nothing he likes better than playing video games, Mellen said.

He will be a senior in high school next year. After graduation, he plans to
take a year off because he wants a break from school.

When he does go to college, Mellen wants to study video game design.
