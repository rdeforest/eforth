PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Petition #33225 has received enough signatures to transform it into open Ballot:Double (#33225): `Double Everyone's Quota', which is now available for voting.  Type `read #33225' to see the text of the proposal and then `vote yes on #33225' to cast your vote in favor of it, `vote no on #33225' to cast your vote against it, or `abstain on #33225' to stop hearing about it.  Voting on this ballot will close on Friday, September 16, at 9:38 am, LambdaMOO Standard Time; until then, you can change your vote as often as you wish.  You can read (and contribute to) commentary on this proposal on the mailing list named *Ballot:Double; type `help mail' for details.

As a wiz in LambdaCore 'help @make-player' shows:

@make-player name [email-address [commentary]]

This seems to indicate that the email-address is optional, which it is not. If there is no email address given, @make-player gives the traceback:

#57:@make-player (this == #2), line 9:  Range error

Turns out the doc is already corrected in the current lambdamoo (#1130.("@make-player")).

No News (is good news)
Sorry, but no help is available on `@make-player'.
That object does not define that verb.
