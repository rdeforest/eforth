PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Subject:  Some sf.net CVS updates

I had not realized how far behind HEAD the WAIF branch had fallen, so I merged it.  The WAIF branch is now up to date as of yesterday.  *Today* I committed a change to HEAD to open_network_connection() which adds a third argument that specifies what listener should be associated with the new outbound connection.  I also fixed a longstanding bug that outbound connections relying on :do_login_command to connect them had to get network input before the :dlc would be called.  Connections with no listener specified get the old behavior (suitable for read() access to the connection) but new connections with a specific listener (even if #0 is just named explicitly) will now get that empty-command kick in the pants.
