I suppose earlier generations had to sit through all this huffing and puffing
with the invention of television, the phone, cinema, radio, the car, the
bicycle, printing, the wheel and so on, but you would think we would learn the
way these things work, which is this:

1) everything that.s already in the world when you.re born is just normal;

2) anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is
incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out
of
it;

3) anything that gets invented after you.re thirty is against the natural
order
of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until
it.s
been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright
really.

Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to
work out how old you are.

How many times has the US tried to wipe out the Jews or started World War II?
None - which is more than Hitler can say. Hitler killed ten million innocent
people in camps over the 1930s and 40s. America has only killed about a
hundred innocent people in prison camps over three years. At this rate it'll
take the US thirty thousand years to beat Hitler's record. Hitler isn't too
impressed with America's badness, I can tell you that.

 Grandfather kills leopard with his hands

Wed Jun 22,11:42 AM ET

A 73-year-old Kenyan grandfather reached into the mouth of an attacking
leopard and tore out its tongue to kill it, authorities said Wednesday.

Peasant farmer Daniel M'Mburugu was tending to his potato and bean crops in a
rural area near Mount Kenya when the leopard charged out of the long grass
and leapt on him.

M'Mburugu had a machete in one hand but dropped that to thrust his fist down
the leopard's mouth. He gradually managed to pull out the animal's tongue,
leaving it in its death-throes.

"It let out a blood-curdling snarl that made the birds stop chirping," he
told the daily Standard newspaper of how the leopard came at him and knocked
him over.

The leopard sank its teeth into the farmer's wrist and mauled him with its
claws. "A voice, which must have come from God, whispered to me to drop the
panga (machete) and thrust my hand in its wide open mouth. I obeyed,"
M'Mburugu said.

As the leopard was dying, a neighbor heard the screams and arrived to finish
it off with a machete.

M'Mburugu was toasted as a hero in his village Kihato after the incident
earlier this month. He was also given free hospital treatment by astonished
local authorities.

"This guy is very lucky to be alive," Kenya Wildlife Service official Connie
Maina told Reuters, confirming details of the incident.

 Supreme Court Rules Cities May Seize Homes

By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer 24 minutes ago

The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that local governments may seize people's
homes and businesses . even against their will . for private economic
development.

It was a decision fraught with huge implications for a country with many
areas, particularly the rapidly growing urban and suburban areas, facing
countervailing pressures of development and property ownership rights.

The 5-4 ruling represented a defeat for some Connecticut residents whose
homes are slated for destruction to make room for an office complex. They
argued that cities have no right to take their land except for projects with
a clear public use, such as roads or schools, or to revitalize blighted areas.

As a result, cities now have wide power to bulldoze residences for projects
such as shopping malls and hotel complexes in order to generate tax revenue.

Local officials, not federal judges, know best in deciding whether a
development project will benefit the community, justices said.

"The city has carefully formulated an economic development that it believes
will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including . but by no
means limited to . new jobs and increased tax revenue," Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the majority.

He was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

At issue was the scope of the Fifth Amendment, which allows governments to
take private property through eminent domain if the land is for "public use."

Susette Kelo and several other homeowners in a working-class neighborhood in
New London, Conn., filed suit after city officials announced plans to raze
their homes for a riverfront hotel, health club and offices.

New London officials countered that the private development plans served a
public purpose of boosting economic growth that outweighed the homeowners'
property rights, even if the area wasn't blighted.

Starbucks or Wal-Mart.  jesus christ i'm terrified of this kind of shit.]

Gary Watkins, eleven years old, was absorbed in chasing lizards when Weela,
the family Pit Bull, plowed into him with a body slam that sent him
sprawling. Gary's mother, Lori, saw the whole incident and remembers being
surprised at first, because Weela always played kindly with children. But her
surprise quickly turned to horror when she saw a rattlesnake sink its fangs
into Weela's face.

Somehow Weela had sensed the snake's presence from across the yard and rushed
to push Gary out of strinking range. Luckily for thirty people, twenty-nine
dogs, thirteen horses and a cat, Weela recovered from the snake's venom.
Luckily, because that's how many lives she saved a few years later. For her
heroism, Weela was named Ken-L Ration's Dog Hero of the Year in 1993.

The press release read in part: "In January 1993, heavy rains caused a dam to
break miles upstream on the Tijuana River, normally a narrow, three-foot wide
river. Weela's rescue efforts began at a ranch that belonged to a friend of
her owners, Lori and Daniel Watkins.

Weela and the Watkinses worked for six hours battling heavy rains, strong
currents and floating debris to reach the ranch and rescue their friend's
twelve dogs. From that experience, the Watkinses recognized Weela's
extraordinary ability to sense quicksand, dangerous drop-offs and mud bogs.
"She was constantly willing to put herself in dangerous situations," says
Lori Watkins. "She always took the lead except to circle back if someone
needed help."

'Periodically, over a month's time, sixty-five pound Weela crossed the
flooded river to bring food to seventeen dogs and puppies and one cat, all
stranded on an island. Each trip she pulled thirty to fifty pounds of dog
food that had been loaded into a harnessed backpack. The animals were finally
evacuated on Valentine's Day.

On another occasion, Weela led a rescue team to thirteen horses stranded on a
large manure pile completely surrounded by floodwaters. The rescue team
successfully brought the horses to safe ground. Finally, during one of
Weela's trips back from delivering food to stranded animals, she came upon a
group of thirty people who were attempting to cross the floodwaters.

Weela, by barking and running back and forth, refused to allow them to cross
at that point where the waters ran deep and fast. She then led the group to a
shallower crossing upstream, where they safely crossed to the other side."

Stong, gentle intelligent and brave, Weela, CGC,TT, is the ultimate American
Pit Bull terrier, epitomizing the best that the breed has to offer. But her
story also highlights an important yet often mis- understood fact about the
breed. The Pit Bull is a dog that loves to please its owner and tries to
become whatever kind of dog its owner desires.

Weela has had two owners. The first owner dumped her in an alley to die when
she was less than four weeks old. Her present owner, Lori Watkins, found five
starving Pit Bull puppies whimpering in an alley, took them home and raised
them. later, the Watkins family placed four of the puppies in loving homes
and kept the little female they named Weela. They believed Weela was special,
and she proved them right.

Most Pit Bull puppies grow up to become a reflection of both their owners'
personality and the care and training they receive. One can only imagine what
a different dog Weela would have become if her original owner had raised her,
and she had done her best to please him. {HOME}

Scientists spot signal from solar-sail craft
By Lucy Sherriff
Published Wednesday 22nd June 2005 10:13 GMT

Cosmos 1, the experimental, solar sail-powered spacecraft launched yesterday from a Russian submarine, has gone missing. Although faint signals detected by tracking stations seem to suggest that the craft is alive and well, mission scientists don't seem to be able to find it in orbit.

The mission has been jointly funded by a TV production company and the California-based Planetary Society, a space advocacy group founded by the astronomer, science fiction author, and champion of science in general, Carl Sagan. Bruce Murray, co-founder of the Planetary Society, said yesterday that the signals were very good news because it meant the craft was "very likely in orbit".

Mission controllers lost contact with the craft almost as soon as it blasted off yesterday evening, and was presumed lost. However, after some hours, tracking stations in Russia, the Czech Republic and the Pacific Ocean all reported faint signals from the craft.

Scientists suspect that the final rocket burn sent the spacecraft slightly off course, so that although it made it into orbit, it is not in the orbit they expected. If this was the case, ground-based antennae hunting for Cosmos 1 would now be trained on the wrong part of the sky, which would account for the weak signals.

The scientists said they would ask US Strategic Command, normally charged with spotting incoming missiles, or other sky-based threats, for help in tracking down their spacecraft.

The possibility exists that the craft is in a decaying orbit and will eventually spiral down towards Earth.

The original plan was for the craft to orbit the planet, taking pictures for four days, before unfurling its solar sail. The sails would form a 30m circle that would provide a very slight, but constant, acceleration using the pressure of solar photons. Over a period of weeks, the craft's speed should increase so that it achieves escape velocity.

The aim of the project is to show that controlled flight is possible using solar sails.

Google developing online payment system - CEO
Tue Jun 21, 2005 07:01 PM ET

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Web search leader Google Inc.(GOOG.O: Quote, Profile, Research) is developing an online payment system but is not building a direct rival to eBay Inc.'s (EBAY.O: Quote, Profile, Research) PayPal, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said on Tuesday.

The comments from Google's CEO came after several days of heated speculation, following published reports that the company was working on potential rival to PayPal (EBAY.O: Quote, Profile, Research) , eBay's popular online payment system.

Schmidt said Google does not intend to offer a "person-to-person stored-value payments system" like PayPal's, in which money briefly resides in PayPal's control during the transaction, but he did not give details of how the Google plan would differ.

"The payment services we are working on are a natural evolution of Google's existing online products and advertising programs, which today connect millions of consumers and advertisers," Schmidt told Reuters in a brief telephone interview in which he declined to elaborate.

"We believe that e-commerce can be improved and we are working on ways to improve the user experience," Schmidt said.

Shares of Google closed up $1.14, or 0.4 percent, to $287.84. Shares of eBay finished down 34 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $36.90 prior to Schmidt's comments. Both stocks trade on the Nasdaq.

Pentagon Creating Student Database
Recruiting Tool For Military Raises Privacy Concerns

By Jonathan Krim
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, June 23, 2005; A01

The Defense Department began working yesterday with a private marketing firm to create a database of high school students ages 16 to 18 and all college students to help the military identify potential recruits in a time of dwindling enlistment in some branches.

The program is provoking a furor among privacy advocates. The new database will include personal information including birth dates, Social Security numbers, e-mail addresses, grade-point averages, ethnicity and what subjects the students are studying.

The data will be managed by BeNow Inc. of Wakefield, Mass., one of many marketing firms that use computers to analyze large amounts of data to target potential customers based on their personal profiles and habits.

"The purpose of the system . . . is to provide a single central facility within the Department of Defense to compile, process and distribute files of individuals who meet age and minimum school requirements for military service," according to the official notice of the program.

Privacy advocates said the plan appeared to be an effort to circumvent laws that restrict the government's right to collect or hold citizen information by turning to private firms to do the work.

Some information on high school students already is given to military recruiters in a separate program under provisions of the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act. Recruiters have been using the information to contact students at home, angering some parents and school districts around the country.

School systems that fail to provide that information risk losing federal funds, although individual parents or students can withhold information that would be transferred to the military by their districts. John Moriarty, president of the PTA at Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, said the issue has "generated a great deal of angst" among many parents participating in an e-mail discussion group.

Under the new system, additional data will be collected from commercial data brokers, state drivers' license records and other sources, including information already held by the military.

"Using multiple sources allows the compilation of a more complete list of eligible candidates to join the military," according to written statements provided by Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke in response to questions. "This program is important because it helps bolster the effectiveness of all the services' recruiting and retention efforts."

The Pentagon's statements added that anyone can "opt out" of the system by providing detailed personal information that will be kept in a separate "suppression file." That file will be matched with the full database regularly to ensure that those who do not wish to be contacted are not, according to the Pentagon.

But privacy advocates said using database marketers for military recruitment is inappropriate.

"We support the U.S. armed forces, and understand that DoD faces serious challenges in recruiting for the military," a coalition of privacy groups wrote to the Pentagon after notice of the program was published in the Federal Register a month ago. "But . . . the collection of this information is not consistent with the Privacy Act, which was passed by Congress to reduce the government's collection of personal information on Americans."

Chris Jay Hoofnagle, West Coast director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the system "an audacious plan to target-market kids, as young as 16, for military solicitation."

He added that collecting Social Security numbers was not only unnecessary but posed a needless risk of identity fraud. Theft of Social Security numbers and other personal information from data brokers, government agencies, financial institutions and other companies is rampant.

"What's ironic is that the private sector has ways of uniquely identifying individuals without using Social Security numbers for marketing," he said.

The Pentagon statements said the military is "acutely aware of the substantial security required to protect personal data," and that Social Security numbers will be used only to "provide a higher degree of accuracy in matching duplicate data records."

The Pentagon said it routinely monitors its vendors to ensure compliance with its security standards.

Krenke said she did not know how much the contract with BeNow was worth, or whether it was bid competitively.

Officials at BeNow did not return several messages seeking comment. The company's Web site does not have a published privacy policy, nor does it list either a chief privacy officer or security officer on its executive team.

According to the Federal Register notice, the data will be open to "those who require the records in the performance of their official duties." It said the data would be protected by passwords.

The system also gives the Pentagon the right, without notifying citizens, to share the data for numerous uses outside the military, including with law enforcement, state tax authorities and Congress.

Some see the program as part of a growing encroachment of government into private lives, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

"It's just typical of how voracious government is when it comes to personal information," said James W. Harper, a privacy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "Defense is an area where government has a legitimate responsibility . . . but there are a lot of data fields they don't need and shouldn't be keeping. Ethnicity strikes me as particularly inappropriate."

Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the Social Security Administration relaxed its privacy policies and provided data on citizens to the FBI in connection with terrorism investigations.

Pre-teen in airport safety breakthrough
By Lucy Sherriff
Published Thursday 23rd June 2005 06:02 GMT

A twelve-year old boy has come up with a gadget that could prevent a re-run of the Concorde crash, by detecting debris on the runway and alerting pilots before they line-up to land. According to the BBC, the British Airport Authority (BAA) is keen to develop the idea.

Daryn Murray from East Kilbride says he was inspired by the Concorde crash in Paris in 2000, where the supersonic plane is thought to have driven over a piece of metal on the runway. The plane subsequently caught fire and crashed, killing 113 people.

His gadget is a remote controlled device with a camera attached. The device would roll along a track, alongside the runway. Murray explains that the device can spot debris "as small as a nut" and warn the pilot that it is not safe to land.

BAA Scotland's engineering director Colin Crichton said that the device could add to the runway inspections process. He told The BBC "Daryn's idea could offer an additional safety measure, and we're keen to speak to him about how he can develop his idea. We'll be inviting him to Glasgow Airport to go behind the scenes and meet the team who safeguard the runway."

David Aitken, Murray's teacher and head of craft, design and technology at Duncanrig Secondary, said that he expected to be in touch with BAA in the future.

Murray developed his gadget as part of the Young Engineers for Britain contest. He wants to be a mechanical engineer when he grows up.

July 1: Sun square Jupiter

Talk about extravagant -- and excessive! The Sun in tenderhearted Cancer will connect with Jupiter, the planet who's famous for blowing everything way out of proportion. Put the two together in a square, the aspect that just about guarantees inflated reactions, and it's easy to see how the pride we take in our family and friends could cause us to react a lot more emotionally now than we ordinarily would. If you find yourself in the position of defending someone you love, and you're a bit more passionate about it than even you know you should be, try to step back and take a breath. You won't be able to do anyone any good if you can't keep a clear head.

Subject: Fourth of July

I don't remember what year it was, but I think I must have been < 6 years
old, because my parents were still together. We were setting off roman
candles in our driveway when the rain clouds we'd been worrying about turned
out to be a thunder and lightening storm. My dad grabbed a blanket and
wrapped us up in it because I didn't want to under the porch because I
wouldn't be able to see the lightening properly there.

The storm passed pretty quickly, and the fireworks were still dry enough to
ignite afterwards.

stormagnet nods

stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think that bulk carrier has a lot of potential, though"
stormagnet says, "I can't wait until we could retrofit them for fuel cell/pebble bed power"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh, and I think freight ships will be much larger than cruise ships"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes, the power source and money are the gating factors."
stormagnet says, "The carrier ships also have that nice long, flat expanse up top which we could try and plantify"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Actually, I think the smart thing to do would be to use grow lights belowdecks"
Crag says, "Hydroponics ala the pot growers"
stormagnet says, "1.4M sounds like an amount we could make on the real estate market by the time we're 70, if we play it smart :)"
Crag says, "That's kinda what I was thinking"
stormagnet says, "I was thinking both"
stormagnet says, "Depending on the plant type"
Crag says, "I thought we'd want to keep the top open for people to play on"

Crag says, "For example, we could setup a beach"
stormagnet says, "I was thinking park like"
stormagnet says, "With an orchard"
Crag says, "That's a good idea too"

stormagnet says, "Unless they were retrofitted to run on something other than oil"

stormagnet says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "Though the tankers could have a park/orchard below decks, possibly"
stormagnet says, "If we were very clever about the lighting"
Crag says, "It remains to be seen if a PBR can be scaled down to fit on a ship"

stormagnet says, "I was thinking fuel cells are a more likely prospect in the meantime"

Crag says, "Oh"

Subject: Not even switched and already asking for time off...
But better to ask sooner, rather than later, right?

There's a summer gathering in California I want to go to around the 12th and 13th of August.  

Would it be reasonable for me to take a couple of weeks off around then?  I've got 48 hours + 2 floating holidays right now, and I was thinking (assuming I can't switch to Sun-Wed) I could take the 11th-13th and 17th-20th off.  I know that's 70 hours, but I'm assuming my floating holidays count as 10 hours when I switch schedules, and that I'll acrue another 2 hours of vacation before then.

If you can't have me out that long, I'd like to try for just the 10th-13th.

If I can switch to Sun-Wed, I'll want the 14th-17th with an optional 8th-10th if possible.

Astrologist sues NASA over comet crash
Tue Jul 5, 2005 09:42 AM ET

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian astrologist who says NASA has altered her horoscope by crashing a spacecraft into a comet is suing the U.S. space agency for damages of $300 million, local media reported Monday.

NASA deliberately crashed its probe, named Deep Impact, into the Tempel 1 comet to unleash a spray of material formed billions of years ago which scientists hope will shed new light on the composition of the solar system.

"It is obvious that elements of the comet's orbit, and correspondingly the ephemeris, will change after the explosion, which interferes with my astrology work and distorts my horoscope," Izvestia daily quoted astrologist Marina Bai as saying in legal documents submitted before Monday's collision.

A spokeswoman for a Moscow district court said initial preparations for the case were underway but could not say when the hearing would begin. NASA representatives in Moscow were unavailable for comment.

Firm aims to turn ash to cash
Tue Jul 5, 2005 09:39 AM ET

DUBLIN (Reuters) - An Irish couple have come up with an idea to turn ash to cash by offering to scatter the cremated remains of foreigners in Ireland.

Ed and Helen O'Neill set up their firm, Ashes to Ireland, after an Irish-American friend asked them to scatter her husband's remains over the Irish Sea.

"When we saw how much it meant to her we realized there was a niche in the market," Helen O'Neill told Reuters Monday.

O'Neill said the response so far had been largely from the United States, where some 40 million claim Irish ancestry, and Britain, where thousands of Irish people sought work during tough economic times at home in the 1940s and 1950s.

"We're hoping to tap into the Australian market as well," she said.

The company arranges for transportation of the ashes and provides the deceased's family with a video of the scattering.

"It can be difficult for older people to travel and since September 11 many Americans are still nervous of crossing the Atlantic," O'Neill said.

The youth's "unusually prominent female features," and heavy make-up drew security guards' attention and they stopped him from taking the test, Yasen Zasursky, dean of Moscow State University's journalism faculty, told the agency.

Crag | Perl is like the perfect butler. Whatever you ask Perl to do, it says ``Very good, sir,'' or ``Very good, madam.'' Only occasionally does Perl give you a stiff upper lip, or say ``Tsk, tsk.'' But if you ask Perl its opinion, it will advise you on matters of taste. ``I'm sorry sir, but bareword 'foo' is not allowed while 'strict subs' is in use.''
Crag | Contrast that with the Modern idea of how a computer should behave. It's really rather patronizing: ``I'm sorry Dave. I can't allow you to do that.''

 Storm, your career personality type is ISFJ

That means that based on the standard measure of personality traits, you are a strong team player and believe the needs of the group come before the individual. You generally care about the people around you, which allows you to provide a personal touch at your workplace. That sense of caring allows you to feel personal accomplishment and acceptance from your co-workers who know they can turn to you for help. You are generous with your time and spirit and look to make the present moment better for everyone.

Your emotional strength combined with a pragmatic approach to work makes you a strong asset. You don't like juggling multiple projects at once and would rather get one project off your desk at a time. Because of your internal value system, you don't need false flattery from others. You have a strong work ethic and inspire others by your example. Because of this, you are a strong leader on any team. To you, your work speaks for itself.

The reason employers and recruiters might be on the lookout for you is that only about 7% of the U.S. population shares the unique characteristics of your personality type. Research shows that businesses succeed when employers create a good balance of personality types in the office. And since only 7% of the U.S. population shares your type, that means employers are looking for you.

But, to truly show employers what you have to offer, you need to understand a little more about traits that make up your type.

The offering combines Napster's digital music service with Dell's PowerEdge 1855 servers that will boost network bandwidth at schools. Colleges will be able to use the servers to store music from Napster's library locally, allowing network processing speed to remain fast while hundreds of students simultaneously download music.

The University of Washington is the first school to sign up for the package, set to launch this fall, the companies said.

New drug blocks HIV from entering cells

07/07/2005
The Asahi Shimbun

A durable new drug that prevents HIV from entering human cells and causes
almost no side effects has been developed by a team of researchers at
Kumamoto University.

The new drug, code named AK602, was reported by the research team's leader,
Hiroaki Mitsuya, at the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the
Pacific in Kobe on Tuesday.

The drug's main feature is that it shuts out the AIDS virus at the point when
it tries to intrude into a human cell.

Current AIDS medicines can lose their effectiveness in a few days when the
virus changes and develops a resistance to those drugs. But AK602 is
different because it reacts to human cells instead of attacking the virus,
Mitsuya said.

He said the drug sticks to a protein called CCR5 that acts as an entrance
into human cells for the AIDS virus. When the new drug becomes attached to
the protein, it can prevent HIV from entering, and thus stop the virus from
spreading.

The researchers conducted clinical tests on 40 AIDS patients in the United
States.

AK602 not only proved effective against viruses that had become resistant to
other drugs, but it also caused almost no side effects, the team
said.(IHT/Asahi: July 7,2005)

Skateboarder jumps China's Great Wall
Mon Jul 11, 2005 09:11 AM ET

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California skateboarder Danny Way jumped over a 61-foot (18.6-meter) gap in the Great Wall of China, becoming the first person to clear the ancient fortification without motorized aid, his sponsor said.

Way then went on to jump the wall three more times on Saturday, taking off from a specially built ramp at the nearly 3,000-year-old Ju Yong Guan Gate, and adding in 360-degree spins as spectators looked on.

"I was aware of the dangers and my heart was pumping in my chest the whole time, but I managed to pull it off with the help of my team, and I'm honored to have my visions embraced by the people of China," Way said in a statement.

Way, of Carlsbad, California, was sponsored by Quiksilver Inc., which makes skateboard apparel.

Others have tried to jump the Great Wall before. In 2002, Wang Jiaxiong, a mountain biker, fractured his skull and died after overshooting his planned landing area. Way was the first person to try the jump on a skateboard.

Way already holds the world records for distance jumped by skateboard and for height at 79 feet and 23.5 feet, respectively.
