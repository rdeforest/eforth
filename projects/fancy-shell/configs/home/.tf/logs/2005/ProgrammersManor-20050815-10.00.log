stormagnet has connected.
stormagnet says, "Wow, Martha'as going to HAVE to come up soon for more sushi"
stormagnet says, "As we forgot to give her the title and the key"
Crag on phone w/ international
stormagnet nods
Crag laughs and laughs
Crag says, "I was on the phone with Dave from international again"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "It was a lot of fun"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "He was saying stuff like, 'Please tell me that's documented...'"
Crag says, "And I would pause"
stormagnet snorts
Crag says, "And I would say"
Crag says, "Sure.  Sure Dave.  It's documented."
Crag says, "I'll tell you whatever you want to hear"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "And then I'd laugh"
Crag says, "and he would groan"
Crag says, "It was a lot of fun"
Crag says, "I like Dave a lot :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "SO"
Crag says, "Yeah, Martha"
stormagnet says, "The kitty did indeed come out last night at some point"
Crag says, "She found a spare key, so the emergency is under control"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet cheers
stormagnet says, "Excellent"
Crag says, "How is she?"
stormagnet says, "The clams have been devoured, as has the water"
stormagnet says, "AND some of the dry food"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "good kitty"
stormagnet says, "AND"
stormagnet says, "I'm not positive"
stormagnet says, "But I think the scratch pattern in the litter box has changed :)"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That would be excellent news indeed."
Crag says, "She's gonna have to go potty eventually"
stormagnet says, "She's not under the record player OR the futon"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "wow!"
stormagnet was worried
Crag says, "Where is she?"
stormagnet says, "I think she's hiding under the armchair"
Crag says, "Ah, ok"
stormagnet says, "But I haven't checked yet"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Of course"
Crag says, "You don't want to disturb her"
Crag says, "poor kitty!"
stormagnet says, "If I weren't worried about making her MORE anxious, I would enjoy playing kitty hide-and-seek"
stormagnet nods
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Oh, the dentist called to remind me about the appointment tomorrow at 4"
Crag says, "so I set an alarm in my phone"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet had forgotten. Entirely.
Crag too
Crag says, "ANyway, Martha wants to sign the Truck directly over to Jessica, but I don't think that affects us.  I think I just have to sign the title and give it to her."
Crag says, "Oh, and send the release into the DMV"
Crag says, "or whatevery the call it up here"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Still, better a sushi handoff than a postal one"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet puts Sancho, in the bedroom, and then makes tea :P
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "No band practice tomorrow."
Crag says, "But we will be on for Thursday."
Crag says, "And 99 jam on Wednesday"

Makai Kingdom

It's a Nippon Ichi game. If that means something to you, you will probably
like this one. It's sort of the Phantom Brave system with more of a Disgaea
storyline, plus you can drive around in vehicles and summon buildings into
the middle of a fight.

I've been having fun with it so far.

stormagnet says, "nay?"
Crag says, "It appears that the temperature threshold is binary.  The units turn on when the temperature rises above it and off when it's below"
Crag says, "And the margin of error thing is just that."
Crag says, "If the margin of error is 2 degrees and the temperature threshold is 70, the unit turns on at 72 degrees"
Crag says, "pretty lame"
stormagnet wants a PS2 more than ever, now
Crag says, "The only reason they have the threshold is that it applies to low and high temp errors too"
Crag laughs
Crag reads
stormagnet says, "WTF is the point, then?"
Crag says, "It's a 'how well do we trust the temperatuer sensor' setting"
stormagnet growls
Crag says, "I think it's retarded"
Crag says, "But whatever"
stormagnet says, "IT IS"
Crag says, "I'm still tinkering with the settings looking for something stable"
stormagnet says, "KLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDGE!"
Crag says, "One unit by itself can't keep up with the load."

Summon buildings?  Like Dorothy Gale or more like Tom Baker?

A little of both. Buildings come down from the sky and they can crush things,
but at the same time, they hold many, many characters.
