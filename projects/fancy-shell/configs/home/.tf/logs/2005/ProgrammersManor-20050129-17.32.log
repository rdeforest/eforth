enceladus giggles.
Crag says, "Trying to get client-side editing working"
Crag says, "Then I'm going to document the MOO theme on this note."
Crag says, "Then I'll figure out how to turn it into 'help theme'"
enceladus says, "coolness"
Crag says, "This core is a WaterPoint extraction, so you'll have some adjusting to do if you're used to LambdaCore"
enceladus says, "coding still the same?"
Crag says, "Mostly"
Crag says, "The differences are in the core objects"
Crag says, "And integration is more complete"
Crag says, "If you set the @integrate_room message on an object it will integrate into the room it's in"
Crag says, "As part of the core, not as an extension"
Crag says, "Hence no 'details' system"
