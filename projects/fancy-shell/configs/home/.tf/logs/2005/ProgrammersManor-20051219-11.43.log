stormagnet has connected.
stormagnet says, "Howdy"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Haw!"
Crag says, "How's the wiring?"
stormagnet says, "Looking good"
stormagnet says, "Got a bunch of outlets grounded"
stormagnet says, "He didn't end up needing to run cable to the outlets to ground them, though, so we didn't run ethernet"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "Last night, I decided to go ahead and order my tablet"
stormagnet says, "Because there was a big sale on them"
stormagnet says, "AND part of that promotion was getting a free wireless router to go with it"
stormagnet says, "So running ethernet to the different rooms may become less of a priority, depending on how that works out"
stormagnet says, "ALSO"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet says, "Chatted with the electrician a bit"
stormagnet says, "He's into astrology, AND interested in running Linux"
Crag lol
Crag says, "Awesome"
stormagnet says, "I mentioned that you might be amenable to barter :)"
Crag says, "Totally!"
Crag says, "Or just having astrology parties"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Hey, I like that idea.  Astrology parties."
stormagnet says, "I should warn you, he's more Gemini Than Gemini, apparently"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's ok"
stormagnet says, "Sun, Moon, Rising, Jupiter..."
Crag says, "Even though they drive me nuts, I still like them"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "They're just the most frustrating for me"
Crag says, "But it's cute"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "It's kinda like how I like Scorpios even though I know I shouldn't"
stormagnet says, "Man, I can't wait for my tablet to arrive now"
stormagnet says, "It also got free 2-day shipping"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet wants to get it all set up and tweaked in time for school
Crag grins.
Crag says, "At the very least you'll have two machines so your workstation can't hold you hostage on its own"
Crag says, "They'd have to go on strike to leave you out in the cold"
Crag says, "I don't think most computers form unions like that."
Crag says, "And once you're situationed on the tablet you or I could rebuild your Amd64 machine towards some other goal than being your primary workstation."
Crag says, "If we wanted."
Crag says, "Did you get a docking station for the tablet?"
stormagnet says, "YAYS!"
stormagnet says, "No, I decided not to buy a docking station just yet, because I don't think I'll really need one"
Crag says, "How much would it have been?"
stormagnet says, "A couple hundred bucks"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "That's pretty good"
stormagnet says, "I could buy one later, if I find myself wanting one"
Crag says, "I suppose"
Crag says, "On the one hand you could work from both machines using subversion for document sharing"
stormagnet says, "It already has plenty of ports built in"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But what about plugging and unplugging them all the time?"
Crag says, "That's on the other hand"
Crag says, "AND with a dock you'd free up the desktop for entirely different purposes"
Crag rubs his hands together with glee
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "Okay, I see your point"
Crag says, "It could wait though"
stormagnet says, "I was having a bit of a panicky reaction to spending so much money"
stormagnet says, "Which is why it took me so long to come to bed"
stormagnet says, "I knew logically that it was right and necessary and all that"
stormagnet says, "But still"
stormagnet will feel better once she has her precious in her hands, so that she might love it and stroke it
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag says, "I know exactly what you mean about the money"
Crag says, "I felt the same way about your current navi and ildana"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet hugs!!
stormagnet says, "OH YOU RATFUCKERS"
stormagnet calls BofA to remind them, YET AGAIN, that she ALREADY W
stormagnet says, "ALREADY WARNED THEM I'D BE SPENDING A LOT"
stormagnet says, "My order status says "Pending credit card authorization""
stormagnet says, "I'm going to take a WILD GUESS and say they put a hold on my card AGAIN"
stormagnet says, "This will have delayed my having my precious in hand by a whole 24 hours!!"
stormagnet says, "BASTARDS"
Crag says, "I bet if we ever did experience any credit card fraud BofA wouldn't catch it"
Crag says, "ANd they wouldn't believe us when we reported it"
stormagnet NODS
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "I forgot to mention"
Crag listens attentively
stormagnet says, "THe electrician also grounded another outlet for us for free :)"
stormagnet says, "So we have two grounded outlets in the computer room"
stormagnet says, "Our geek factor seems to be helping us considerably with electricians"
stormagnet says, "Okay, BofA aren't COMPLETE ratfuckers"
stormagnet says, "Toshiba must just be backed up"
stormagnet wants it NOWNOWNOWNOWNOW
stormagnet says, "I choked out an extra $359.10 for a 4-year uber-warranty, too"
stormagnet says, "The kind that essentially says, "If you THROW YOUR COMPUTER UNDER A TRUCK, we will STILL fix or replace it.""
stormagnet says, "Ie. "Accidental damage" is included"
stormagnet says, "And I'm pondering getting one of those laptop insurance plans, where they agree to replace it if it's stolen"
stormagnet says, "Though slapping stickers all over it and having a jewler etch it's serial number and my name on the side may accomplish much the same"
stormagnet says, "ITS, not it's"
Crag grinsd.
Crag says, "st00pid keyboard"
Crag says, "I miss my happy hacker when I'm at work"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet says, "I also got one of those Super Adaptors"
Crag says, "Wow, 4 years is a long time"
stormagnet says, "For charging it on plane, train, or authomobile :)"
Crag says, "Nice"
stormagnet says, "It *might* work on yours, too"
stormagnet says, "It *claims* to be universal"
Crag says, "I could ask for one from work if I thought I needed it"
stormagnet . o O ( I'm typo lisping! )
stormagnet . o O ( lithping? )
stormagnet . o O ( thypo? )
Crag says, "An authomobile is a vehical for authenticators"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Sweet, WinXP Tablet just needs a free service pack install to do Japanese handwriting recognition"
stormagnet says, "And I know how to get keyboard input working in Linux"
stormagnet says, "So that bodes well for a speedy setup"
Crag says, "I'm OUTA HEE-UH!"
Crag says, "Annnnnd... I'm back."
stormagnet awakes
stormagnet says, "Did you feed the cats before leaving?"
stormagnet says, "They're trying to convince me that yuo didn't, but there was a little food left in their dishes"
stormagnet says, "Which is usually a sign you did"
stormagnet says, "Aw, poor Don, he caught a cold"
stormagnet says, "The electrician, that is"
stormagnet says, "Hmm"
stormagnet says, "I have some kind of funky blister in the back of my mouth, next to where the worst of the dry socket was"
stormagnet says, "It doesn't hurt, though the jaw around it is a bit tender"
stormagnet says, "Maybe I had better call and mention this to the oral surgeon guys"
stormagnet has a stupid superstition that if she doesn't, it will go away on its own, but is learning
Crag says, "She's awake!"
Crag says, "Awesome!"
Crag says, "I did not feed the cats"
Crag says, "Interestingly enough, they didn't make much of an effort to get me to feed them this morning"
stormagnet feeds them, then
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "Not to be insensitive, but if our finances and credit would supoprt it, how would you feel about buying the house north of ours when the widdow moves out or passes away?"
Crag says, "I was thinking it would be genious to be so close to The Sanctuary to make managing it as a rental easier"
Crag says, "Would make it harder for our tenants to misbehave and not get caught."
stormagnet says, "It would be an excellent idea, though our finances/credit wouldn't support it until I graduate and get a job ^_^;;"
stormagnet feeds the electrician medicinal tea
Crag says, "I'm expecting that she will be there that long."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "I wonder though"
Crag says, "If we're able to condense our first mortgage into one loan, and the house value makes it to 400k, and our credit continues to improve, we might be ready sooner than we think."
Crag says, "I think I am going to go on a book-buying spree next year"
Crag says, "Starting with personal improvement, finances, communication, family, leadership, work, justice, economics, philosophy, business development, and then spirituality. :)"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll start at the equinox, and buy and read a book a month, themed by the sign the sun is in at the time"
Crag says, "Better yet, I'll start with astrology right away, and then go through the cycle starting in spring."
stormagnet says, "THat sounds like an awesome idea"
stormagnet says, "I'm afraid the electrician has made holes where he oughtn't"
stormagnet o_O
stormagnet hears the electrician say, "Oops- pipe...
stormagnet hears him say, "Ooops- there's another..."
stormagnet will now need to learn the arcane art of Drywall Patching
stormagnet has, however, finished making an AWESOME gingerbread house
stormagnet says, "It won't be winning any awards, or anything, but for a first try, it's pretty impressive"
Crag says, "Not a very confidence-inspiring electrician..."
stormagnet says, "Aheh"
stormagnet says, "I did some GIMP-foo on that WDIG party picture"
stormagnet says, "I'm rather pleased with the comparison"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "/home/stormagnet/docs/images/raine/wdig_xmas_party_05*"
stormagnet says, "I really need to learn how to use that digital camera better"
stormagnet says, "Check the exposure settings and flash and all before taking pictures"
stormagnet says, "My gingerbread house is nearly blinding when I use flash"
stormagnet @_@
stormagnet <- BLINDED!
Crag back
Crag peers
Crag says, "I'd be happy to tell you what little I've learned about using that camera"
Crag says, "The frog would have come out much better if I'd had a tripod."
Crag says, "But who brings a tripod to a xmas party"
Crag says, "besides seanb"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I put pictures of the completed gingerbread house up on my Flickr page"
stormagnet says, "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stormagnet/"
Crag says, "Hoo ha!"
Crag says, "That's a lot of icing"
Crag says, "Looks delicious"
Crag says, "I like the Marco picture, too"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I just noticed that my chipmonk-cheek totally shows in that picture from the WDIG party"
stormagnet says, "This amuses me :)"
Crag smiles.
Crag says, "I think it's quite a flattering picture."
stormagnet says, "I think so too, thus my amusement :)"
stormagnet says, "It gives it a sort of optical illusion affect- am I sucking my cheeks in or puffing them out?"
stormagnet says, "FuckityfuckityfuckingHELL"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "You'll be fine"
Crag hugs
Crag says, "Dangit, it's been so busy at work that I haven't been able to catch up on my goofing off"
Crag sighs overly-dramatically
Crag says, "According to astrolog Pluto is "destiny, and capacity to transform the self and the outer world.""
Crag says, "You've got to major aspects with Pluto next year"
stormagnet says, "Yeep"
stormagnet says, "Electrician left early, when he came to the conclusion that he was just too sick to be competant today"
stormagnet says, "I can sympathize, though I kind of wish he'd figured that out BEFORE putting holes in places they oughtn't be"
stormagnet says, "Campbell-Nelson finally called"
stormagnet says, "Tires are ~$400 installed, for nice all-weather ones"
stormagnet says, "I told them to go for it"
stormagnet says, "And they said it *should* be done tomorrow"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "That sounds about right to me"
Crag says, "I was paying $80/tire in '98"
Crag says, "Or maybe it was 99 or 2000, I'm not sure"
Crag says, "But yeah"
Crag says, "I might be home late tonight"
Crag says, "The next shift hasn't shown up yet"
Crag says, "Yay, Oliver's here"
Crag says, "I'll be leaving in about 10 minutes or so"
Crag says, "But with traffic I probably won't be home until 5:15 or so"

[Idling at 4:06 P.M. on Tue, Dec 20: real life intrusion]
stormagnet says, "OH NOES"
stormagnet says, "You forgot the curry!!"
Crag says, "DAMMIT"
Crag nods and sighs.
Crag says, "Definitely need to increase my dose"
Crag says, "I did look to see if there was lunch, but didn't see the purple bag in their, so I just took off"
Crag says, "oh well"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet couldn't fit it in the bag
stormagnet says, "Does James work Thursday?"
Crag says, "Yeah..."
Crag says, "I could bring it to him tomorrow"
Crag says, "I'll do that."
Crag says, "I need to do stuff anyway"
Crag says, "I wonder if we'll get Zippo back tonight"
Crag says, "Poor Zippo"
Crag says, "next version of ssh does layer 2 tunnelling"
Crag says, "We could setup a VPN with Daniel where his machines appear to be on the same physical ethernet"
Crag says, "Not that there's much reason to, but we could."
stormagnet says, "Of course there's a reason to!"
stormagnet says, "1337 CRED!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Maybe we'll have a user for a such a tunnel by the time the new version makes it to Debian"
[the Dinner Menu]
Note erased.
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "Use"
Crag says, "Oops"
Crag says, "I accidentally erased the dinner menu"
Crag says, "I typed Er without the leading double quote"
Crag says, "And it erased the note"
Crag says, "That's probably bad UI design"
It appears to be blank.
Crag says, "I guess I might as well recycle it now"
Sure you want to recycle the Dinner Menu (#1165)? [Enter `yes' or `no']
The Dinner Menu (#1165) recycled.
stormagnet says, "THat's okay, I hadn't been updating it anyway :)"
stormagnet says, "I really need to start getting more organized about dinner, though"
stormagnet says, "Otherwise I'm just going to start skipping meals and eating junk after school starts"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "You probably already saw this, but"
stormagnet | http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4545252.stm
stormagnet says, "SO COOL"
stormagnet says, "Erm"
stormagnet says, "AND BAD TOO"
stormagnet says, "DAMMIT"
stormagnet . o O ( why must you people use your powers for evil?! )
stormagnet says, "OMFG, they did NOT just try and paint the predominent public concern as tin-foil-hatted fear of 'radio waves'..."
stormagnet says, "MOTHERFUCKERS"
Crag peers
Crag says, "I hadn't seen that.  Interesting."
stormagnet | http://bbspot.com/News/2000/4/MS_Buys_Evil.html
stormagnet | http://www.flamingmailbox.com/maccomedy/movies/balmer.html
stormagnet says, "OMG that just cracked my ass up"
Crag says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "Found those on Bill Amends webpage"
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "So, given that add/drop options are freely available during the first week of the quarter, I've just registered for my last back-up option"
stormagnet says, "ASIAN 207, "Special Topics In Asian Literature""
stormagnet says, "The topic this time?"
stormagnet says, "Martial arts flicks"
stormagnet says, "Watch and discuss"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "I don't think there's such a THING as a more guaranteed dumb-fun 4.0 than that class"
stormagnet | http://www.washington.edu/students/icd/S/asianll/207jcsong.html
stormagnet howls with laughter at the discription of assignments
stormagnet says, "THere's not even an essay component!"
stormagnet says, "Sweet jesus"
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "There isn't even an attendance requirement- it's 'strongly advised'"
stormagnet | http://faculty.washington.edu/yomi/272martialarts.html
stormagnet says, "And I've ALREADY SENN 4 of the films listed"
stormagnet says, "SEEN"
stormagnet . o O ( looks like I'm going to have a regularly scheduled naptime -_-zzzz )
stormagnet says, "The really, horribly ironic part of it is"
stormagnet says, "This is the only course listed as counting towards my major that was still open"
stormagnet says, "I think I can wrangle getting the other two included, since their curriculum is roughly equivalent to some of the classes listed on the Japanese Major page"
stormagnet says, "But COME ON"
stormagnet says, "Even if a slot opens up in Japanese 212 or Japanese Lit II, I may keep this one"
stormagnet says, "If they'll let me register for 20+ credits at a time, I can certainly handle them"
stormagnet says, "My schedule would STILL be more open than it was at Evergreen"
stormagnet says, "Evergreen- Twice the work, None of the Respect!"
stormagnet says, "Sweet- 20 credits is the cap"

stormagnet chalks up one more point for our side
stormagnet says, "OMFG!!!"
stormagnet says, "Berkeley brute-forced Schrodinger!"
stormagnet | http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051219091459.htm
Crag says, "holy cow"
Crag says, "I was away from the MOO for a meeting"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet <- Queen of Scroll
Crag says, "I wonder what it would take to scale up the university to accomodate more students."
Crag says, "I just added sciencedaily.com/scripts/* to my adblock."
Crag says, "This auto linking fad better go away soon"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet | http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051219235445.htm
stormagnet says, "HA"
stormagnet WINS
Crag says, "Oh good lord, there's tons of scripts"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Heh, yay booze"
stormagnet says, "It's a Christmas Miracle!"
Crag snorts
stormagnet | http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051220085054.htm
stormagnet says, "ohshit"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Woof"
Crag says, "I just sent Allison my weekly status report, and my "In Progress" section has grown significantly"
Crag says, "I think you're right about the Adderall"
Crag says, "In that I couldn't tell when I was out of sync before, so I can't tell if it's working now since I don't even know what it would be like for it to be working"
Crag says, "And even though I believe that I did more in the other group, I feel like the work I'm doing now is better structured and more effective."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That sounds like the ideal effect, all right"
Crag says, "I keep having doubts, and then something like this comes along and reassures me"
Crag says, "I clearly have a long way to go, but I can't deny that the direction I'm going now is closer to the ideal than the direction I was going two months ago."
Crag says, "And as far as I'm concerned, the question of whether it's the drug, my own will, or the movement of the planets at work is silly.  The answer is both yes and no."
Crag says, "And also 'mu'"
Crag says, "Scientifically, the drug has a strong likelyhood of being helpful given the data I have"
Crag says, "So I will stick with it"
Crag says, "Philosophically, it may be that beginning therapy corresponds to my progressed sun opposing natal uranus, or I could just be rationalizing."
Crag says, "But it doesn't hurt me any to make the correlation, and it wouldn't help not to."
Crag says, "So I'm sticking with that too (and how)"
Crag says, "And as far as my will goes, there's no way of knowing if my will is an illusion, so it's not worth evaluating its role in this story."
stormagnet says, "Precisely"
Crag smiles.
stormagnet says, "All Climate has our new windows and will be installing them next Tuesday :)"
Crag says, "excellent"
stormagnet says, "Okay, electrician is wrapping up for the day, so I'm going to try and squeeze in a shower before the surgeons appointment"
Crag says, "Fair enough"
Crag says, "I'll see you when I get home"
Crag hugs
