NEWS FLASH:

The kitty was NOT under the armchair, ut wedged into the tiny, disty,
spiderwebby crack between the wall and that water heater. Kitty then seemed
to reconsider this arrangement, and decided to come out and be petted.

A LOT. TWENTY MINUTES WORTH, IN FACT.

Kitty then retired under the futon, a far more comfy hiding spot. However,
the petting was thorough enough that I now retract my previous guess at
gender- those looked suspiciously like balls, to me.

I am concerned, though. There was a sort of bubbly, sniffly sound to the
purring. I think I'll reconsider delaying the vet visit.

Crag says, "So they're crazy."
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "I just can't win"
Crag says, "So the 'short cycle' alarm goes off when the unit has turned and off 10 times in an hour."
Crag says, "To clear it I actually have to shut the thing down completely, not just from the control panel."
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
Crag says, "Or, I can shut it down from the control panel and wait an hour"
Crag says, "Or I can change the severity of the warning to make it not a 'common alarm'"

Crag says, "Ah, the A/C units have four rates of heat removal"
Crag says, "they're not simply on/off"

We've got more happy news around here: Yasu's daughter was born this morning, a
strong and healthy baby girl named Riko-chan. In Japan, babies are usually born
in small "maternity hospitals" that only deliver babies, rather than maternity
wards of large hospitals. There are several of these clinics in each city, and
competition between them can be quite fierce -- the place where our children
were born lured us with full-course French cuisine for my wife while she was
recuperating, and a complimentary video featuring Ultrasound footage of each of
our kids as they grew in utero, and of us holding them after they were born.
Japan has a lot of strong beliefs about childbirth -- I might use the word
"superstitions" but my wife would get mad at me. For example, for the first week
after giving birth a woman is not allowed to touch water at all or it will make
her blood boil (or something like that). I remember my mother-in-law bustling
around the house making sure the dishes and laundry were done so my wife didn't
have to worry herself with it.

stormagnet LAUGHS
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
If Proportional Control is selected, the % requirement is determined by the difference between the
return air temperature and the temperature setpoint. As the return air temperature rises above the
temperature setpoint, the % cooling required increases proportionally (from 0 to 100%) over a temperature
band equal to the temperature sensitivity +10F. The % heating requirement is determined the
same way as the temperature decreases below the setpoint. With this type of control the temperature
at which the room is controlled increases as the room cooling load increases. At full cooling load, the
room would be controlled at a temperature equal to the setpoint plus the sensitivity.

Crag says, "The contractors said it wouldn't be a problem, but they were wrong."
Crag says, "crap like that really irks me, as you know."
Crag says, "I don't understand why these units have their air intakes close to the floor where the air is normally cool."
Crag says, "They should be running the other way around.  Exhausting cool air up from the floor and sucking hot air off the top"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag says, "CRAP"
Crag says, "it's 3:20"
Crag says, "Well, I guess I'll try the new windows build procedure tomorrow."
Crag says, "I did close a couple of vents in the datacenter and the temperature graph on the A/C units has smoothed out quite a bit."
Crag says, "I think a lot of the futzing around I did was nearly a complete waste of time."
Crag says, "oh well"

Crag says, "yes.  The lesson is, read the manual as soon as possible"

That forward? I got it. I've gotten it. I do not wish to keep receiving it. I
was neither moved nor inspired. It was neither clever nor funny. I was not
amazed at the stupidity of that criminal, nor disgusted, appalled, and
chagrined by the United States Government. I do not marvel at how inexpensive
things used to be, nor am I astonished that kids today don't know about
things that happened before they were born.

The photo? I had that, too. I have seen two children of any given ethnicity
holding hands. I have seen fat ladies in thongs. I saw the bungee jumper crap
his pants and I have seen adults covering themselves or others with vomit,
urine, and/or beer in any conceivable arrangment with which you would want to
provide me. I have no concern for what you consider to be worthy of a
MasterCard "Priceless" parody. Intoxication does not amuse me.

I will not be starting or stopping the consumption of any product or service
due to the information you provided me in your forwarded email. I will not be
winning any contest nor will I submit any data for market research. I will
not be subverting AOL, Microsoft, Disney, the IRS or any other entity through
the continued transmittal of your bogus message. I boycott your boycotts.

I will not sign up for whatever affiliate program you've got in your email
signature. I do not marvel at The Way Things Used to Be. Change your homepage
to snopes.com.

I do not care about your heart-warming bullshit, for I am a stone and my
heart is cold. Genuine friendships are characterized by emails that are
written and sent for me and to me. I do not want to be made aware you were
thinking of me, I will not stop to smell the flowers, I will not count my
blessings, and I live in neither the best nor the worst country on Earth.
Jesus and I have a policy of mutual apathy toward one another. That kitten is
not cute. Your baby is not the first to walk, talk, or use a toilet. God is a
hoax.

My answer to your questionnaire is: No. My favorite color is: No. My favorite
song is: No. I do not care what tree, dog, fruit, Power Ranger or member of
the Mos Eisley Cantina Band I most resemble. There Is No All Your Base. I
have seen the End of the Internet page, and that wasn't funny last time,
either. I find recitations of "lookit how funny those foreigners are!"
xenophobic, trite and tiring.

I think I'm done now. Please attribute this to Dave Barry and Kurt Vonnegut
and then forward this to everyone in your address book.

a filesystem (of the given type) found on the device.
One can also mount an already visible directory tree elsewhere:
