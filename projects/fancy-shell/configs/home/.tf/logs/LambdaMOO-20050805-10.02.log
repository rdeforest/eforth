Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Ah. Bug in :say_action

21:  if (who == dobj)
22:    tell = this:reflexive(msg, "%d");
23:  endif
24:  if (who == iobj)
25:    tell = this:reflexive(msg, "%i");
26:  endif

should be:

21:  if (who == dobj)
22:    tell = this:reflexive(tell, "%d");
23:  endif
24:  if (who == iobj)
25:    tell = this:reflexive(tell, "%i");
26:  endif

Thanks for spotting this.

The two examples given where a subject pronoun is mistaken for an object pronoun ("...bonk yourself.  Yourself say.." and "Itself collapses to the ground") would both be handled by not doing the substitution on %D or %I.  I don't think %D or %I would ever be object pronouns, though I'm sure someone will correct me...

I've made this change on #67923, although I realise I've opened a bit of a can of worms here. Consider: 

  "%N %<thinks> %d %<d:likes> %i."

If dobj == player then you get:

  "You think yourself like <someone>."

If iobj == player, you get:

  "You think <someone> likes yourself."

Really there's no way to solve this without a lot of complicated parsing. I guess we just pick the most convenient set of tricks, and if they don't work for your particular output, then you don't get to use :say_action().

I'm in favor of restoring the old code, and putting the new code in something like :say_action_reflexive so it's available without breaking previous stuff.

OK, $you adjusted:  say_action -> say_action_reflexive; say_action(old) -> say_action.

There seems to be a problem. $you:say_action is not the original code. It doesn't even have the help messages it used to have.

Huh.  I thought I did @copy originally and then @copy back.  I've rebooted my machine since then so I can't check scrollback.  If you have a copy of the original, I'd be happy to reinstall.

I grabbed a copy from YibMOO (and removed YibMOO-specific waif stuff) and put it on myself: #110777:say_action    (Note: the verb won't work because it tries to call me:fixpos, which doesn't exist. However, the verb will work fine when placed on $you.)

So that is identical (except for the @copy line) to the one we already have.  I removed the @copy line from $you:say_action.  But it was already OK...

Oops, I thought I saw more difference than just the help text. Sorry if I got anyone riled up.  :)

Well, not a core issue, but FYI I'll be on vacation til August 8.  May or may not login while I'm gone.  Is there a forum I should post this info on so everyone who needs to know will get it?  Beats me.
