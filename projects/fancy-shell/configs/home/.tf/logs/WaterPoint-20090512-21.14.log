The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is chilly.  The coastal path continues to the south and northwest.
You see a quicksilver pez here.

The Living Room
Wayne and Marn are sitting in the large bay window in the southern wall.  Darkness rests like a blanket on the quiet harbor.
pj, Ford, James, and Robby are sitting in the aging navy blue couch occupying much of the east wall.  Jim is sitting in the rocking chair in the corner.
A penguin named Bob is here.  stucky and Matthew are sitting on him.  A folding chair is here.  An impossibly large yet portable amphibious weatherproof couch is here.  Mordred is sitting on it.  Llyrica is sitting on a beach blanket.  A giant pink inflatable chair is here.  Charkes and Rachelle are sitting on it.  A Japanese cartoon towel is here.  An impossibly large yet portable ambiguous weatherproof couch is here.  An A-Team beach towel is here.  A dune buggy is parked here.  Someone's canvas camp chair is here.  A blue folding chair is here.  rgm is sitting on it.
You see an oily spot, a theremin, a box of silly hats, a tactical computer, the rules for the Rack-O! game, a salt shaker, a Project Euler folder, the sequence guesser, a dictionary bookshelf, a Weather Trophy, Urban Dictionary, the KoL boy, a bucket, a stock boy, the URL trap, a gold pezbuster, a candied apple, a pet rock, a homeland security monitor, a kraken box, a jukebox, a fetcher, Abby, a horn of plenty, and a supersoaker here.
Wayne is here.  Ragnar is distracted.  uwiz and Kenny are daydreaming.  Marn, Barry, and Becky are idling.  Robby, keith, Chris, Ben, pj, and Ken are dozing.  Mordred, rgm, Ford, Dea, Llyrica, stucky, Atwood, James, Rachelle, Jim, Charkes, Matthew, Eclipse, Jehk, Kyle, and Roy are off in another world.
Crag has arrived.
Crag says, "wow, so many old-school MOOers are still around.  That's awesome."

Crag says, "I'm getting kinda choked up reading @who"
Ragnar says, "you shoudl see a doctor"
Crag says, "You think it's hamthrax?"
The packrat scurries over from the hallway.
The packrat drops a Jack O' Lantern.
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure the aporkalypse is over"
uwiz says, "E169??"
The packrat scurries north.
You haven't specified which "jack" you mean.
