stormagnet says, "NO, REALLY?!"
stormagnet is SHOCKED
stormagnet says, "I just had a thought on the subject of fault-tolerant social systems"
stormagnet says, "Consider the Papacy"
stormagnet says, "Guy's supposed to be in infallible voice of God, but is elected by the Cardinals, right?"
stormagnet says, "One could considerthat an attempt to build fault tolerance into Church dogma"
stormagnet says, "Only it didn't sufficiently account for forking"
stormagnet says, "At it's inception, it was the ONLY kind of Christianity"
stormagnet typos up a storm, gah!
stormagnet says, "I wonder- if the papacy were more flexible, would it have splintered the way it did?"
stormagnet says, "Probably"
stormagnet says, "After all, they split on issues where a compromise couldn't be found"
stormagnet says, "Such as the willingness to compromise in the first place :P"
stormagnet says, "But considering the Catholic church today, it seems like this is PRECISELY what that whole divine mandate etc was supposed to be for"
stormagnet says, "Only, Catholicism has gone uber conservative"
stormagnet says, "And most progressives have splintered off, like the Episcopalians"
stormagnet says, "But it's definitely an example worth consideration"
stormagnet says, "People's obsession with orthodoxy seems to be a real problem"
stormagnet says, "That change = perversion"
stormagnet says, "And bam! You end up with 'fundamentalists'"
stormagnet says, "Who, as a general rule, are complete crap at the ACTUAL fundamentals"
Crag says, "Ok..."
Crag says, "So you're saying the churche's approach to fault tolerance was rigidity, and that led to forking/dillution of the followers?"
Crag heh, 'churche' - the fancy church
Crag says, "We need to delve into the whole subject of fault-tolerance in social systems"
Crag says, "What faults are we tolerating?  What constitutes a system?  all that stuff"
Crag says, "I think we already have answers, but I'd like to formalize the context"
Crag says, "This would be good stuff to hash out on the wiki"
Crag says, "I don't want to be at work!"
Crag boo hoo
Crag says, "That URL crashes my firefox"
Crag says, "Seattle times WOULD be free-software antagonistic"
Crag says, "Could be a fun walk"
stormagnet blinks
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "but I'M reading it in Firefox?"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Must be something wrong with my machine then"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet is no stranger to weird browser issues, after all
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "It could have been one of those random crashes I've been having trouble with"
stormagnet says, "Though come to think of it..."
Crag says, "So ftss (fault tolerant social systems)..."
stormagnet says, "I wonder if aggressive caching has something to do with it?"
Crag says, "dunno"
Crag says, "So a social system is several things"
Crag says, "It's a collection of protocols"
Crag says, "It's a value system (in theory)"
stormagnet says, "With Catholicism, I was saying that when the Church was founded, there was a clear effort at adding fault tolerance to church doctrine"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "well yeah"
Crag says, "I agree, though my grasp of the history is weak"
stormagnet says, "There were places where it failed, and places where it COULD succeed, if it weren't overrun with fundamentalists"
Crag says, "It almost seems like a social organism has the same challanges as a cellular organism"
stormagnet says, "The association of church and state led to major problems that caused the original fractures"
stormagnet says, "Corruption, etc"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "I think absolute power concentrated in an elected leader is an attempt to maintain integrity"
stormagnet says, "The problem with some systems is that they have apoptosis, but no real evolution"
Crag says, "TO define and protect the boundary of the organism"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So"
Crag says, "How important is social identity to the functioning of the organism?"
Crag says, "Does the organism need to have nationalism or faith or pride?"
Crag says, "Or can it function without those emotional hooks?"
Crag says, "And if they are helpful hooks, how does one keep them from being corrupted?"
Crag says, "Obviously hometown advantage is a powerful tool for motivating strength from within"
Crag says, "But it is also obviously easy to turn towards goals which aren't necessarily in line with the organism's best interests"
Crag says, "More exactly, a corrupting force may try to cash-in the organism's power"
Crag says, "Converting long-term energy into short-term energy for their own use"
Crag says, "And things like emotional hooks are often an easy way to push that angle"
Crag says, "There's also the question of linguistics in social organisms"
stormagnet says, "Hang on"
Crag says, "heh, sure"
Crag says, "I was totally rambling :)"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I just couldn't wait on this one"

Fetal Tissue Heals Burns
Tests Show Treatment Led to Normal Skin Regrowth

By David Brown
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, August 18, 2005; Page A02

An experimental therapy that uses skin cells grown from an aborted fetus successfully healed severe burns in eight children, sparing them the need for skin grafts, according to a study published today.

stormagnet says, "WON'T SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN?!"
Crag says, "excellent"
Crag heh
Crag says, "I'd like to organize the stuff we're talking about on index cards or something, I think"
Crag says, "There are a lot of factors at play here and I'm having a hard time keeping my thoughts straight"
Crag says, "But I'm very excited about the implications"
stormagnet says, "PUT IT ON THE WIKI!"
stormagnet whuggles the Horde
Crag says, "I don't want to log in to the wiki remotely until I have ssl setup"
stormagnet wants to rub her face all over it, just like a cat
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "PUT YOUR FACE IN THE WIKI!!!"
Crag says, "AND NAILS!"
Crag says, "I think what we should do is talk about all of the social systems we know about, what they did for their members and for themselves, where they went right, where they went wrong..."
Crag says, "And then start sketching our ideal system"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Maybe do it XP style"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Write stories about the ideal social system"
Crag says, "And then tests which would determine whether we had one or not"
stormagnet says, "We'd talked about XP societies before"
stormagnet says, "How that model *itself* could be useful as a rubric"
Crag says, "But we didn't talk about applying XP to the talk about XP societies :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "There's definitely something to that"
stormagnet puts on a bowler hat and stares in the mirror
Crag says, "rubric is a great word"
That is not a valid command.
Try this instead:  givexp to
Crag gives stormagnet an xp for 'rubric'.
