The North Vestibule
A smaller vestibule opening onto the Great Hall. The bones of the old castle are exposed here; the walls exposed rough-hewn blocks of black basalt, the floor smoothly polished stone of the same.  A leather couch is here.  Someone has artfully hung a detailed painting on a wall.
You see Wind-Up Duck here.
stormagnet and Crag are here.
