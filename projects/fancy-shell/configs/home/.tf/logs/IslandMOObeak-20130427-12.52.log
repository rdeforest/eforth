The North Vestibule
A smaller vestibule opening onto the Great Hall. The bones of the old castle are exposed here; the walls rough-hewn blocks of black basalt, the floor smoothly polished stone of the same.  A brown Persian rug lies soft underfoot.  Someone has artfully hung a detailed painting on a wall.  Some chaise longues sit under the windows.  A butler's desk is pushed up against one of the walls.  A demi-lune table stands between the doors, ready to receive calling cards.  A porter's chair stands in the middle of the room, facing the doors.  Some tracery windows are carved into the northern wall.
You see Wind-Up Duck, a microphone, a How $staff will notice people rummaging, and a pile of stuff here.
Crag is here.

From:     Crag
To:       *New-Prog-Log and Beaker
Subject:  @programmer Beaker (#256)

I just gave Beaker a programmer bit.
--------------------------
Property added with value {}.
You now have Generic Input Handler with object number #509 and parent root class (#1).
=> #243 (Crag)
That is not a valid command.
Current building options:

-room          No default room set, uses $room
-exit          No default exit set, uses $exit
-furnishing    @created objects are carried by you, unlocked
-create-set-co @create doesn't change your current object.
-bi-create     @create/@recycle re-use object numbers.
+create-set-co @create sets your current object to the one created.
Alias "input_handler" added to Generic Input Handler(#509).
Aliases for Generic Input Handler(#509) are now {"Generic Input Handler", "input_handler"}
