Crag says, "yeah"

stormagnet says, "I think, and this is a total guess"
stormagnet says, "I think she started with a 7 book contract"

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Overweight women who have   kidney
stones have an increased risk of developing high blood   pressure
(hypertension), according to a new report in the   American
Journal of Kidney Diseases. A similar, but much weaker   association,
was seen among men.

Wednesday, August 31st 2005 14:20:51, from Jet Jaguar

The hardest things for a system administrator to do correctly are to install,
configure and upgrade software so that there are no vulnerabilities an
attacker can exploit, and especially to recover a system that an attacker has
penetrated. The LOCKSS CD includes not just the LOCKSS daemon but also a
pre-configured, highly secure operating system. Because the operating system
is on a non-writable CD, and the configuration is on a non-writable floppy,
it returns to a known-good state after every reboot. The system includes an
automatic software update system that is protected by digital signatures, so
it is upgraded automatically and securely. About every six months the LOCKSS
team releases a new, updated CD. All the operator has to do is to burn the
new CD image, swap CDs and reboot.

------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
I have a passion for communication. The symbols we use to represent ourselves, our thoughts, our dreams, our culture. The symbols we use to bridge the gaps between our internal and external worlds. Extending that bridge across different cultures and values has been a driving motivation in my life, from adolescent existentialist angst to my first experiences with BBS's, hypertext and the Internet, to a lifelong and constant obsession with language itself.
I first thought to tap this passion by pursuing a degree in Computer Science; I am intrigued by the potential for new forms of communication I see in various programming languages, the intersection of databases and networks, and natural language processing.
At first, I dismissed the University of Washington as  prospect, given the notoriously high demand and low admission rates of its Computer Science program. However, after some serious consideration, I no longer think I would be very happy with a long-term career in that field- I found that even at one of the most liberal and progressive colleges, it can still be startlingly hostile to women- eventually my schoolwork and even my personal life began to suffer from the strain. Instead, I am currently considering a career as either a Japanese/English technical translator or a Japanese language teacher. Eventually, I would like to pursue a doctorate of linguistics.
I am extremely impressed by the opportunities the University of Washington provides for pursuing these goals. The course offerings, particularly in Classical Japanese and Technical Japanese, the  internships, the foreign exchange program, the grants, the Department's own exceptional history and reputation- all are very encouraging. 
Originally, my interest in the Japanese language derived from a desire to gain a better understanding of my stepfather, who is a Japanese emigrant. Over time, however, I became fascinated with the language itself, especially as an example of extreme conceptual and lexical density. The balance between ambiguity and efficiency in the Japanese language is something I truly look forward to exploring in depth, and I hope that the University of Washington will provide me with the opportunity to do so.

Crag | PISCES (Feb. 18-March 20): Oh my, things do continue to change almost daily, yes? What you think will happen, doesn't. Who you think will be around, isn't. Where you think you're going, you're not. Then you are. Life right now is a series of ever changing events because life as we know it doesn't have any pattern behind it anymore. The entire world structure is changing. There's nothing to hold onto except each very precious moment in time. You can do this easily with Soul focus.

------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
I have a passion for communication. The symbols we use to represent ourselves, our thoughts, our dreams, our culture. The symbols we use to bridge the gaps between our internal and external worlds. Extending that bridge across different cultures and values has been a driving motivation in my life, from adolescent existentialist angst to my first experiences with BBS's, hypertext and the Internet, to a lifelong and constant obsession with language itself.
I first thought to tap this passion by pursuing a degree in Computer Science; I am intrigued by the potential for new forms of communication I see in various programming languages, the intersection of databases and networks, and natural language processing.
At first, I dismissed the University of Washington as  prospect, given the notoriously high demand and low admission rates of its Computer Science program. However, after some serious consideration, I no longer think I would be very happy with a long-term career in that field- I found that even at one of the most liberal and progressive colleges, it can still be startlingly hostile to women- eventually my schoolwork and even my personal life began to suffer from the strain. Instead, I am currently considering a career as either a Japanese/English technical translator or a Japanese language teacher. Eventually, I would like to pursue a doctorate of linguistics.
I am extremely impressed by the opportunities the University of Washington provides for pursuing these goals. The course offerings, particularly in Classical Japanese and Technical Japanese, the  internships, the foreign exchange program, the grants, the Department's own exceptional history and reputation- all are very encouraging. 
Originally, my interest in the Japanese language derived from a desire to gain a better understanding of my stepfather, who is a Japanese emigrant. Over time, however, I became fascinated with the language itself, especially as an example of extreme conceptual and lexical density. The balance between ambiguity and efficiency in the Japanese language is something I truly look forward to exploring in depth, and I hope that the University of Washington will provide me with the opportunity to do so.

Researchers Say Human Brain is Still Evolving - by CowboyNeal (43% noise) View Skip
Oleg Alexandrov writes .Two genes involved in determining the size of the human brain have undergone substantial evolution in the last 60,000 years, researchers say, suggesting that the brain is still undergoing rapid evolution. The discovery adds further weight to the view that human evolution is still a work in progress, since previous instances of recent genetic change have come to light in genes that defend against disease and confer the ability to digest milk in adulthood..

But if you knew Jon.s mother then you would know that her insistence is the
supreme insistence, trumping all other insistences, including that of the
local and state governments, the Supreme Court, officials at the Pentagon,
and God. God asks Jon.s mother for permission to take a shit.

Instead, Jon.s mother got out of bed and took him outside because she thought
he needed to go wee. Chuck doesn.t ever need to go wee in the middle of the
night. In fact, he can go 24 hours without going wee, but I usually don.t
admit that publicly because that would mean I would have empirical evidence
that he is able to do that, and why would I ever admit to forgetting to let
the dog out for 24 hours? Twice. In one week. Because I thought Jon had let
him out and Jon thought I had let him out, and when we finally did he held
his leg up for so long that he fell asleep while going wee.

*How much does it cost?

Dues, from the National, Regional, and Team levels of the IHSA, have not yet been set for the 2002-2003 season, but will likely be $35-$45. Dues are due at the beginning of the school year. One-hour lessons with the team cost $25 with a minimum of 6 riders in a lesson. Each rider is required to take at least one lesson per quarter with the team or an approved outside trainer (in order to show in jumping classes you must have had at least six months of continuous training over jumps). There are transportation fees to attend the shows (your share of van rental, motel rooms, etc.). The entry fee per class at shows is ~$20, and you can ride in one to four classes per show.

Crag LAUGHS
Crag says, "You're awesome :)"
Crag says, "I wish I could actually laugh while I'm at work without drawing unwanted attention :)"
stormagnet says, "aheehee"
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to love these people"
stormagnet says, "Check out their Halloween targets"

Crag shrugs
stormagnet says, "Clearly, the Dude will not stand "
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "Mini-crush girl is the webmistress!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Go get 'er!"
Crag says, "POUNCE"
stormagnet <- PWNED!
stormagnet says, "Wow, the Kayak club looks like lots of fun too!"
stormagnet says, "oooh- and club meeting times don't conflict with Archery, either"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "WTF? Fencing isn't listed"
stormagnet says, "I'm sure I saw a poster for a fencing club..."
stormagnet says, "Or maybe it's listed under classes?"
stormagnet says, "Yacht club?! Jesus...."
stormagnet says, "Hmmm- that actually looks affordable, though the crowd sounds kind of rich for my tastes..."
stormagnet says, "I'd rather kayak anyway :)"
Crag says, "You can get your kayak fix"
stormagnet NODS!
stormagnet says, "EEeeeeEEE!"
stormagnet says, "Sea kayak camping trips!!"
stormagnet <- HEART
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "It's like all the best parts of summer camp, YEAR ROUND"
Crag says, "2006 is going to be good for you, I think"
Crag says, "Which is good for me, obviously"
Crag says, "That error I pasted at you?  It's a rpm bug"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "maybe not"
stormagnet says, "That thing must be driving you crazy"
stormagnet says, "Yes, the tone of the Kayak club page is WAY more fun than the yacht club page"
stormagnet says, "The only real temptation the yacht club has going for it is that for a small fee, members can rent one of the yachts for private parties and weekend trips."
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "On the kayak club's sea camping advice page, they list "clean clothes for the brew pub" on their camping supplies list"
stormagnet says, "Also, they would like us to know that titanium cook pots are for yuppie scum, and that you will be roundly mocked if you show up with them"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's excellent"
stormagnet says, "It also goes on at length about the uses of duct tape and dental floss"
Crag says, "I think you should have gone to the UW a long time ago :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I absolutely agree"
stormagnet says, "oooh- good to know. They warn against Leatherman brand tools, because they apparently rust rapidly"
Crag says, "That's funny, mind hasn't rusted at all"
stormagnet says, "They say Swiss Army is the way to go for kayak camping"
Crag says, "Maybe because I don't use mine outdoors"
stormagnet says, "Only in marine use"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "The only thing the Leatherman does well is the pliers"
Crag says, "Other than that, Swiss Army knives rule"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'm seriously blissing out"
stormagnet says, "It hadn't occured to me that I would EVER get to go sea kayak camping again"
stormagnet says, "I had, in my wildest dreams, hoped for a day trip"
stormagnet says, "The last time I went, I was on crutches"
stormagnet says, "AND STILL MADE IT UP THE HIKING PATH, TO BOOT"
stormagnet <- badass
Crag says, "You so are!"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "It was steep and rocky, and I got up it by myself while the camp counselors were arguing about who would have to try and carry me, and whether attempting so would even be safe, etc."
Crag says, "Heh heh"
Crag says, "I can totally see that"
stormagnet campaigned pretty hard for them to let her go on the trip
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I wonder if we should try to go to the movie this coming friday"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "In other news, Koizumi pulled through by a landslide"
stormagnet says, "Which I think is FUCKING AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "That man has balls that clank"
Crag says, "Who's that?"
stormagnet says, "The Japanese PM"
Crag says, "Oh, cool"
stormagnet says, "Who, when the cabinet blocked his plan to privatize the postal system"
stormagnet says, "Called for reelections"
stormagnet says, "And ousted the lot via popular appeal"
stormagnet says, "This puts the Japanese government in direct competition with the Keiretsus"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "Which is why it's such a BFD"
stormagnet nods
Crag has Juuni Kokki flashbacks. :)
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "Precisely"
stormagnet says, "The US news agencies are largely clueless about why this is such a big deal"
stormagnet says, "They seem to think that it's some sort of a political stunt"
stormagnet says, "Despite the fact that the PM is publically committed to retiring next year"
Crag says, "I'm gonna be fiercly hungry tonight"
Crag says, "I still haven't eaten yet"
Crag says, "I think I'll have curry as soon as I get home"
Crag says, "yum"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Sounds like a plan"
stormagnet says, "I can make us a fresh pot of rice"
stormagnet says, "And you can take the one I made up for you last night tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to call AHS soon"
stormagnet says, "It's been over 4 hours now, and that's the maximum time I was supposed to have to wait"
Crag says, "Call their bitch asses!"
Crag says, "And tell 'em to SUCK IT"
Crag . o O ( what is wrong with me )
stormagnet says, "SUCK IIITTTT!"
stormagnet says, "Fuckers won't be out until tomorrow morning"
stormagnet says, "GRRR"
Crag says, "BASTARD PEOPLE"
stormagnet says, "BETWEEN 10 AND 2 TOMORROW"
stormagnet says, "FUCK"
stormagnet . o O ( will I get to the gym AT ALL this week?! )
Crag says, "jesus, good thing you didn't have any PLANS OR ANYTHING"
Crag says, "fuckers"
Crag says, "We ought to have some kind of leverage in this"
Crag says, "Like a reach-around"
stormagnet says, "We seem to be at the mercy of our COMPLETELY SHITTY PLUMBING"
Crag nods sadly.
stormagnet says, "Bleah- it's emissions check and insurance payment season"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to call Farmers about that EZPay thing"
stormagnet says, "EXCELLENT"
stormagnet says, "They're setting it up for us now"
stormagnet says, "Her computer hung (again) so she's going to call me back"
stormagnet says, "There's a monthly service charge, based on the premium, somewhere between $5-7"
stormagnet says, "Which is discounted if you use auto bill pay for 6 months"
stormagnet . o O ( And compared to an overdraft fee... )
stormagnet says, "I hate the way insurance payments always sneak up on me"
stormagnet says, "I think, after the refi, that I'd like to get our property tax payments rolled into our mortgage, too"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Sure"
stormagnet says, "At least until we have enough buffer built up that we actually WOULD earn interest on it"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Well..."
Crag says, "Depending on how we handle the refi, we could just start with a buffer"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I think I'd still rather roll it in"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "That's fine with me"
Crag says, "Maybe we could do both"
stormagnet says, "I'm just not the financial badass I need to be"
stormagnet nods
Crag heh
Crag says, "Not YET"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "We need to make some cool apps to help us"
Crag says, "Maybe a Horde module"
stormagnet nodsnods
Crag says, "I'm heading home soon"
stormagnet says, "I'll start some rice, then :)"
stormagnet says, "Nuts"
stormagnet says, "The climbing center DOES charge for use and equipment rentals"
stormagnet says, "might be worth it to me, though, someday"
stormagnet says, "Especially as a way of testing how rehabilitated my knees are :)"
stormagnet says, "Oooh- Aikido classes are free to students!!"
Crag says, "Crikey!"
Crag says, "You could come home and teach me :)"
Crag says, "I'd like that a lot"
stormagnet says, "There's a discount on classes for spouses of students, if you're interested :)"
Crag says, "Ooo, I am!"
Crag idles: heading home

stormagnet says, "ADDRESS!!!"
stormagnet says, "FUCK"
stormagnet says, "I JUST CHECKED!"
stormagnet says, "I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE HAND DELIVERED MY TRANSCRIPTS!!"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "Okay"
stormagnet says, "UW Admissions chick says that if they repostmark it by midnight tomorrow, it's still acceptable"
Crag!
Crag says, "Damn"
stormagnet says, "And that if they fail THAT, there does seem to be a complaints/appeal process"
Crag says, "oh ok"
Crag relaxes a little
stormagnet says, "I CANNOT FUCKING BELIEVE EVERGREEN THOUGH"
Crag says, "damn hippies"
stormagnet says, "EVERGREEN BITCH HAD THE FUCKING BALLS TO BLAME ME!!!!"
Crag says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "SAID I MUST HAVE WRITTEN THE WRONG ADDRESS!!!"
stormagnet says, "A) IT IS THE FUCKING UW- TECHNICALLY, IT *IS* ITS OWN ADDRESS IN THE WA POSTAL SYSTEM"
Crag says, "Pretty hard to mess that up"
stormagnet says, "B) I CHECKED- THE ADDRESS IS PERFECT, DOWN THE OPTIONAL FOUR DIGIT EXTENSION"
Crag says, "That Evergreen chick is just a coward"
stormagnet says, "C) I FAXED MY REQUEST, ACCORDING TO THIS KINKO'S-RECEIPT-THAT-THANK-GOD-I-CHECKED"
stormagnet says, "AUGUST 8TH"
stormagnet says, "YET THEY DO NOT GET BACK TO ME UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE?!"
Crag says, "And although it may work out eventually, you really have no recourse"
stormagnet says, "***AND WHY THE FUCK ISN'T SHE PICKING UP THIS PHONE THAT SHE PROMISED I COULD REACH HER ON?!***"
Crag says, "They have no accountability"
Crag heh
Crag says, "She's hiding under her desk!"
Headline: Missing Evergreen University staff member found under desk after three-day search.     --Crag
Crag . o O ( still refuses to come out )
stormagnet says, "And while I tried to look up the UW address while on the phone with her"
stormagnet says, "FIREFOX HUNG"
stormagnet says, "GODDAMMIT"
Crag says, "Have you checked the calendar?"
Crag says, "I can't remember what your challenging days are this month"
stormagnet says, "Aaaaaaaaaaaand lost my session despite having sessionsaver on!!"
stormagnet checks
Crag says, "I remembered to bring my curry to work"
Crag says, "So today's a good day for me"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
stormagnet says, "SHE TURNED MY 5s into 9s!!"
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "But you've got good handwriting"
Crag says, "She must be high"
stormagnet says, "I CHECKED NOT ONLY MY ORIGINAL FORM BUT MY COPY OF THE FAX"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "IT WAS QUITE CLEAR"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Obviously she's completely incompetent"
stormagnet says, "Rita""
stormagnet says, "I have a name"
stormagnet says, "AND A VENDETTA"
stormagnet says, "VENGEANCE SHALL BE MINE"
stormagnet says, "Seriously, if I don;t get in, I'm going down there and BUSTING HER CHOPS!"
Crag says, "That might be the best thing that ever happened to her"
Crag says, "It could be her wake-up call"
stormagnet says, "BWAH!"
stormagnet says, "You were right"
Crag says, "I was?"
stormagnet says, "14th is listed as a challenge day for me"
Crag says, "I guess that's good"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "It comforts me, somehow"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I tend to look at challenge days as, 'get through this, and we promise it won't get worse'"
Crag says, "I think we're 'supposed' to look at them as 'learning opportunities'..."
stormagnet says, "I had Actually. Meant. To Call. And Confirm. That they had All My Transcripts"
stormagnet says, "DAYS ago"
stormagnet says, "And decided I was being paranoid"
stormagnet says, "And that harassing the office staff was not going to improve my odds of admission any"
stormagnet says, "Etc"
stormagnet says, "You bet your ASS I'm calling now, though"
Crag nodsnods
Crag hugs
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "Then, I plan on playing MAD Harvest Moon"
Crag says, "YAY!"
stormagnet played until 3:30am last 'night'
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I know you tried not to wake me up"
Crag says, "I heard you sneaking in"
Crag says, "It was cute :)"
Crag says, "There are almost exactly 200 unix machines on the Seattle productio network"
stormagnet says, "d'oh!"
stormagnet says, "that means I failed!"
stormagnet blames the cats
Crag laughs
Crag says, "The part that woke me up was the bathroom door"
Crag says, "As you slid it ever. so. slowly."
stormagnet says, "NUTS"
Crag giggles
Crag says, "It's ok"
Crag says, "Oh crap, it's Nicole's birthday"
Crag hms
stormagnet says, "AUIGH!"
Crag says, "She's coming to open mic night tomorrow"
Crag says, "Maybe we could do something nice for her then"
Crag says, "Holy cow, surprise visit by Doug Parish"
Crag says, "The CTO"
Crag tries to calm down
stormagnet says, "meep!"
stormagnet says, "Whew, UW says they have the rest of my transcripts filed and processed :)"
stormagnet says, "That whole debacle was so surreally awful, that, while I was still waking up - as I was asleep when she called- and the number was listed 'unavailable' - that it occured to me that I might be being pranked"
stormagnet says, "Which is good, because I keep my cool better that way"
stormagnet says, "It wasn't until I figured out that I was definitely NOT being pranked, and that this was NOT being played on somebody's speaker phone while the audience stifles giggles, etc, that I Lost My Shit."
stormagnet had a bit of a good old fashioned temper tantrum when she got off the line
stormagnet says, "The Shift key does not do it justice"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "How goes the CTO suprise inspection?"
Crag says, "It may not have been a surprise to anyone else"
Crag says, "But I didn't hear anything about it"
Crag says, "And it wasn't really an inspection, more like a visit"
Crag says, "but still"
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "I'ma go plan some Harvest Moon now, hopefully calm down a little :)"
stormagnet says, "Drink tea"
Crag says, "That sounds good"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Come back and tell me game stories now and then :)"
stormagnet says, "Is wearing a SNUGGLY SWEATER"
stormagnet says, "d'oh"
Crag says, "Yays!"
stormagnet says, "Hee"
stormagnet says, "Snuggly sweaters are up there with warm blankets, chicken soup, and hot chocolate"
Crag says, "Certainly"
Crag says, "Ophelia's kicking ass, in case you haven't heard"
stormagnet says, "All the things I associate with comfort in time of distress are cold weather things"
stormagnet says, "Eep"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't checked my headlines yet"
stormagnet says, "Meh"
stormagnet says, "I need Harvest Moon"
stormagnet says, "Not more things to freak out about"
stormagnet idles: reaping what she sows
Crag grins.
Crag says, "James at work smelled my curry and went nuts with homesickness"
Crag says, "He says you know how to do it right"
Crag says, "he was going to skip lunch, but when he smelled my curry he took off like a shot to go find some food"
Crag says, "He grew up in Japan"
Crag says, "I told him that you cook for Shinya, and I mentioned okinomiyak (sp?) and he said, "I was just talking about that the other day!""
Crag hee hee
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "yay me!"
stormagnet says, "yay curry!"
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "The plumber has been and gone and we officially have toilet use again :P"
stormagnet says, "Speaking of curry"
Crag says, "But for how long..."
stormagnet says, "I'm making the tail end of it for lunch :)"
Crag says, "I'm going to take such a wicked shower tonight"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "'STruth!"
stormagnet says, "I'm bleaching the shower down now :)"
Crag says, "How would you feel about making curry for ~70 people?"
stormagnet says, "FUN!"
Crag says, "Assuming someone else payed for the ingreients and stuff"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "I'd need LOTS of pots and burner space"
stormagnet says, "I was just thinking I should have made a double batch in the stock pot ^_^"
Crag says, "I think I want to try to arrange for DIG to pay for you to feed the techops team"
Crag says, "Maybe for a company picnic or something"
Crag says, "How much does would it cost to make 150 servings?"
Crag says, "I'm sure most people would want two servings :)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "It would cost a lot"
stormagnet says, "A box of Java curry is $3 on sale"
stormagnet says, "and makes 9 servings"
Crag says, "How many servings does a box make?"
That is not a valid command.
Crag loses
Crag says, "Ok, so $0.33 per serving for the curry mix"
stormagnet says, "And the toilet is NOT SO FIXED AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT"
Crag says, "DAMMIT"
stormagnet calls the plumber back
Crag says, "KICK HIS FAT ASS"
Crag rages
stormagnet says, "Actually, dude's a beanpole :P"
Crag says, "Well there's the problem"
Crag says, "All good plumbers are over-weight"
stormagnet says, ":LAUGHS"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet says, "okay, I need to go stir my curry"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Facilities stocks half-n-half in the fridges at the Smith"
Crag says, "I've had a lot of tea today"
Crag says, "I might not have to do a swing shift after all"
Crag says, "We hired a guy for swings this week, and I'm busy with OpenView, so he may go to swings before I'm done"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "Yay day shift!"
stormagnet says, "So, plumbing update:"
stormagnet says, "The operation was successful but the patient died"
stormagnet says, "So, we can use the master toilet, but the main needs to be rebuilt"
stormagnet says, "They're adding it to the work order for the vertical leak, which Greater Seattle Plumbing is going to come look at on Monday"
stormagnet says, "That toilet, among it's other myriad issues, has sprung a leak between the tank and the base"
stormagnet says, "I'ma eat my curry now"
stormagnet says, "Stupid toilet"
Crag says, "good lord"
Crag says, "I don't know about the latest Fedora Core releases, but old Redhat is crap"
Crag idles: not at work
[Idling at 4:23 P.M. on Wed, Sep 14: not at work]
Crag resumes the daily grind
stormagnet says, "Hmmm"
stormagnet says, "Plumber came out to fix the toilet today"
Crag says, "Yeah?"
stormagnet says, "Guess they're coming out AGAIN on Monday"
Crag snorts
stormagnet is going to play A LOT of Harvest Moon
Crag says, "yays!"
stormagnet says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "I haven't even read yesterday's headlines"
Crag says, "There's nothing good going on"
Crag says, "Oh!"
Crag says, "Wikipedia has a page dedicated to the Roberts hearings"
Crag says, "So you can get your Roberts fix there"
Crag says, "AND as you know, wikipedia has the "liberal bias" of being based on reality :)"
Crag says, "Or some semblance of confirmable consensus reality"
Crag sees a dog on tv
Crag says, "they're showing a dog rescue in new orleans"
Crag says, "It looked like a lab"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
stormagnet says, "Don't say anything about it"
stormagnet says, "Hearing about that stuff makes me have nightmares"
stormagnet saw some pics by accident already
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "I'm sorry"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "No, it's totally okay"
stormagnet says, "Just be warned, you may not want to look at some of this either"
Crag says, "I can't help it"
Crag says, "They leave the TV on here"
Crag says, "I think the idea is that if there's another major disaster, the SOC needs to know right away"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Yeah, I understand"
stormagnet says, "It's the visual I can't handle"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "Wow, that was fast"
stormagnet says, "Plumber's done"
Crag says, "SUSPICIOUS"
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "No, I think I get it"
stormagnet says, "The guy yesterday couldn't do it because he was out on a recall"
stormagnet says, "Therefore, fixing something else would be giving me a twofer"
stormagnet says, "But they didn't want to wait until Monday"
stormagnet says, "Because they didn't know how bad it might be"
stormagnet just had the impression that it would take longer
Crag says, "I see"
stormagnet says, "They call it a 'rebuild'"
stormagnet says, "Which sounds impressive and labor intensive"
stormagnet says, "But it really just meant patching the outside and replacing the stuff inside"
stormagnet says, "So, bonus, the toilet won't run any more"
Crag says, "With all this plumbing talk, I've got to go use the plumbing here... :)"
Crag says, "Ok, I'm back"
stormagnet says, ""
stormagnet says, "Hee"

STATEMENTS
==========

The following kinds of statements exist in the MOO programming language:

Null
====

        ;

The null statement does nothing.

Expressions
===========

        expression ;

The expression statement evaluates the expression and then discards the value.

Conditional
===========

        IF ( expression ) statements ENDIF
        IF ( expression ) statements ELSE statements ENDIF
        IF ( expression )
          statements
        ELSEIF ( expression )
          statements
        ...
        ELSE
          statements
        ENDIF

The conditional statement evaluates each expression in turn and executes the statements associated with the first one to return a true value; the ELSE statements are executed if none of the expressions returns a true value.  There can be any number of ELSEIF clauses and the ELSE part is optional.  See `help truth'[1] for the definition of 'true value'.

List iteration
==============

        FOR name IN ( expression ) statements ENDFOR

The list iteration statement first evaluates the expression, which must return a list.  It then executes the statements once for each element of that list, each time with the named variable having the value of the corresponding list element.

Numeric iteration
=================

        FOR name IN [ expression .. expression ] statements ENDFOR

The numeric iteration statement first evaluates the two expressions, both of which must return numbers; call those numbers N1 and N2, respectively.  The statements are then executed once for each integer I such that N1 <= I <= N2, in increasing order; each time, the named variable has the corresponding value of I.

Indefinite iteration
====================

        WHILE ( expression ) statements ENDWHILE

The indefinite iteration statement repeatedly evaluates the expression and, each time it returns a true value, executes the statements.  The loop stops the first time that the expression returns a false value.  The definitions of 'true' and 'false' values is in `help truth'[2].

Return
======

        RETURN ;
        RETURN expression ;

The return statement evalautes the expression, if any, and returns the resulting value (or 0 if there is no expression) to the verb that called the current one.  Execution of the current verb is immediately terminated.

Fork
====

        FORK ( expression ) statements ENDFORK
        FORK name ( expression ) statements ENDFORK

The fork statement first executes the expression, which must return a number; call that number N.  It then creates a new MOO task that will, after at least N seconds, execute the statements.  When the new task begins, all variables will have the values they had at the time the FORK statement was executed.  The task executing the FORK statement immediately continues execution.  If a variable name is given after the FORK keyword, then it is assigned the 'queue ID' of the newly-created task.  The value of this variable is visible both to the task executing the fork statement and to the statements in the newly-created task.  See `help tasks'[3] for more information about forked tasks.

Power-dressing man leaves trail of destruction
Fri Sep 16, 2005 10:30 AM ET

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian man built up a 40,000-volt charge of static electricity in his clothes as he walked, leaving a trail of scorched carpet and molten plastic and forcing firefighters to evacuate a building.

Frank Clewer, who was wearing a woolen shirt and a synthetic nylon jacket, was oblivious to the growing electrical current that was building up as his clothes rubbed together.

When he walked into a building in the country town of Warrnambool in the southern state of Victoria Thursday, the electrical charge ignited the carpet.

"It sounded almost like a firecracker," Clewer told Australian radio Friday.

"Within about five minutes, the carpet started to erupt."

Employees, unsure of the cause of the mysterious burning smell, telephoned firefighters who evacuated the building.

"There were several scorch marks in the carpet, and we could hear a cracking noise -- a bit like a whip -- both inside and outside the building," said fire official Henry Barton.

Firefighters cut electricity to the building thinking the burns might have been caused by a power surge.

Clewer, who after leaving the building discovered he had scorched a piece of plastic on the floor of his car, returned to seek help from the firefighters.

"We tested his clothes with a static electricity field meter and measured a current of 40,000 volts, which is one step shy of spontaneous combustion, where his clothes would have self-ignited," Barton said.

"I've been firefighting for over 35 years and I've never come across anything like this," he said.

Firefighters took possession of Clewer's jacket and stored it in the courtyard of the fire station, where it continued to give off a strong electrical current.

David Gosden, a senior lecturer in electrical engineering at Sydney University, told Reuters that for a static electricity charge to ignite a carpet, conditions had to be perfect.

"Static electricity is a similar mechanism to lightning, where you have clouds rubbing together and then a spark generated by very dry air above them," said Gosden.

Proceedings quickly became acrimonious Tuesday morning, as Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) openly challenged Robert's claim that he "had not made up
his mind" on Logan v. Wayne. "With all due respect, I find it frankly
unbelievable that, in 30 years of public service, you could not have formed
an opinion on this matter," Kennedy said. "So I would again ask that you
simply answer the question: who would win in a fight, Wolverine or Batman?"

Seemingly nonplussed, Roberts demurred, saying, "while I'm happy to talk
about the individual strengths and weaknesses of each, I don't think I should
get into the application of their powers in a mano a mano confrontation."

An example of the madness HR systems operate under: 

Saturday, September 17th 2005 11:19:45, from Youre On Fire

I entered this in Cube> and aborted coz it's too self-aggrandizing.


At work, I feel like that part of Harold and Kumar, where Harold doesn't talk
to the girl and Kumar says "You're worthless!" and Harold says "I'm not
worthwhile."

Yesterday I was trying to understand (WARNING IT GETS SORT OF TECHNICAL HERE)
how the parser/conceptualizer/search engine recognizes college degrees.
Because the short answer, as far as I'm concerned, is it does not. It gets
them about 1 time out of 15, which means you have a whole ton of resumes that
look like they never went to college, when in fact they all have phds - or in
the case of pharmacists (one of the degrees it is crucial to recognize)
PharmD. I mean, how hard can it be to pick out that degree? Smart Match, you
are DUM! So I talked to LeatherDaddy (yes, I am incapable of NOT giving my
co-workers cutesy nicknames) and he said that the parser broke out the
education section based on whitespace andthen conceptualized by looking at
the ontology's list of institutions and then looking at what was near that
institution name and matching that to its list of possible degree
abbreviations. I am not allowed access to the list of degree abbreviations as
that is part of the conceptualizer. I told LeatherDaddy, "well, it sucks at
that and it must suck because the moron ontologist before me only entered in
the top 50 institutions based on the US News and World Report survey, right?"

LeatherDaddy looked kind of blank. "Yes, maybe. I'm not 100% certain that it
is doing what I just said it is doing because the person who wrote the code
before me didn't comment it and appears to have been learning as he went. So
that's just a guess."

I said, "Well, it's easy to test. I enter in a ton of new institutions."

He said, "No, we don't know if the ontology can be entered into the
alexandria bridge yet, and I have no visibility into that piece."

I said, "It's still easy to test. Replace everyone's institution of higher
learning with one of the top fifty and re-conceptualize them."

He sort of stared at me in shock. "That's an EXCELLENT idea." It was exactly
as if a dog had started talking to him. "I would NEVER have thought of that.
Wow."

It just goes to show.

Anyway. I said, "If you want to torture test a search engine, you come to me.
It's my thing."

Sigh.

Minty says, "aww!"
Minty says, "I'm still looking for a harness and cart for my little miniature horse, I may have a hit on one."
Crag says, "MINIATURE HORSE?!"
stormagnet . o O ( ............. )
Minty says, "Yes!!"
stormagnet keels over
Crag says, "OMG"
Minty says, "Lol"
stormagnet blacks out
Minty says, "eek!"
Crag says, "How small is it?"
Minty says, "She is only the size of a St. Bernard."
Crag says, "that's awesome"
Minty says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "Stormy and I need to get a farm"
stormagnet . o O ( oooooooooooo )
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet wakes
Crag laughs
Minty says, "We put up some of our hay in the big round bales this year, some guy bought all the bales.. and he has some draft horses.. his daughter has the cart and harness for sale.  Im hoping she will give me as good a deal on the cart and harness, as I did for the bales of hay."
stormagnet had a SEVERE CUTE ATTACK
Minty says, "Yes! Living on a farm is awesome!"
Minty says, "Lol"
Crag says, "I bet property in southern Oregon would be pretty cheap"
Crag says, "Maybe a little isolated now"
stormagnet whimpers
Minty says, "I dunno"
Crag says, "But in a few years it might not be so much"
Minty says, "Exactly!"
Crag says, "California will never be cheap"
stormagnet nods
Minty says, "Nope"
Crag says, "And northern oregon is too far north for me"
Minty says, "Lol"
Crag says, "I've got to live well below the 45th parallel"
stormagnet . o O ( horsiehorsiehorsiehorsiehorsiehorsiehorsieponyhorsiehorsie )
Crag laughs
Minty says, "Lol!"
Minty says, "I have been around horses all my life.  I started riding when I was 2 years old."
stormagnet O_O
Minty says, "Lol"
stormagnet . o O ( HORSIEHORSIEHORSIE! )
Minty says, "Lmao!"
stormagnet . o O ( stupid uw )
stormagnet . o O ( stupid rich kids )
Minty says, "Crag.. she needs a horse, man.."
stormagnet . o O ( stupid equestarian club )
Minty says, "Lol"
Crag says, "I know"
stormagnet . o O ( mocking me )
Crag says, "I'm working as hard as I can"
stormagnet . o O ( we'll show them )
stormagnet . o O ( we'll show them all! )
Minty says, "Yes!"
stormagnet says, "yukjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"
stormagnet says, "CAT!"
Minty says, "Showing can be awesome, but there is some pretty stiff competetion out there now."
stormagnet kicks Marco off the keyboard
Minty says, "Rich people with expensive horses.."
stormagnet <- Aspiring Horse Thief
Minty says, "Lol"
stormagnet says, "I was all worked up last week because I saw Equestarian Club listed on the sports club lists at the university"
Minty says, "That guy that was here to buy those big bales of hay over the weekend, offered me $1500 for my horse.  I told him that if that was all he was offering me, I know she is worth more."
Crag says, "I should think so"
Minty says, "And, he wants her really bad."
stormagnet says, "But it turned out that, unlinke ALL THE OTHER CLUBS, you had to pay for everything yourself"
Minty nods.
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet says, "How much does it cost to keep a horse?"
Minty says, "I'm not talking about my miniature, I'm talking about my big horse."
stormagnet pictures them side by side
stormagnet pictures the miniature standing UNDER the big horse
Minty says, "I dunno what it costs to keep a horse, I never really kept track.  I do know that when I board horses, I charge $150 per horse, per month."
stormagnet keels over again
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "Yeah, the miniature can walk right under my bigger horse.. its funny."
stormagnet DIES!!
Minty says, "Lol!"
Minty performs CPR.
stormagnet is resurrected
Minty says, "Yayyyyyy!"
stormagnet says, "Wow, that's a lot less than I thought it would cost"
Minty says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "That might not be entirely out of my league after all..."
stormagnet . o O ( .............. )
Minty says, "Well, we put up our own hay... so cost wise for us is relatively cheap.. but then you have to purchase all the equipment to put up the hay too.. but that's basically only a one time shot."
stormagnet says, "True"
Minty says, "But you can find farm equipment pretty cheap.. if you can find some used stuff."
stormagnet says, "Boarding out here is probably a lot more expensive"
Minty says, "Good used stuff.. not junk."
stormagnet . o O ( save me google! )
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "I'm guessing that if you are in an area where grass is a year round thing, boarding and buying hay would be relatively cheap."
Crag says, "Is there some kind of horse time-share thing? :)"
Minty says, "We have to figure that hay has to be fed for at least 6 months out of the year."
Minty says, "I dunno.. lol"
stormagnet says, "Ooooh- there's a place in Kirkland...."
stormagnet says, "It has lessons!"
Minty says, "Wowza!"

stormagnet says, "One hour"
Minty says, "eww"
stormagnet sighs
Minty says, "Thats expensive!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That's why only rich kids do it"
stormagnet  ;_;
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Is that like at a camp or something, where you actually live there?  That, I could see."
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "HELL no"
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "Damn!"
stormagnet says, "Though it does get cheaper if you have more lessons"
stormagnet says, "Two a week is $350, etc...."
Minty says, "Ahh.. so you would have to be committed.. like they have a contract or something.."
stormagnet says, "Nope"
Minty says, "No?"
stormagnet says, "They have single lessons for $50"
Minty says, "Holy cow!"
stormagnet sighs
Minty says, "Still, $50 per hour is high.."
Minty frowns.
stormagnet . o O ( BE GOOD RAINE BE GOOD )

Minty is never good.

stormagnet says, "Board out here is a LOT more expensive"
Minty says, "aww :("
stormagnet says, "To the tune of $650/month"
Minty faints.
Minty says, "Man.. Im living in the wrong area!"
Crag [to Minty]: yes, move out here so we can pounce you IRL
Minty says, "You know, thats the problem.. if those people know they can get that kind of money, and people are foolish enough to pay it.. why not jack their prices up?  But it makes it bad for the people that cannot afford to pay that, but want it bad."
Minty says, "lol"
Crag says, "At least it's not something people depend on to live"
Crag says, "if it were food or clothing human housing, that would be a lot more disturbing"
Crag says, "Or gas prices..."
Minty says, "I dunno what keeps me here, except that this is where my roots are.. but omg.. I hate the winters."
Crag says, "I bet"
Crag says, "You've told me some stories.  I don't think I could handle it"
Crag says, "I'd leave before my first winter was over"
Minty says, "-4- to -50 is too cold for me anymore."
Minty says, "-40 *"
Crag says, "I used to think I'd like to live in Alaska, but Seattle beat that outta me"
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "Yeah, the cold really sux."
Crag says, "And the DARK"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I'm just not a tough person"
Crag says, "At least not that way"
Minty says, "I guess I must be."
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "So far, we have had a pretty warm September.. usually its darn cold by now.. we are still having temps in 70 to 80 degrees.  Really tolerable."
Minty says, "And Im afraid that when winter sets in, its gonna slam us good."
Crag says, "Who knows"
Minty says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Something's definitely going on"
Minty says, "yep"
Crag says, "With all the tropical storms and all"
Minty says, "And we are ready for it, we have most of our firewood in."
Crag says, "We need to look into getting firewood"
Minty says, "Unfortunately, we still have to buy propane to keep the garage heated, and the milk house.  We have gas furnaces out there, we have to keep the milkhouse warm coz we have running water out there."
Crag nods.
Minty says, "One thing nice about having the wood stove in our basement, even without carpeting, our floors are still nice and warm.  There is nothing worse than getting out of bed in the morning, and putting your warm feet on an ice cold floor."
Minty laughs.
Crag says, "totally"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "If you noticed, Crag.. we now have satellite internet.. and I'm loving it!"
Crag says, "YAY!"
Minty says, "Yes!"

Crag heh
Crag says, "I'm glad it's working out for you"
Minty giggles.
Crag says, "I'll be curious to hear more about your experiences"
Minty says, "It is..omg.. I cannot believe the difference.. it's suppose to be at least 12 times faster than dialup."
Crag says, "I'd always heard it's implemented as two connections, one for each direction, and that your outbound connection is still just dialup"
Crag says, "But maybe what you got is different"
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "CAN'T"
stormagnet says, "STOP"
Minty says, "I uninstalled dialup, but the dialup modem is still in my compy."
stormagnet says, "LOOKING"
Minty says, "Lmao.. Raine!! Control yourself!!  ;)"
stormagnet says, "It gets cheaper the furthur out you go...."
Minty says, "coolies!"
stormagnet says, "I keep thinking about gas prices, etc....."
Minty nods.
Crag [to Minty]: you still have high latency
Crag says, "I'm getting 600ms or more to ping you"
Minty says, "Latency?"
Crag says, "The time between when I send the packet and when you get it"
stormagnet says, "THere's a place closer to Tacoma that has 4 lessons/month for $160"
Minty says, "Ohhh"
Crag says, "The round-trip time between us is over half a second"
Minty says, "You mean lag?"
Crag says, "yeah"
Minty says, "I have no lag."
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "oooooooh"
Minty says, "I remember you saying that there would be with MOOing, but I'm not experiencing any lag."

Crag [to stormagnet]: You should do it
stormagnet says, "And I think it would even be enough lesson hours to qualify me for the club at the UW"
Minty nods.
stormagnet . o O ( student loans student loans student loans )
Crag [to Minty]: Maybe it's just so much less than you had before that it feels like nothing
Crag says, "I didn't try pinging you on your old connection"
Minty [to Crag]: that could be.. I dont know enough about it.
Crag says, "Also, your connection is very reliable, so maybe your old net had a lot of packet loss"
Crag says, "The important thing is that you're happy"
Minty says, "Thats possible."
Minty says, "I am!! I'm a happy camper!"
Minty dances.
Minty says, "lol"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Congradulations"
Minty says, "Well, one thing for sure, dialup was not meant for text."
Minty says, "Thanks!"
Minty says, "With dialup.. downloading music was sooooooooo slow.. like some songs took like 30 minutes to 45 minutes... now, 5 minutes tops."
Minty says, "And I download lots of music."
Crag says, "Yeah, downloads are where satelite really wins"
Minty says, "Yes1"
Minty says, "!*"
Crag says, "You will get an extra boost because they will do some hidden caching for you"
Minty says, "Stupid typoes."
Crag says, "So if you're downloading something someone else downloaded already, there's a good chance you'll save a few seconds there"
Minty says, "Yep."
Crag says, "So for popular web sites with a lot of static images you'll get a big boost in performance"
stormagnet says, "I NEED to reincarnate the Typo Mallet"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "oooooooh"
Minty says, "Typo Mallet?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: I found justification for using student loan money on horseback riding lessons
Crag [to Minty]: Anime style cartoon mallet for bashing typos
stormagnet [to Minty]: I used to have a toy in the MOO for venting typo frustrations
stormagnet loses!
Minty says, "Ahh"
stormagnet [to Crag]: this place? down in puyallup? the cheap one?
Crag [to Minty]: Other news: stormagnet rode a mechanical bull a few times last month
Crag [to stormagnet]: yes?
Minty [to stormagnet]: Mechanical Bull???  How did you do?
stormagnet [to Crag]: it has a certification program for becoming a riding instructor
Crag [to stormagnet]: awesome
stormagnet laughs
Crag [to Minty]: She did great
stormagnet [to Minty]: I didn't die
stormagnet loses!
Minty [to stormagnet]: Awesome!
Crag says, "Although, our stripped friend did best of all"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "But she's super buff and stuff"
Minty says, "lol"

Minty says, "aww"
stormagnet says, "It didn't really hurt"
Minty says, "Cool!"
stormagnet says, "I was just extremely gnarly"
Minty says, "Lol"
Minty says, "I bet!"
stormagnet says, "Fist sized, bright purple with yellow highlights, etc."
Minty says, "Wow!"
Minty says, "I've had lots of them with just horseback riding, and getting thrown off."
Minty laughs.
stormagnet says, "I swear, by the end of the night, our friend didn't so much get thrown off as wear out"
stormagnet says, "She was GOOD"
Crag nodsnods
Minty says, "Awesome!"
Minty says, "Have either of you watched this program called Cowboy U on CMT?"
Crag says, "And then after all our female friends rode the bull, guys lined up to ride and none of them lasted very long"
stormagnet shakes her heard
Crag says, "We don't have tv"
Crag says, "We're freaks :)"
Crag says, "By choice though"
stormagnet makes tea, brb
Minty says, "Omg.. its so funny.. these city slickers go to this Ranch, and they learn everything a cowboy has to do.. and its hilarious.. but some of them turn out to be pretty damn good."
Crag says, "That does sound amusing"
Minty says, "I dont watch much tv.. mostly CMT, coz its got country music on a lot."
Crag says, "I like to see people challange their assumptions"
Minty [to Crag]: It's a really good program, and this dude thats on there, shows absolutely no mercy at all.. and some of these guys that go there to learn stuff, are outdone by lots of the chicks on there.. its so funny to see the guys get their egos busted down a notch or two.. thinking they are going there to kick some ass, and they are severely defeated by the gals.
Minty laughs.
Crag says, "excellent"
Minty says, "It cracks me up."
Crag says, "I have no delusions of toughness, myself"

Minty says, "Ok, I gotta get going.. I still have some things to do, then wash the walls in the bathroom and get that ready to renovate.. eww >.<"
Crag says, "Yeah, I need to get to work too"
Minty says, "Ok, I can add you right now, if you'd like Crag."

stormagnet [to Minty]: you should stalk us
Minty says, "I was bored one day, and was looking around at stuff on my compy.. I had no clue what the character map was, or what it was used for.. so I messed around with it, made my name there, copied and pasted it to my msn.. and voila!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "That's excellent"

On Friday September 16, 2005, one day shy of the fifth anniversary of our
first date, Kiyash and I are eloping to City Hall in San Francisco.

There will be a cupcake picnic in City Hall Plaza... a "first dance" made
possible by portable speakers for my iPod... a champagne toast at the Ritz
Carlton...

then, a series of daily 10 - 15 mile city hikes around San Francisco... and
extreme culinary debauchery at our favorite restaurants (The Cosmopolitan
Cafe, Le Colonial, and brunch at the Palace's Garden Court)...

there will be theater (The Overcoat at ATC)... and movies (Whatever Happened
to Baby Jane at the Castro)... and music (a jazz set at Biscuit and Blues)...

Then we will hop into a Jaguar X-type and drive down the coast to a luxury
camping lodge... for two nights on the beach, with more hiking, wine tasting,
picnicking, sunrises and sunsets.

Our wedding bands are engraved with the GPS coordinates (to the sixth decimal
place) of the Chow Bar in New York City, where we met on September 17, 2000.
My ring has the latitude, and Kiyash's ring has the longitude.

I love you, Kiyash.

Follow these 17 guidelines to kill the logic of any sentence. Start with this
familiar example:

Jack and Jill climbed up the hill to fetch a pail of water.

   1. Use weak verbs:
      Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a pail of water.

   2. Use unfamiliar words:
      Jack and Jill climbed up the hill to fetch a ewer of water.

   3. Put introductory phrases at the beginning to push the subject back:
      To fetch a pail of water, Jack and Jill climbed up the hill.

   4. Keep the subject and the verb as far apart as possible:
      Jack and Jill, to fetch a pail of water, climbed up the hill.

   5. Put the action at the end of the sentence:
      Jack and Jill, to fetch a pail of water, climbed up the hill.

   6. Keep modifiers as far as possible from the words they modify:
      Jack and Jill climbed to fetch a pail of water up the hill.

   7. Use passive voice:
      The hill was climbed by Jack and Jill so that a pail of water could be
fetched.

   8. Put the doer at the end of the sentence:
      To fetch a pail of water, the hill was climbed by Jack and Jill.

   9. Introduce false subjects:
      It was Jack and Jill that climbed up the hill to fetch a pail of water.

  10. Pile on the gobbledygook:
      Jack and Jill ascended the acclivity to retrieve a vessel of Adam's ale.

  11. Turn verbs into nouns:
      Jack and Jill did the hill climb for the purpose of water retrieval.

  12. Use unnecessary technical jargon:
      Jack and Jill traversed the gradient to fetch an alembic of H2O.

  13. Feature inappropriate precision:
      John Q. Wembley and Jillian Fitzgerald climbed 1.6093 kilometers to
fetch 3.785 liters of water.

  14. Add wordy phrases:
      Jack in the company of Jill climbed their way up the hill for the
purpose of fetching water in the approximate amount of a pail's full.

  15. Multiply redundant words:
      Both Jack and Jill climbed all the way up to the top of the hill's
summit to fetch a pail filled to its capacity with water.

  16. Throw in clichs indiscriminately:
      Jack and Jill, who need no introduction, climbed up the hill by leaps
and bounds to fetch through their good offices a pail of water by hook or by
crook

  17. String lots of nouns together to form the subject:
      The Jack and Jill water retrieval hill climb was achieved.

Put all 17 together:
It was the Jack and Jill H2O retrieval in an alembic vessel that was achieved
via the ascent of the acclivity up to its summit in leaps and bounds through
the good offices of John Q. Wembley and Jillian Fitzgerald who need no
introduction.

stormagnet says, "Still, the vast majority of schools in Seattle qualify as low-income"
stormagnet says, "Though sadly, Nova is not on the list."

Crag says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "So, I can get about $5k a year waived for 5 years via WA, and an additional $5k of Stafford waived"
Crag says, "That helps the cause"
stormagnet says, "So, I'll want to get a Stafford right away, and then apply for the WA program next year"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "And we get a $2.5k deduction"

stormagnet says, "That teachers don't get paid much"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "But, then, neither do translators"
stormagnet says, "But perhaps with their powers combined..."
Crag says, "What about going to Japan?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That's what I really want to do"
stormagnet says, "I'll have to teach in the states for at least 5 years if I want my loans waived, though"

stormagnet says, "There's grants and scholarships, which I'm still looking for"
stormagnet says, "And, the Japanese Department of Education may be more desperate for English teachers than Washington State Department of Education is for Japanese teachers..."
Crag says, "That seems likely"
Crag says, "to me"
stormagnet says, "You could always go back to school and become a high school teacher"
stormagnet says, "So there's that, too :P"
Crag says, "You'd have to be able to support me first"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But it does sound like fun to me"
stormagnet says, "Infite timeline"
stormagnet says, "We'll always have options"
Crag says, "Our timeline isn't actually infinite until our first successful de-aging treatments."

Crag laughs
Crag says, "Always"
stormagnet says, "Salary.com says I can expect about $40k gross annual as a High School teacher"
Crag says, "That's not so bad"
Crag says, "but I'd still have to work for a while"
Crag says, "I don't know what it would do to our taxes"
stormagnet says, "eep- adjusted for experience, it's more like $36k"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Deployed to at least 125 nodes total"

Psychopaths could be best financial traders?
Mon Sep 19, 2005 02:45 PM ET

LONDON (Reuters) - "Wanted: psychopaths to make a killing in the markets."

Such an advert will not be appearing in the world's newspapers any time soon, but it may have a ring of truth after research revealed the best wheeler-dealers could well be "functional psychopaths."

A team of U.S. scientists has found the emotionally impaired are more willing to gamble for high stakes and that people with brain damage may make good financial decisions, the Times newspaper reported Monday.

In a study of investors' behavior 41 people with normal IQs were asked to play a simple investment game. Fifteen of the group had suffered lesions on the areas of the brain that affect emotions.

The result was those with brain damage outperformed those without.

The scientists found emotions led some of the group to avoid risks even when the potential benefits far outweighed the losses, a phenomenon known as myopic loss aversion.

One of the researchers, Antione Bechara, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Iowa, said the best stock market investors might plausibly be called "functional psychopaths."

Fellow author, Baba Shiv of Stanford Graduate School of Business said many company chiefs and top lawyers may also show they share the same trait.

"Emotions serve an adaptive role in speeding up the decision-making process," said Shiv.

"However, there are circumstances in which a naturally occurring emotional response must be inhibited, so that a deliberate and potentially wiser decision can be made."

The study, published in June in the journal Psychological Science, was conducted by a team of researchers from Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Iowa.

Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "Why do people make things more difficult for themselves?"
Crag says, "For example"
Crag says, "This OpenView agent software uses threading extensively"
Crag says, "It has dozens of threads when it's fully running"
Crag says, "But I don't see what it buys"
Crag says, "Apache uses multiple threads to reduce the latency when handling a new connection"
Crag says, "Since the threads are pre-started there's no need to allocate memory or process structures when a connection comes in"
Crag says, "GUIs use multiple threads to pass the event-handling problem on to the kernel"
Crag says, "But this OpenView software has three jobs, and none of them need to be highly responsive."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "What's worse"
stormagnet says, "They want 1337 cR3|)?"
Crag says, "This use of threading makes porting the app between kernel and library versions sketchy at best"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "They could just use regular processes and IPC, but instead they're using threads and (presumably) shared memory"
Crag says, "Which is now failing because IT SUCKS"
Crag says, "It works most of the time, but when it fails, it's very tricky to debug"
Crag says, "So have you caught up on headlines?"

Crag says, "techies need to get over the idea that firewalls make networks secure"
Crag says, "If I have to punch holes through the firewalls for every service the hosts run, there aren't any packets the firewalls can block that the hosts themselves wouldn't already block"
Crag says, "Or at least ignore"
stormagnet says, "Tell them to climb the damn wall and then drop and give you 50, the pansy bitches"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I think the 'idea' behind firewalls is that there are services which hosts run which are insecurable, so access to those ports should be restricted to 'trusted' hosts."
Crag says, "And if that's how firewalls were used, they'd be OK"
Crag says, "But here at DIG we keep hosts which are SUPPOSED to talk to each other from doing so."

     How does a word meaning "footstool" turn into a word meaning "mess"?
Start with the Latin "scamillum," meaning "little bench." Modify the spelling
and you get the Old English "sceamol," meaning "a footstool" or "a table used
for counting money or exhibiting goods." Alter again to the Middle English
"shamele," and the meaning can easily become more specific: "a table for the
exhibition of meat for sale." Pluralize and you have the base of the
15th-century term "shambles," meaning "meat market." A century takes
"shambles" from "meat market" to "slaughterhouse," then to figurative use
referring to a place of terrible slaughter or bloodshed (say, a battlefield).
The scene of a slaughter can get messy, so it's logical for the word to pick
up the modern sense "mess" or "state of great confusion." Transition
accomplished.

saying:  "Yesterday, 3 Brazilian soldiers were killed."
"OH NO!" the President exclaims.  "That's terrible!"
His staff sits stunned at this display of emotion, nervously watching as the
President sits, head in hands.
Finally, the President looks up and asks, "How many is a brazillion?"

When poor black people do it, it's called "looting." When poor white people
do it, it's called "finding" or "salvaging."



When rich people do it on a massively larger scale, it's called "a no-bid

I guess I should point out Tarpon Springs, Florida is home to a large Greek
population, and kids boasting this Mediterranean heritage comprised more than
half the student body. A large portion of the faculty were Greek. They even
offered Greek for the language requirements. If there.s anything I learned
during my studies at Tarpon High, besides .ask what the pill does before you
eat it,. it.s that everyone on the planet is less evolved than the Greeks.

In fact, I once had a teacher just come out and tell me, .Patrick, we had
advanced mathematics and philosophy while your people were painting
themselves blue, living in caves and poking each other in the ass with
spears..

I pretended to be impressed, but, honestly, the whole blue thing with the
spears didn.t sound too bad. Especially compared to math. Shit, come to think
of it, I.d probably still go with the cave, given the choice. I mean, I can
barely stand to put on pants.

He may just want to follow you around for a few months and construct a film out of that. Your humor is either dry or non-existant, but your life is somewhat exciting romantically because you're "bad."

Bennett under fire for remarks on blacks, crime

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congressional Democrats blasted former Education
Secretary William Bennett on Thursday for saying that aborting "every black
baby in this country" would reduce the crime rate, and demanded their
Republican counterparts do the same.

"This is precisely the kind of insensitive, hurtful and ignorant rhetoric
that Americans have grown tired of," said Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois.

White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan told reporters on Friday that
President Bush "believes the comments were not appropriate."

------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------

Bennett, who held prominent posts in the administrations of former presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush, told a caller to his syndicated radio talk
show Wednesday: "If you wanted to reduce crime, you could -- if that were
your sole purpose -- you could abort every black baby in this country and
your crime rate would go down.

"That would be an impossibly ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to
do, but your crime rate would go down," he said.

Crag says, "However"
Crag says, "OH"

Crag says, "It's so that someone can't deep-link to a flash object and then pretend to host it."
Crag says, "I think"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes, I bet the object doesn't know where it came from, so it asks the browser where the current _page_ came from"
Crag says, "So if someone links to someone else's flash, the flash object will talk to the linking server instead of the linked server"
Crag says, "OHH"
Crag says, "And more importantly, if someone downloads and hosts a copy of the flash, the object has no record of where it came from"
Crag says, "I'm still not sure I like the solution, though."

The lost boys, thrown out of US sect so that older men can marry more wives

Julian Borger in Washington
Tuesday June 14, 2005
The Guardian

Up to 1,000 teenage boys have been separated from their parents and thrown out
of their communities by a polygamous sect to make more young women available
for older men, Utah officials claim.

Many of these "Lost Boys", some as young as 13, have simply been dumped on the
side of the road in Arizona and Utah, by the leaders of the Fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), and told they will never
see their families again or go to heaven.

Python Eats Gator, Stomach Ruptures
Snakes, Gators Compete In Everglades

POSTED: 11:25 am EDT October 5, 2005

MIAMI -- A python's eyes were apparently bigger than its stomach.

Scientists in Florida are puzzling over a Burmese python that scarfed down a
six-foot alligator before its stomach ruptured.

They found the carcasses in an isolated part of Florida's Everglades National
Park. Photos show the gator's hind legs and tail sticking out of the 13-foot
snake's ruptured gut.

The Miami Herald reported that scientists can't figure out how the snake got
the critter down. The snake's head is also missing.

Experts say the clash is interesting, but it also shows the exotic snakes are
competing with gators to top the food chain in the Everglades.

Park biologist Skip Snow said he's documented 156 python captures in the last
two years.

Crag says, "When I was interviewing for this job back in '01 Paul asked me an interview question that was something like: money's no object, how do you design a system to handle as much traffic as possible, with minimal latency, and with the ability to test and roll out static and dynamic content, ..."
Crag says, "And there were some other related specifications"
Crag says, "I had no answer then, but I think I have one now."
Crag says, "And it's a three layer system"
Crag says, "The first layer accepts and "interprets" web requests."
Crag says, "It converts the request into a "web job""
Crag says, "The jobs have their relevant sorting criteria gathered and hashed"
Crag says, "With the intent that they can be selected by likely groupings such as website, path, session, application"
Crag says, "and user"
Crag says, "Which is really the same as session"
Crag says, "This top layer checks its own cache to see if it can satisfy the request itslef"
Crag says, "But if not, it puts a "help me" message in any and all relevant queues"
Crag says, "The second layer picks up these help-me messages"
Crag says, "Each machine in the second layer is looking for questions it already knows the answer to, or is likely to have a quick answer for"
Crag says, "But if a message is in the queue too long (500ms?) then machines with the lowest load grab those instead."
Crag says, "The third tier is the database layer which manages all the content, active and static"
Crag says, "And I have some other ideas I will expound on later"
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "How complicated would that hash be?"
stormagnet says, "Are the sorting criteria already there, or would you have to design them, I mean?"
stormagnet says, "I could totally see singing ALL Decemberist songs to our kids"
stormagnet says, "They have that awesome macabre fairy tale feel"
Crag says, "The hashing would just condense all the information (hostname, path, user) into a small (32bit?) number.  Odds are good that if you've seen a hash before, you've still got all the data it needs handy."
Crag says, "It doesn't have to be right though :0"
Crag says, ":) even"
Crag says, "Actually, my idea needs a lot of work"
Crag says, "There's a layer above the machines that receive the TCP connections which does the transparent routing of connections to those initial servers."
Crag says, "That layer would need to scale too"
Crag says, "I'm trying to come up with a way for one server farm to handle ALL DIG traffic at once"
Crag says, "So it needs to be able to handle at least 2gig of traffic to any one site, and5gig system-wide"
Crag says, "One of the things it needs to do is adapt to the traffic"
Crag says, "So it tries to send related traffic to related servers, but will re-allocate servers when popularity of sites changes"
Crag says, "80% of the traffic might be football, and then suddenly there's big news and everyone wants to hit abcnews.  All the layers need to adjust to that on demand"
Crag says, "And my other goal is to allow QA to happen on production servers by having servers partitioned and by using the traffic dispersal layers to sample normal traffic for use in testing by replaying it against a testing partition."
Crag says, "And all of this that I'm talking about needs to not care about static vs dynamic content"
Crag says, "And the dynamic hosting needs to not care what language its content was written in (within reason)"
Crag says, "So there'd need to be an efficient webapp plugin system that could be swapped in and out on demand"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "it's all wanking for now :P"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "It could turn into more, someday"
stormagnet says, "Maybe"

How many dogs does it take to change a light bulb?


         1. Golden Retriever: The sun is shining, the day is young, we've got our whole lives ahead of us, and you're inside worrying about a stupid burned out bulb?   
         2. Border Collie: Just one. And then I'll replace any wiring that's not up to code.   
         3. Dachshund: You know I can't reach that stupid lamp!   
         4. Rottweiler: Make me.   
         5. Boxer: Who cares? I can still play with my squeaky toys in the dark.   
         6. Lab: Oh, me, me!!!!! Pleeeeeeeeeze let me change the light bulb! Can I? Can I? Huh? Huh? Huh? Can I? Pleeeeeeeeeze, please, please, please!   
         7. German Shepherd: I'll change it as soon as I've led these people from the dark, check to make sure I haven't missed any, and make just one more perimeter patrol to see that no one has tried to take advantage of the situation.   
         8. Jack Russell Terrier: I'll just pop it in while I'm bouncing off the walls and furniture.   
         9. Old English Sheep Dog: Light bulb? I'm sorry, but I don't see a light bulb!   
         10. Cocker Spaniel: Why change it? I can still pee on the carpet in the dark.   
         11. Chihuahua: Yo quiero Taco Bulb. Or "We don't need no stinking light bulb."   
         12. Greyhound: It isn't moving. Who cares?   
         13. Australian Shepherd: First, I'll put all the light bulbs in a little circle...   
         14. Poodle: I'll just blow in the Border Collie's ear and he'll do it. By the time he finishes rewiring the house, my nails will be dry.   
    How many cats does it take to change a light bulb?




      Cats do not change light bulbs. People change light bulbs. So, the real question is:   
         "How long will it be before I can expect some light, some dinner, and a massage?"

How about using short-lived, unmanned inflatables as `sponges'
to deliberately soak up and remove some of that trash?  Orbit
decay and skin oxidation wouldn't hurt this application.  :-)
