Welcome to JHM -- "instead of toading you we docked you a bunch of chat points"

    This isn't a game.  It's a place where friends hang out and people 
    work on various projects.  For more information, type `help purpose'
    once you've connected.

A few useful commands:
  `connect Guest'                       to connect to a guest character.
  `@quit'                               to disconnect, either now or later.
  `connect <character-name> <password>' if you have character.
  `idle'                                to see roughly how idle JHM is.

The Park (the Clearing)
Tall oak trees tower over a small clearing in this part of the park.  There are some picnic tables and barbeque pits for social gatherings.  The grass is freshly mowed and soft to sit on.  There are patches of wildflowers growing at the bases of the trees.  A picnic table is here.  Several flowers are black and charred.  Some crop circles are here.
There is new activity on the following lists:

Remember when people used to hang out in the living room and actually be active? That was the best.

I wish I was on Waterpoint so I could finally, blissfully, ecstatically page Clay with "YEAR 2000" over and over and over and over again.

Subject:  JHM going down

Sometime in the next week or so, JHM is going down, as I'm moving.  At this time there is not a plan to bring it back up.  I've turned a copy of the db over to Ken (but please don't pester him to put it up--he's already running a MOO).  

Sorry, folks; hope to see you on Waterpoint or LambdaMOO.

Remember when we all used to hang out in the living room sitting on Jay, pushing people out the window and making word play?  That was the best.
