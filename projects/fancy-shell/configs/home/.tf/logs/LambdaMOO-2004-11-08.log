Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

lambda.moo.mud.org works, but new.lambda.moo.mud.org doesn't.

Yes; we're getting ready for The Move Back.  Thus, 

   old.lambda.moo.mud.org
     is where it is now, 
and 
   new.lambda.moo.mud.org  
     is where it's *going* to be, 
     and since there's nothing there yet, 
     well,... surprise.

Well all right, there *is* stuff at the new IP (e.g., I moved DNS [ns.lambda.moo.mud.org] last night), just no moo.

I'll also note that when the time comes, I will have to physically put the box in the car and drive it from place to place; it's about a 15 minute trip.  So there *will* be downtime.  Sorry...

Seriously, Rog, thank you for all the work you're doing to get things running smoothly again.

Hey Rog, thanks for keeping us all updated and going through all this to keep us happy... we like happy!

I just want to double check some info to make sure I understand it and have it right.
The new address will be :    ns.lambda.moo.mud.org 8888?
This will happen when?

No.  

Just keep using 'lambda.moo.mud.org' as always.  

The DNS entry (which maps 'lambda.moo.mud.org' to the correct IP address) is supposed to change on its own when the time is right.  

Now, it *MIGHT* happen that the DNS server for your own computer/subnet will turn out to be broken in some way or otherwise (for whatever reason) not be fully following the protocol and timing-out its cache entries when it's supposed to.  Meaning 'lambda.moo.mud.org' might (for you) continue to point to the old IP for a while longer than it's supposed to.  In THAT case (and ONLY that case) you should try 'new.lambda.moo.mud.org', and ONLY until such time as 'lambda.moo.mud.org' starts working again for you --- which I imagine, even in the worst cases, will be a day at the most.

If all goes well, I'll be getting rid of the 'new.lambda.moo.mud.org' entry after a week or so.


As for 'NS.lambda.moo.mud.org', you should just forget that name exists unless you care a whole lot about the actual mechanics of DNS itself.   That's the IP address for the name-server, which NEED NOT AND DOES NOT have ANYTHING to do with the moo-server.  In fact, the two servers run on separate machines (and have ALWAYS done so --- that they can be made to appear at the same IP address has to do with Stupid Firewall Tricks...)

Thanks for all the info Rog!  Good to have a place for all of us that like 
more info about what's goin on rather than less.

And yes, three cheers to you for getting things back towards normal.  Sounded
quite painful getting us there!  Too bad Covad messed up so thoroughly.
