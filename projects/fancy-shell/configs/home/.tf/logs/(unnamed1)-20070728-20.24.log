Do you really want to shut down the server in 2 minutes? [Enter `yes' or `no']
Aborted.

@SHUTDOWN
=========

Syntax:  @shutdown [<text>]

This is the friendly way to do a server shutdown; it arranges for the actual shutdown to take place two minutes hence.  Shutdown is preceded by a sequence of warnings to all connected players.  Warnings are likewise given to all players who connect during this time.  <text>, if given is included in these warning messages, perhaps as an explanation for why the server is being shut down.

Shutdown may be aborted at any time by using @abort-shutdown.
