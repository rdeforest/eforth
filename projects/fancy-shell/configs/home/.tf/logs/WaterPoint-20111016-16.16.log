A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is cool.  The coastal path continues to the south and north.
You see a quicksilver pez here.

EMAIL
=====

The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from other players.  It provides commands to view and manage your own collection of saved messages and, in addition, to browse through other collections that may be available (e.g.,archives of public mailing lists).  Help is available on the following commands:

@mail       [1]
      seeing a table of contents for a collection of email messages
@read       [2]
      reading individual messages 
@next       [3]
      reading the 'next'     message
@prev       [4]
      reading the 'previous' message

@send       [5]
      composing and sending a message to other players
@answer     [6]
      replying to one of the messages in a collection
@forward    [7]
      resending one of the messages in a collection somewhere else
@forward-me [8]
      resending a message to your email address

@rmmail     [9]
      discarding some subset of a collection
@unrmmail   [10]
      undoing the most recent @rmm on a collection
@renumber   [11]
      renumbering the messages in a collection

@mail-option[12]
      describing and setting various customization flags

For viewing collections other from your own, the following commands are useful:

@rn         [13]
      list those collections that have new messages on them
@subscribe  [14]
      indicate that you want @rn to report on a given collection and add yourself to its .mail_notify list
@skip       [15]
      ignore any remaining new messages in a given collection
@unsubscribe[16]
      ignore a given collection entirely from now on and remove yourself from its .mail_notify list

Two other related topics:

mail-forwarding[17]
      describes mail forwarding
message-sequences[18]
      describes message-sequences arguments to @mail, @read, @rmm, and @answer.

@REGISTER
=========

Usage:  @register [<someone>]
        @register <someone> as <email-address>[ <commentary>]

Check or update an email address.

The first form just tells you the person's email address.  It works only if you are that person or are on the community group (see `help cg'[1]), or if the person has made eir address public (with `@miscoption +public_email').  It may also tell you about others registered to the same address.

The second form will change the database entry, assign a new password, and mail the new password to the given email address.

Most people can only register themselves, and can't provide commentary (additional text that's stored with the email address).  Community group members can register others and add comments.

This is different from the @request/@register command for guests.

Your email address is robert@defore.st (Reregistered at Mon Sep 30 12:03:27 2002 PDT by Jay (#201)).

(Use `@register <someone> as <address>' to set an email address.)
The system needs to compare connect site with address, and can't resolve the connect site.
Automatic registration not allowed.  Talk to a member of the Community Group (see `help Community-Group') if you want to register for this address anyway.
