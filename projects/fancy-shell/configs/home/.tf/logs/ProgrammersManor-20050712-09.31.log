China hears patter of tiny panda paws--16 of them
Tue Jul 12, 2005 10:31 AM ET

BEIJING (Reuters) - China has had a double summer surprise with two pairs of twin pandas born at a remote and foggy mountain reserve.

Guo Guo, seven years old and a first-time mother, gave birth to two cubs Friday at the Wolong panda reserve in southwest Sichuan province a week after her neighbor, Ying Ying, had twins, Xinhua news agency said.

"Under our experts' 24-hour wardship, the mother panda and her baby cubs have safely passed 'the first three post-delivery risky days'," Li Desheng, assistant director of the reserve, was quoted as saying of Guo guo.

Guo Guo appeared flustered by her crying cubs at first and reserve staff had to intervene when she accidentally dropped one of her babies the day they were born, Xinhua said.

The Wolong reserve is one of the few places in the world that has had consistent success expanding its population of pandas, which are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.

More than 70 panda cubs had been born at the reserve, 61 of which had survived, state media previously reported.

The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with fewer than 1,600 living in the wild in western China.

He paused.  Blinked.  Shuddered.  Then said:  OK, you're right, that's
terrifying.

U.S., Japan say N.Korea must end nuclear ambitions
Tue Jul 12, 2005 08:05 AM ET

By Jack Kim and Teruaki Ueno

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and the United States urged Pyongyang on Tuesday to abandon nuclear weapons or risk failure in six-nation talks, while South Korea offered to supply its reclusive neighbor with electricity in return for a deal.

Communist North Korea has agreed to return to negotiations on its nuclear ambitions with the United States, host China, Japan, South Korea and Russia. The meeting -- the first since June 2004 -- will be held in the week of July 25.

"What we really need is a strategic decision on the part of the North that they are indeed ready to give up nuclear weapons because, without that, these talks cannot be successful," Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a news conference in Tokyo.

"Just having a meeting is meaningless. If you don't make any progress, there is no point," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters at his residence after his meeting with Rice.

Rice arrived from Tokyo in Seoul for the final leg of a four-nation Asian trip. As she arrived, South Korea said it would supply 2 million kilowatts of power -- roughly the capacity of two large nuclear power plants -- directly to the North if it agreed to end its nuclear weapons programs.

Reviving the talks has become more urgent because of concerns Pyongyang has expanded its nuclear capabilities to eight or more weapons, up from one or two weapons when President Bush came to office in 2001.

Underlining the flurry of diplomacy, Chinese State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan, a special envoy of President Hu Jintao, headed for North Korea earlier on Tuesday.

U.S. officials said earlier that North Korea was calling a nuclear-free Korean peninsula the "dying wish" of its late leader, Kim Il-sung, and this might be a way for Pyongyang to explain its decision to return to talks. But they said there were no concrete signs that the North would surrender its capability.

Still, after several years of seeking to isolate Pyongyang, Rice said the Bush administration was "absolutely willing to negotiate seriously."

Experts say that for the talks to succeed, the five parties other than North Korea must stay united. Officials from Japan, South Korea and the United States will meet in Seoul on Thursday to coordinate their approach.

CARROTS AND STICKS

Differences over what mix of carrots and sticks to use in dealing with Pyongyang have plagued the six-party process.

Prior to its power supply pledge, South Korea said it would give 500,000 tonnes of rice to the North to help battle a severe food shortage. Seoul and Pyongyang have recently stepped up bilateral contacts.

Military officials from South and North Korea will have a rare meeting next week aimed at building trust among militaries that face each other across the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.

The Bush administration has long opposed giving incentives before the North commits to abandoning its nuclear programs and it previously urged allies to withhold huge new aid infusions.

But Rice endorsed Seoul's aid pledge and noted Washington had itself recently promised Pyongyang 50,000 tonnes of food in aid.

At the third round of talks, in June 2004, the United States proposed fuel aid and security guarantees to North Korea if it gave up its nuclear weapons programs.

While insisting Washington would offer no new incentives to bring Pyongyang back to the table, Rice and other officials now say the 2004 proposal is just a starting position and there is room to alter its terms once serious negotiations start.

Japan, for its part, wants to raise the issue of the abduction of its citizens by North Korea decades ago. Pyongyang says the matter is closed, and both Beijing and Seoul want it to be dealt with separately.

Rice agreed that abductions, as well as the North's missile proliferation and human rights record, must be dealt before relations can advance. But the nuclear weapons issue is "the one that is pressing us in terms of the (six-party) talks," she said.

The North's KCNA news agency said Pyongyang had armed itself with nuclear weapons in response to a U.S. threat but "we do not intend to possess nuclear weapons forever."

However, former Pentagon official Daniel Bluemthal said in Washington that "Pyongyang's nuclear aspirations go to the core of the regime's raison d'etre -- ensuring its own survival and forcefully unifying the peninsula under its control" and hence it was unlikely that they would be surrendered.

Crag says, "work is st00pid"
Crag says, "My day is not getting any better."
Crag says, "I wanted to smash Andrew in the face just now."
Crag says, "I feel sick"
Crag says, "but not physically"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "gah"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry"
stormagnet says, "Was lunch at least tasty?"
Crag says, "meh"
Crag says, "It was disappointing"
stormagnet says, "aww"
stormagnet says, "What did Andrew do/say?"
Crag says, "I've been trying to get people to give me feedback on our team wiki for two years.  Nothing.  The SOC has a fancy (non-wiki) web page now, and Andrew suggested getting TSS added to it.  I said, why wait for them to add us?  Let's just use the wiki.  He said it doesn't LOOK AS GOOD."
Crag says, "It's A WIKI"
Crag says, "If you don't like it, FIX IT"
Crag says, "I feel like I'm screaming into a pillow or something."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Tell me what to do, and I'll do it!"
stormagnet says, "That's a good analogy"
Crag says, "Just somebody tell me!"
Crag says, "And don't say, "let's get someone else to do it.""
stormagnet says, "Then they would have to think of what they want you to do"
stormagnet says, "And tell you"
Crag says, "He was proposing telling the SOC documentor what he wants"
Crag says, "god I'm pissed"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "This on top of Jason insinuating that I don't take pride in my work"
Crag says, "The whole problem is that I do!"
Crag says, "And I can't leave early because I've been coming in late for over a week."
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "irony"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "It hurts even more coming from Andrew"
Crag says, "He was the one person I thought was on my side."
stormagnet says, "I think people are afraid of the wiki making more work for them"
Crag says, "They could just tell me what they want"
stormagnet says, "They want it to be Somebody Else's Problem"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It could be my problem!"
Crag says, "It was supposed to be!"
stormagnet says, "They don't trust that, though"
Crag says, "Mike appointed me Wiki Evangelist"
Crag says, "why?"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "What are they afraid of?"
Crag says, "That someone will ask them to do their jobs?"
stormagnet says, "Because it's based on a principal of shared participation"
stormagnet says, "They're probably afraid that participation will be another obligation on their already-full plate"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'm sure you're right"
stormagnet says, "Knowing WDIG, it could easily turn into that, too"
Crag says, "Hm, interestingly enough, Jason followed up to Andrew's "it doesn't look good enough" with:"
Crag | Umm.. I don.t think this really needs to happen soon. Let stay focused on getting procedures documented (and followed). Then we can worry about what it looks like.
stormagnet says, "Which is an excellent point"
Crag says, "yeah, I'm kinda surprised"
stormagnet says, "Which proves the value of being able to reconcile hypocrisy"
stormagnet laughs
Crag smiles.
stormagnet says, "After chiro, I was thinking along the lines of KotR, quesadillas, and chili"
stormagnet says, "Does that sound appealling?"
stormagnet fishes for a carrot
Crag says, "I guess so"
stormagnet appeels the carrot
stormagnet . o O ( damn, those crickets sure are loud )
Crag heh
Crag says, "I also still have no idea why wrack rebooted twice this morning."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That was weird"
Crag says, "I'm building a custom kernel to remove module support as a security enhancement."
stormagnet says, "None of the clocks reset or anything, so I doubt it was an outage"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I don't know that we're necessarily breeched, and if we are the kernel upgrade won't help, but it was soemthing to do while I stress."
Crag says, "A hardware problem would more likely lead to a hang than a reboot"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Heat?"
stormagnet says, "It *was* pretty hot last night"
stormagnet says, "I remember waking up and kicking off the blankets a lot"
Crag says, "I can't rule it out, but I would still expect it to hang rather than reboot"
stormagnet says, "CPU heat detectors reboot when it gets too hot"
stormagnet says, "ALL THE TIME"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet shakes her fist at her laptop
Crag heh
Crag says, "Yeah, maybe that was it."
Crag says, "need to get Ildana online soon."
stormagnet says, "It seems the most plausible"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Most plausible?  Or least unlikely? :)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "How about the weekend after this one?"
Crag says, "maybe"
stormagnet says, ":nods"
stormagnet says, "MEH"
Crag says, "I want to go on a trip too though"
stormagnet says, "There is that"
Crag says, "aw crap, so what are we going to do about junx"
Crag says, "fly or bike?"
stormagnet says, "Have you had a chance to talk to Jay?"
Crag says, "oh yeah, I forgot."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I don't even know if I have his number.  I'll mail him now."
stormagnet says, "There are one way tickets on Alaska for $84 each"
stormagnet says, "Departing on the evening of the 10th"
stormagnet says, "For SeaTac to Oakland"
Crag says, "Ok, I emailed Jay"
Crag says, "one way?"
Crag says, "You're not thinking to ride the shadow back are you?"
Crag says, "Oh, rent truck"
Crag says, "i remember now :)"
Crag says, "$84 is pretty good"
Crag says, "So that's $168+tax to fly down..."
Crag says, "I wonder how much the truck is"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "uhaul is $1/mile in-town"
Crag says, "So unless it's a lot less for long distance, that probably won't work for us."
stormagnet says, "Their motorcycle trailers are cheaper"
stormagnet says, "So we could rent a truck at a car rental place instead"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "That might just work"
stormagnet says, "Oh, crap"
Crag says, "It wouldn't even be necessary to fix the bike then"
stormagnet says, "Local only, it says, on the motorcycle trailer"
Crag says, "aw man"
stormagnet peers around more
Crag says, "Meh, I can't even leave on time today.  The parts guy is coming in half an hourt."
Crag says, "I already had my leather pants on!"
Crag says, "NOT MY FREAKIN' DAY"
stormagnet says, "FUCKER"
stormagnet says, "AHA"
stormagnet says, "Yes"
stormagnet says, "There is a trailer we could rent from UHAUL and hitch to a rental truck for a grand total of about $400"
stormagnet says, "Also"
stormagnet says, "Do you think we could load the shadow into the back of a minivan or SUV?"
stormagnet says, "If so, that would eliminate the need to rent a trailer entirely"
Crag says, "It wouldn't fit in a van or SUV"
Crag says, "too tall."
Crag sighs.
Crag says, "what a pin."
Crag says, "pain, even"
stormagnet says, "Do you have a height measurement/estimate?"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "Because some of these are HUGE"
stormagnet can check in listed specs
Crag says, "I'm not very good with sizes"
Crag says, "I don't even know if it's taller than Katie."
Crag says, "Maybe I could look it up online."
Crag says, "We might be able to take the windshield off, which would help."
Crag says, "Maybe I could get Jay to measure it."
Crag says, "If I don't get a reply from him today I'll call him."
stormagnet says, "What about the back of a pickup truck?"
stormagnet says, "Enterprise has pickup trucks for rental, and it says that they are willing the negotiate 1-way rentals"
Crag says, "That would work."
Crag says, "It would require a lot of strapping, of course."
stormagnet says, "w00t!"
stormagnet says, "Ok, I have our solution, then :)"
stormagnet says, "ooh, we got Netflix in the mail :)"
Crag says, "I'm heading home now."
