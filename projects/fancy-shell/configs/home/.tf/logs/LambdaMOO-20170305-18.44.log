always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.

Storage room
Boxes, crates scrapes of stuff, and the desicated remains of a rat are all strewn about this small room. There is dusteverywhere... at least you hope that's dust. There's a hammock strung between two walls and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light.

You note that the 60 watt incandescent bulb implies that the owner ther doesn't care about the environment, or hasn't changed anything since incandescent lights became hard to come by.

Some mild lag has returned.  I know about the commands to list the various lags, but does the server have the ability to identify what the higher impact verbs are?

What you want to do is ``@refuse flames from #41111'', but right now the @refuse command won't work with anything other than a player. I think there are some Player Classes that offer a customized @refuse that'll let you do this. Here's a patch for the core that allows you to @refuse anything if you use the ``@refuse!'' command.

*** refuse-orig 
--- refuse-new  
***************
*** 1,2 ****
! @verb $frand_class:"@ref*use" any any any
! @program $frand_class:@refuse
--- 1,2 ----
! @verb $frand_class:"@ref*use!" any any any
! @program $frand_class:@refuse!
***************
*** 9,12 ****
  if (stuff)
!   if (((typeof(who = stuff[1]) == OBJ) && (who != $nothing)) && (!is_player(who)))
      player:tell("You must give the name of some player.");
    else
--- 9,13 ----
  if (stuff)
!   if (((verb != "@refuse!") && ((typeof(who = stuff[1]) == OBJ) && (who != $nothing))) && (!is_player(who)))
      player:tell("You must give the name of some player.");
+     player:tell("If you're sure you want to refuse an object, type ``@refuse! ", argstr, "''");
    else
