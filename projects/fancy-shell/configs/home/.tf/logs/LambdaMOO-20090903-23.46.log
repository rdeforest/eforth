Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

That's an interesting idea, but you'd have to revisit the decision from the advent of FLOAT that intentionally does not permit automatic promotion.  If you introduced a BIGNUM type that couldn't mix with FLOAT or NUM you could end up with some atrocious syntax.

Has anyone started a lambdamoo repo on github?

We have a repo on http://codepoint.the-b.org/ for Codepoint that includes 64-bit integers (and, by extension, objnums) that's part of the general tree for our Unicode extensions. Most of it was written by hpa.

Subject:  Bigger NUMs

As an armchair server hacker, it seems like it would be more graceful to add a new type BIGNUM and hook it into libgmp.  You wouldn't have to worry about breaking any MOO code which assumes NUMs wrap around at 2**31 (you know it's out there) and you would just be adding another pointer to the Var.v union so you don't have to worry about alignment.

There are a lot of Vars in memory for a running server, which is why an effort was made to keep the size down.  You can make all of the int types (as you observed, you'll want to do ALL of them) into 64 bit at the cost of some memory.  At that point you could make float a non-ref type with no penalty.  The harder part is going to be finding all of the OTHER places in the server that say 'int32' when they mean 'type of Var.num', along with constant like MAXINT and so on.  So, for example, dbio_read_num() will load your "legacy" database full of 32 bit values, and then you might run fine, but until you modify something like dbio_write_num() to be 64 bit you won't be able to save your db if it has any 64-bit values.
--------------------------
I don't understand that.
