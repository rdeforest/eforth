This incredibly expensive software only does what it's advertised to do in sales meetings.

It wastes money: after a client is removed from the main config, its savesets are no longer automatically expired.

It wastes time: when doing a directed recover from the command line, the user is not informed when they don't have permission to perform a restore.  Instead the client just 'sits there', apparently trying to perform the restore and silently failing.
Moved.
That is not a valid command.
