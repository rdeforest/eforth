enceladus grins.
enceladus says, "so what will this client side editing allow us to edit?"
Crag says, "It makes it so I can use vi to edit notes and code"
Crag says, "What MOO client do you use?"
enceladus says, "simplemu. i'm on 'doze"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Do you know if it supports MCP?"
Crag says, "MCP is the MUD Client Protocol"
enceladus says, "it does MCCP but not MCP"
Crag says, "I don't know what MCCP is"
enceladus says, "apparently it's text compression"
Crag says, "Interesting"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "If you switch to an MCP client you can turn on local editing and use your favorite Windows editor to edit text on the MOO"
enceladus nods.
Crag says, "It's great because I can edit this note while I'm talking to you"
Crag says, "And as you know, the MOO editor is pretty old-fashioned and awkward"
enceladus says, "i may at some point if get back into coding MOO heavily again."
Crag says, "That's what I'm hoping. :)"
Crag says, "If you want a client recommendation, I've heard Trebuchet is great: http://www.belfry.com/fuzzball/trebuchet/faq.html"

HELP
====

Syntax:  help
         help <topic>
         help index

Print out entries from the online documentation system.  The commands `?' and `information' (usually abbreviated `info') are synonyms for `help'.

The first form prints out a summary table of contents for the entire help system.  

The second form prints out the documentation available on the given topic.  Many help system entries contain references to other entries accessible in this way.  The topic name may be abbreviated; if there is no topic exactly matching the name you give, the help system checks for topics for which the name is a prefix, perhaps with the addition or omission of an initial `@', or perhaps with some confusion beween dashes (-) and underscores (_), e.g., 

      `bui' instead of `building', 
      `who' instead of `@who', 
     `@wri' instead of `write',
  `add_ent' instead of `@add-entrance',
 `unlock-'  instead of `@unlock_for_open'

If the abbreviation you give is ambiguous, you will be presented with a list of the matching complete topic names.

The `help index'[1] commands prints out a list of indices for the various help databases.  Each index gives a list of topics available on that database.  It is sometimes easier to find the topics you're interested in this way, rather than tracing through the chain of cross references.

For programmers, the help system provides the following additional forms:

  help object:verbname   -- prints any documentation strings that are present
                            at the beginning of the program for that verb.
  help $<whatever>_utils -- prints general information about one of the 
                            $..._utils objects (e.g., $string_utils, 
                            $list_utils, etc...), which are all libraries 
                            of generally used verbs.
  help builtin()         -- prints documentation from the programmers manual
                            about the named primitive, for example length()

For information about how the help system itself works and about how to associate local help databases with specific rooms or player classes, see `help $help'[2].

POINT
=====

You're not cleared for that.

ADMIN
=====

There are three separate (but not necessarily disjoint) groups of administrators, with different roles and responsibilities.  You can get help about each of the following groups, listed here with a brief explanation of what it is they're responsible for.

steering-committee[1]
      defining and maintaining the MOO's goals and objectives
tech-group[2]
      technical development and maintenance of the MOO
community-group[3]
      handling social problems and promoting a sense of community

By defining the responsibilities of the various types of administrators, we hope to clear up any confusion about what a person `in charge' is supposed to be doing, and what authority that person has.

    enormous building surrounded by groomed property and a large wall.
    The time period could be somewhere between 1400CE and a little
    past the present, and the place could be anywhere in the western
    world.  The weather is mild.  There are no vehicals.

Mood:

    The MOO itself should be friendly at all times.  There is a
    currently a generic butcher knife with which to stab people, but
    you should only do so in a friendly way.  Victims who are mortally
    wounded will find themselves suddenly transported to The Heavens,
    but they need only join someone or walk somewhere to be
    re-incarnated.

Building:

    If you want to add to the MOO, please try to make your additions
    as seamless as possible.  For example, if you want to add a
    vehical, it should be something which would not be out of place
    int his setting, like a horse-drawn cart.  If you want to build a
    room of your own, it needs to be attached to the rest of the
    world, and in a way which 'makes sense'.  A gazebo would be
    appropriate, and a space ship would not.

If you have any questions, mail the Comstruction and Maintenance
mailing list, or *cam for short.

The Programmer's Manor Theme notes (#1150) recycled.
The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  There are some easy chairs pushed up against the walls, one on either side of the north and south doors.
Minty is here, daydreaming.  enceladus is dozing.  stormagnet is off in another world.

Message 1 on *Bug-reports:
Date:     Sat Jan 29 18:41:00 2005 PST
From:     Crag
To:       *Bug-reports
Subject:  relativity and internal compasses

The players orientation and location in space will be tracked.  Scenery descriptions will be rendered in terms of the players physical situation.  The cardinal directions will become 'forward', 'left', 'right', etc.
--------------------------
Message 2 on *Bug-reports:
Date:     Sat Jan 29 18:48:05 2005 PST
From:     Crag
To:       *Bug-reports
Subject:  sense and sensitivity

The obverservational processes will be refined so that the player is only given information they would be likely to receive in light of how perceptive they are and how hard they are trying to perceive.  All five senses will be implemented independently.  Information will be brought to the player gradually as they experience it, rather than being dumped on them when they enter a room.

> forward
You proceed through the door.  This room is unfamiliar.  On your left some people who are talking turn to see you enter.
>
Ahead of you is a door.
>
On your right a fireplace contains a blazing, crackling fireplace.  The room smells faintly of the burning wood.
>look people
You recognize Jacque and Ida.  They are well dressed and smiling.

Etc.

The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.
enceladus is here, dozing.  stormagnet is off in another world.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the Ballroom.
Crag has arrived.
Crag says, "This is the room new people show up in, obviously"
Minty whews!
Crag says, "South of here is the front of the building..."
The Front Porch
This is the front porch of the enormous Prauge-Rhammer Manor. The porch is covered by a roof some twenty feet above you, supported by enormous columns. Enormous wooden doors dominate the middle of the porch, and the sides are rounded towards building at the sides, making a shallow semi-circle of the porch. There are some half-dozen large steps down to the circle drive below. Facing the drive, there is a service road to the right which turns around the side of the Manor.
Minty follows Crag.

West (#861) leads to the South West Lawn (#860) via {west, w}.
East (#884) leads to the South East Lawn (#853) via {east, e}.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "The way off the property would be south from here, but that doesn't exist yet."
The South West Lawn
You are in front of the manor. To the west is the circular driveway where guests stop to disembark. A road runs through this area and to the north. To the south and west you can see the great wall which encircles the property.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the Circular Driveway.
Crag says, "There's a road here which is how the Manor would take deliveries, if there ever were any."
You can't go that way.
East (#862) leads to the Circular Driveway (#857) via {east, e}.
North (#864) leads to the West Lawn (#863) via {north, n}.
The West Lawn
You are between the manor to the east, and the great encircling wall to the west. A road runs down into a closed garage under the manor, and to the south. To the north you see more wall and some forest.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the South West Lawn.
South (#865) leads to the South West Lawn (#860) via {south, s}.
North (#867) leads to the North West Lawn (#866) via {north, n}.
Minty says, "Cool!"
Crag says, "The road is only in the descriptions though"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "There isn't actually a way into the basement here yet"
The North West Lawn
You are north west of the manor. To the west the great wall stretches north into forest and south past the manor. To the east you see the hedgemaze which guards the manor pool and the rear entrances to the manor. Farther north you see trees which thinken into a dense forest.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the West Lawn.
Crag says, "The wall to the west is enormous.  It's two stories tall and like 10-15 feet thick"
Crag says, "It might have secret passages ;)"
South (#868) leads to the West Lawn (#863) via {south, s}.
East (#882) leads to the West Veranda (#404) via {east, e, veranda}.
North (#869) leads to the Light Forest (#877) via {north, n}.
Crag says, "To the east of here is the veranda which connects to the ballroom"
Minty says, "Ahhh, you've been busy!"
Crag says, "And if you keep going east and south it loops back around to the driveway "
Crag says, "We did all this over a year ago"
Crag says, "I was very sad when I thought we'd lost it all"
Minty says, "Ohhh"
The Light Forest
All around you are young trees encroaching on the residents at the manor below. You hear a creek nearby. Further into the forest the foliage is far thicker, blocking the view. From where you stand you can still see the great wall which surrounds the Manor, and you guess that way is west.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the North West Lawn.
Crag says, "This forest has a secret..."
South (#870) leads to the North West Lawn (#866) via {south, s}.
North (#874) leads to the Dense Forest (#872) via {north, n}.
The Dense Forest
Thick-bodied trees rise to epic heights and block out most light.  The trees seem to thin out to the south and to the north you see some twinkling lights.  Trees block passage in other directions.
You see a Bluegum Eucalyptus here.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the Light Forest.
Minty gasps!
Crag says, "Somewhere around here..."
Standing over a hundred feet tall with a wide trunk, it lacks low limbs for easy climbing.
Minty says, "A secret??"
Crag says, "yes..."
South (#873) leads to the Light Forest (#877) via {south, s}.
The clearing (#876) leads to the Forest Clearing (#879) via {clearing, n, north}.
The Forest Clearing
The forest opens in to a clearing.  There's a house built of an unusual tan substance, akin to bread in the center of this space.  To the west, there's a colorful round building surrounded by trees and woodland flowers.  A small hole sits before the house.  A patch of lolipops sprout like flowers in a bed.  A topiary of dark chocolate is prominently displayed.  A tree stump is here.  A tree stump too is here.  To the south, a path leads through the dense forest.  Stepping stones of gumdrops lead up to an arched doorway which is trimmed in icing.  The screen door to the Yurt is closed.
You see a Thin Kamani and a Thick Kamani here.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the Dense Forest.
Minty says, "Hrm"
Crag says, "ahh, here we go"
Crag says, "You may remember the user PG or 'Pig Girl'"
Crag says, "She likes food a lot and wanted to have a gingerbread house"
Minty says, "Chocolate!!"
Minty drools.
Crag says, "That wouldn't have fit into the theme very well, so I setup a spot for her in the forest."
Minty says, "awww"
Crag says, "basically, anything anyone can come up with, we can probably squeeze in eventually, with some imagination."
Minty nods.
Crag says, "The story here is that it's not REALLY a gingerbread house... or is it?!"
Crag grins.
Minty giggles.
Crag says, "It might all be fake, or it might be magic."
Crag says, "That's sorta the ongoing theme."
Minty grins.
Minty nods.
Crag says, "It's supposed to be more subtle, but we haven't spent much energy on it yet"
Crag says, "But otherwise it's little more than magical realism."
The out (#871) leads to the Dense Forest (#872) via {out, s, south}.
The house (#880) leads to the The Gingerbread House Foyer (#878) via {house, enter, in, doorway, arched}.
The screen door (#1049) leads to the Yurt (#1050) via {screen door, west, w, door, yurt}.
Minty says, "you've been busy people though."
Crag says, "We were"
Crag says, "There used to be people logged in all the time."
Minty nods.
Crag says, "PG, Binder, Davil Crayon"
Minty says, "Yep"
The The Gingerbread House Foyer
Foyer in PG's Gingerbread house, illuminated by an ornate chandelier. In front of you a large vase of fresh flowers. A silver gilded mirror is on the floor leaning against a wall waiting to be hung. The smell of Spring envelopes you. Exits: Out (Outside), Door (to Parlor), Hallway_right (to Kitchen).
You see a Salad, a Salad container, and a Punching Bag for Binder here.
PG is here, asleep.
Minty follows Crag.

Crag says, "All this is PG's doing"
Minty says, "Colin hasn't been around lately though, eh?"
Crag says, "The MOO was dead for a long time"
Crag says, "I have talked to him though"
Minty nods.

That is not a valid command.
The Light Forest
All around you are young trees encroaching on the residents at the manor below. You hear a creek nearby. Further into the forest the foliage is far thicker, blocking the view. From where you stand you can still see the great wall which surrounds the Manor, and you guess that way is west.

West (#881) leads to the North West Lawn (#866) via {west, w, out}.
The Western Fireplace
You are beside the western fireplace, at the northern end of the ballroom. An elevator is to the north.  A huge brick fireplace is set into the center of the wall.  A soft red rug lies under your feet.  A pair of dark green sofas face each other across the fireplace, with a coffee table standing between them.
Minty follows Crag.
Minty arrives from the West Veranda.
Crag says, "And now we're back inside."
Minty yays!
Crag says, "So that's the quick tour"
Minty says, "All this is way cool!"
Crag says, "There's a lot more on paper that isn't in the MOO, besides the descriptions"
Minty says, "Yep, it was quick ;)"
Crag says, "THe grounds are much larger than all that"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "In the courners are turrets, there's more forest, there's a hedgemaze containing a swimming pool, and a gazebo."
Minty says, "Wow!"
Crag says, "Also, the grounds slope gently up towards the north east, with the implication that we're at the base of a mountain."
Minty says, "Ahhhh"
Crag says, "There's a creek that runs around the manor and its tapped upstream to feed water to us."
Crag says, "All of this is just in my mind and written down right now, but eventually it's going into the MOO."
Minty says, "Cool!"
Crag says, "The reason I wanted to show you all this"
Crag says, "Is that as someone who'se likely to be online as much as me, and who will be bringing people here, I want you to empart the theme to them too"
Crag says, "I want to make sure that the feeling of the MOO is consistant"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I'm not the pushy type to make people do things my way, but I like things to be smooth"
Minty says, "Exactly"
Crag says, "So your main responsibility as a Wizard(ess) is to pass this information on and help people out as best you can."
Minty grins.
Minty nods.
Crag says, "In return, you have a new MOO to replace that old sjr dump :)"
Minty yays!
Crag says, "The only thing I'm afraid of is that people will just cut-n-paste code from other MOOs here"
Crag says, "I want to encourage people to do original work and try to stick with the style of the MOO"
Minty says, "I wouldn't."
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I'm not worried about you"
Crag says, "I'm worried about people showing up later and doing it"
Crag says, "I don't want "bonking" features and sophmoric humor about sex and drugs."
Minty says, "Basically what we use copy and paste for is *qooc and things that we might get in our emails, like jokes to copy and paste to the *bb.. at least that's what we did in sjr."
Crag says, "Well yeah"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I was specifically thinking of copy-n-paste programming"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "There are a lot of MOOs with very badly written features and toys"
Crag says, "And it would be trivial to bring them here"
Minty says, "I doubt you have to worry about that."
Crag says, "cool"
Crag says, "I also don't want to stifle people"
Minty says, "Coz sjr was a social moo for us."
Minty nods.
Crag says, "I'm a little elitist about programming, and I don't want that to discourage anyone"
Crag says, "Most MOOs are social"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "it's what they do best."
Crag says, "But I want this to be more than that too, as you can tell."
Minty nods.

Crag says, "But they have to be low-stress, like the stabbing game"
Minty nods.
Crag says, "so that's about it."
Minty says, "cool, sounds good to me!"
Crag says, "Since you're helping me out so much, please feel free to email me if I'm gone to long."
Minty says, "okie"
Crag says, "You should feel free to email me anyway, but in particular, you should be demanding"
Minty giggles.
Crag says, "Or at least have some expectations of me"
Crag says, "I'm a bit of a slacker and forgetful and stuff"
Minty grins.
Crag says, "But I want you and your friends to have fun here"
Crag says, "ANd I know that means I need to participate"
Minty says, "We will!"
