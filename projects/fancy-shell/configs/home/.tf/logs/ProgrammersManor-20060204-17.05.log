Binder         Entrance Hall                 3 hours     This Week in Review.  

Total: 4 people, 1 of whom has been active recently.
Binder stabs Crag with a TheraSense FreeStyle.  Neat!
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag says, "That showed me!"
Binder [to Crag]: I knew you were just pretending to be idle.
[with the ice pick]
Crag stabs Binder with an ice pick.  Neat!
Crag says, "I wasn't really pretending, even"
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag laughs
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Crag says, "nice"
Binder grins.
[with the ice pick]
Crag slashes at Binder, but Binder ducks the attack.
Crag says, "AH"
Crag [to Binder]: well played.
Binder bows.
Binder went to the comic shop.
Crag [to Binder]: I'm spending more time on documentation now
Crag says, "Woo, comics!"
Binder says, "Then I went to the Albany Bowl."
Crag says, "Bowling?"
Binder says, "Then I came home and nuked Fish's account."
Crag says, "Ah, so that was for real then"
Binder says, "Well, that was the plan but I didn't feel like it after the swarms of children."
Crag says, "I thought i was some sort of inside joke"
Binder says, "Maybe he thinks it is."
Crag . o O ( i am some sort of inside joke? )
Crag . o O ( it )
Crag [to Binder]: I never liked him
Binder shrugs.
Binder  neither.
Crag says, "Not that that necessarily counts for anything"
Binder    adds more spaces.
Crag        too.
Binder       kind of likes the effect.
Binder says, "Anyway."
Crag          linear!
Binder says, "Documentation rules."
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "yes"
Binder broke it!
Crag [to Binder]: WHATEVER
Binder SPOILED IT ALL AGAIN.
Crag [to Binder]: the docs are getting me all hot and bothered
Binder eyes Crag.
Crag says, "but I caught myself explaining the same things over and over"
Binder says, "Once and only once."
Crag says, "And saying, "I'll write this up eventually...""
Crag says, "and then I realized I'd better do it quick :)"
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "The best eventually is the one right now."
Crag says, "And writing the HistoryOfBEM thing spared lots of ideas too"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "Especially..."
Crag says, "Right......."
Crag says, "Now!"
[with the ice pick]
Crag stabs Binder with an ice pick.  Neat!
Binder dies from a wound inflicted by Crag with the ice pick.
Binder has left.
Crag laughs and laughs
Binder arrives from the heavens.
You page Binder, "that worked out better than I expected!"
Crag [to Binder]: that worked out better than I expected!
Crag ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder snickers.
Crag says, "aheh"
Crag ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder had actually gotten up and left the room.
Crag says, "We should add a 'get back up' command and etc"
Crag laughs
Binder was shredding.
Binder loves to shred receipts and credit card offers.
Crag says, "That does sound amusing"
Crag says, "DESTROY!  DESTROY!"
Binder says, "Adding postures and logic thereof would be convolute."
Crag says, "well yes"
Binder says, "Sitting, kneeling, standing, prone."
Binder says, "Oh, I know what we need!  HIT LOCATION CHARTS!"
Crag says, "Mostly I'm thinking that after a stumble and fall a person can't immediately duck again"
Binder stabs Binder with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Crag laughs!
Binder says, "Yeah, a no-ducking recovery time."
Crag says, "And AnimalCrossingFishing-esq messages"
Binder says, "NO_DUCKING_WAY."
Crag stabs Binder in the eye!  Aye aye!
Binder says, "Anything + Animal Crossing = funny."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "yes"
Binder dithers.
Binder says, "Can't decide if I should keep working on the PVR or read comic books."
Crag says, "My sources say Yes"
Binder looks at a picture of Scarlett Johansson's nipple, instead.
Crag .
Crag . o O [ . ]
Crag . o O [ o ]
Binder says, "http://img142.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo1i-6577/loc276/9f378_scarlett_match2.jpg"
Binder says, "Misha just posted it in Prattle>."
Crag says, "Yes.  There it is."
Crag says, "through a bra AND a shirt, even"
Crag says, "stormagnet will like that."
Binder says, "SJ has superhuman nipples."
Binder says, "Armor piercing."
Crag says, "Evidently..."
Crag says, "I know _my_ armor was pierced."
Binder makes a decision and idles to read comic books.
Crag nodsnods.
Binder idles: nerdvana
Crag snickers.
Crag says, "I love that band.  That song "smells like blue smoke" is great."
Crag . o O ( or was it the magic smoke? )
Crag . o O ( whatever )
stormagnet                                                                                ...BUTTPAD
Crag . o O ( menomenon )
You hear a quiet popping sound; Ryan has disconnected.
< Ryan has disconnected.  Total: 3 >
Ryan has connected.
Crag [to Ryan]: Welcome back.  In case you didn't catch the news before, we had an 8 hour power outage yesterday.
Crag says, "good times"
Ryan says, "ah, was wondering"
Crag says, "presumably due to some sort of wind/tree/powerline interaction"
Crag says, "40,000 residents in a nearby county still have no power"
Crag says, "We had measured gusts approaching 80mph"
Crag says, "dunno what that is in kph :)"
Ryan says, "ouch"
Crag says, "Not exactly a Gulf Coast storm, or a Columbus Day Storm, but pretty exciting"
Crag [to nobody in particular]: Why does Windows use different names for everything!
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]

Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Ryan is trying desperately to find a place in Toronto that will sell these: http://www.thetwistergroup.com/store/customer/product.php?productid=200-045%20D06630&source=fr
Crag takes a look
Ryan says, "i can order from N # places on the net, but then pay shipping"
Ryan says, "when i'd just like to go into a place, drop $8 on 4 of them, and leave"
Crag says, "coax to rca adapter, hm"
Crag ponders
Ryan says, "or i could buy a soldering iron and build them myself :-("
Crag says, "home-made wouldn't be very reliabled I'd think"
Ryan found one place, way out in the suburbs
Ryan says, "times like these i realize how bad the net sux"
Crag I dunno
Crag mavs
Crag says, "I dunno"
Crag says, "It's still an improvement"
Crag says, "Do google local or yahoo yellowpages cover your area?"
Crag checks
Ryan says, "google local does, but badly"
Crag takes a look
Crag says, "Toronto, right?"
Ryan says, "yessir"
Ryan says, "I have been looking in google local... dubious value"
Crag says, "Is this any help:"
Crag | http://local.google.com/local?f=q&hl=en&q=toronto+canada+video+accessories
Ryan looks
Crag says, "There's a "category: Audiovisual Equipment" link on there too"
Crag says, "It's just A/V companies in Toronto, so maybe it doesn't get you any closer than your local phonebook"
Ryan says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You're probably still too far out on the edge of the long tail for the net to help you in this particular case"
Ryan says, "the problem is that it's possible to buy a lot of stuff on the net"
Ryan says, "but individual physical retailers haven't done a good job of getting their catalog & info on the net"
Ryan says, "i want to be able to shop before i go into a store"
Crag says, "You'll have to *gasp* use the phone :)"
Crag says, "I hate the phone, so I'm only half joking about the gasp"
Ryan shudders
Crag says, "I hate the competence-level negotiations phones require and the possibility of having to tear a salesperson off one's back"
Crag says, "not fun"
Crag says, "But as far as the net sucking, it's really just your local retailers who suck :)"
Crag says, "I've run into that problem too, though"
Ryan says, "true"
Crag says, "They show up online because of having an old-fashioned interface in the phonebook or something, so yahoo and google will tell me about them, but the stores themselves are still in the dark ages"
Crag says, "And have no reason to join the 90s since most of their customers are more archaic than they are"
Crag says, "It's a start though"
Crag says, "It amuses me how many businesses and people don't realize they can already be found on the internet without having done anything to get there."
Crag says, "Just another example of how some people Don't Get It."
Crag [to Some People]: The isn't free out of idealism, it's free by definition.
Crag s/The/The Internet
Binder don't ged it.
Binder is fresh out of idealism.  Close enough?
Crag [to Binder]: That'll do.
Crag says, "As long as people aren't indignant when technology is indifferent, I'm content."
Binder says, "So you're a technological idealism free zone?"
Binder says, "Or a technological disappointment free zone?"
Binder files himself under Unclear on the Concept.
Binder [to Crag]: you should make it possible to code a post-it note on a brandy snifter.
Crag [to Binder]: That's an excellent suggestion!
Binder . o O ( GENIUS )
Binder [to Crag]: That way, one could combine Next Actions with Drinkink!
Binder [to Crag]: plus or minus (k|g)
Crag grins.
Binder goes to get a snifter and labels it: W/F refill when MT.
Crag says, "I still haven't published GTD.pm yet, but it IS on my Someday/Maybe list"
Crag says, "I will probably publish it after I've made lots of progress on BEM, or maybe when I re-read GTD in March"
Crag [to Binder]: Dan Weatbrook is into GTD
Binder says, "ONE OF US.  ONE OF US."
Crag laughs
Binder says, "The Swedish Chef guy and Crazy Ivan both told me they were into GTD."
Binder says, "But turns out, they were into a derivative more accurately termed 'Make Binder Do That'."
Crag says, "Oooh, yeah, that's a good system too"
Crag says, "MBDT is very effective"
Crag says, "I've been using it for my Make More People Laugh project."
Binder says, "Things like:  <BigCo> is coming to visit tomorrow, my Next Actions are, tell Binder to go get donuts, tell Binder to set up the networking, project, TiVo, tell Binder to rent a projector screen, and to make sure this happens take periodic breaks from playing the PSP and ask him where he is on that."
Binder says, "Where periodic is ~ every 7 minutes."
Crag [to Binder]: That's pretty lame
Crag [to Binder]: Good think you gave them the b00t
Binder says, "My last employer, in retrospect, had a sum of series indistinguishable from infinite assholitude."
Binder [to Crag]: A-MEN ...dable.
Binder says, "New employers, much moah bettah."
Binder says, "Speaking of."
Binder pulls out the tickle folder for today and checks the last email from `rem`.
Crag [to Binder]: You're on emailing terms with Michael Stype?
Crag idly wonders if his spelling was even close on that...
Binder [to Crag]: As soon as unicode takes over the DNS namespace, I'm going to register whatthe?!.com and ....com
Binder [to Crag]: You're phonetically close!
Crag says, "And slashdot will register /..org"
Binder [to Crag]: But no.  Not that REM.  This rem:  http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3529
Crag says, "Somehow I don't see unicode in DNS as a good thing"
Crag says, "Ah!"
Binder [to Crag]: Well, if you consider phishing, exploits and confusion good then more unicode == more better!
Crag says, "Nice tickler!"
Crag says, "is it french?"
Binder [to Crag]: It actually works pretty well for me.  I've got a cron.daily which tells me what's today and what's coming up.
Crag docks Crag an xp for 'good pun'.
Crag says, "I'm using the Zaurus calandar and todo list for those"
Crag says, "But they don't scale well"
Crag says, "So I'm still looking for alternatives."
Crag says, "I already offloaded my someday/maybe to a single text file on wrack"
Binder says, "Data file looks something like this for recurring events, the kind of stuff I tickle:"
Crag says, "Though that doesn't meet the GTD standard requirements"
Binder | REM 30 Jan 2006 *14 MSG Buy blue BART ticket
Binder | REM  4 Feb 2006 *7 MSG Sync phone contacts to Star Address Book
Binder | REM  5 Feb 2006 *7 MSG Dust desk at home
Binder says, "So it's flexible enough to meet all sorts of matching criteria, as that article mentions."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "You can describe conditions like last-weekday-of-the-month, second-monday-unless-it's-a-work-holiday, whatever."
Binder says, "Give it a repeat interval and an early warning period."
Crag says, "The db format is almost DJB-friendly"
Binder says, "Then let cron do the heavy lifting of figuring out what pertains and spit it out at you whenever you need it."
Crag says, "I like that.  I'm sending myself a note about it."
Binder says, "One thing you may observe is that remind doesn't do time-of-day."
Binder says, "It has no scope tighter than the day.  Which for a tickle/reminder works fine."
Binder says, "Because the tickle should be different from the hard landscape day planner."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "The zaurus todo has that aspect as well"
Binder says, "One mild drawback remind has over paper tickler folders is that it's faster to refile a paper version to postpone something."
Crag says, "The zaurus todo items have a 'start day' and will only show up in the calendar on or after that day"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Refiling them is a 'simple matter' of changing that day"
Crag says, "But it's slow to go back and forth between the calendar and todo list apps"
Crag says, "So it's sub-optimal"
Binder says, "One significant plus remind has for me over paper folders is that I can't grep paper."
Crag says, "Paper filing would be unacceptable to me though"
Crag says, "Because I hate paper like you hate pants"
Ryan ponders returning to stripping wallpaper
Ryan says, "or cleaning"
Ryan says, "or trying to debug this fundamentally fux0red code"
Crag mmm, stripper wallpaper...
Binder doesn't think he could resist the allure of exotic wallpaper dancers.
Ryan nods.
Crag wins!
Binder [to Crag]: By taking the low road!
Crag says, "as usual"
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!

Binder [to Crag]: you should make a way to place a brick against three coins.
Crag grins.
Binder . o O ( that'll learn 'em! )
Binder says, "WOOHOO."
Crag says, "I'm not going to do any moo or mud programming until my BEM-based PrimordialMUD is running"
Binder is fabulously well off.
Binder says, "My money market fund has earned THREE DOLLARS!"
Crag [to Binder]: My simplest-thing-that-could work Primordial MUD provides only user and room descriptions and navigation.
Binder can buy a really mediocre latte now.
Crag [to Binder]: YOU'RE CRAZY RICH!!!
Binder ponders that.
Binder [to Crag]: Hum.
Crag says, "yay, stimulants!"
Binder [to Crag]: Well.
Binder [to Crag]: If we're being literal.  The s-t-t-c-w as a MUD seems to me to be:
Binder [to Crag]: 1) accepts / binds socket connects
Binder [to Crag]: 2) accepts text on those sockets
Binder [to Crag]: 3) responds with text
Binder says, "So you could meet sttcw with one room, no verbs."
Crag says, "that would just be IRC"
Binder says, "Essentially it's IRC at that point."
Crag wins again!
Crag says, "One of PrimordialMUD's requirements is that its users don't need a client more sophisticated than telnet (or netcat, for that matter)"
Crag says, "Hence the need for user and room descriptions"
Binder says, "Or at least for objects."
Binder ponders SMTP as a MUD protocol.
Binder slaps himself.
Crag [to Binder]: Specific protocols are just details :)
Crag says, "SMTP could cetainly be made to work, eventually"
Crag says, "or Internet Mail 2000, for that matter"
Binder eyes Crag.
Binder [to Crag]: notify-user-crag-have-pose-for-him notify-user-crag-have-pose-for-him notify-user-crag-have-verb-for-him
Crag heh
Binder polls the MUD for his backlog of social interaction.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "It wouldn't be a GOOD fit..."
Crag says, "I guess that's another area where the concept of an impedence mismatch applies"
Binder says, "So what's the minimum step above IRC, object persistence?"
Crag says, "I think so"
Crag says, "That's why I included rooms as part of PrimordialMUD"
Crag says, "I really just wanted something people could interact with and see the potential"
Binder says, "But IRC has rooms."
Binder says, "They're called channels."
Crag says, "Yes, but it doesn't have navigation"
Crag says, "Or rather it only has teleportation"
Crag says, "MUD rooms differ from channels in their topology"
Crag says, "I left out other objects because this was supposed to be my first iteration"
Binder says, "Or at least in there being a [minor] time investment to move."
Crag says, "Sadly I am playing both the customer and developer roles in this XP implementation"
Binder [to Crag]: I can not tell you how many times I have been there.
Binder [to Crag]: In my experience, it doesn't ... work.  Not well.
Binder says, "Too easy to compromise with one's self."
Crag says, "true"
Crag says, "I don't see any other practical option at this stage"
Crag says, "This isn't a business project, so a lot of what I'm reading about XP is hard to translate"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "And I don't have people available to fill in roles"
Crag says, "It's just me, Raine, Nicole and Nicole's brother Nate."
Crag says, "And Raine and Nate are barely involved at all at this point"
Crag brb
Binder codes the ability to push a post-it note on a welsh corgi.
Binder . o O ( fuck you, corgi, take it TAKE IT! )
Crag back
Crag giggles
Crag [to stormagnet]: Don't look dear!
Crag [to Binder]: I bet I added the corgi to the indirect object list after seeing Coboy Bebop.
Crag says, "Speaking of corgis, Raine is unsurprisingly infatuated with her Nintendogs"
Crag says, "if i were the jealous type I might even feel threatened"
Binder [to Crag]: Didn't you get nintendogs, yourself?
Crag says, "yeah, I got bored with it quickly"
Crag says, "Sit, Ubu, sit!  Good dog."
Crag says, "We ended up buying one copy of nintendogs, animalcrossing wide world and gun from GameFly"
Binder guesses the simulation doesn't include the ability to 'sic'.
Crag says, "yeah, no PVP in that game"
Binder says, "So much for it being a dog eat dog world."
Crag . o O ( and I'm wearing MilkBone underwear )
Binder . o O ( doesn't that chafe? )
Crag . o O ( and how! )
Binder observes two people put the SAME EVENT in mosuki.
Binder says, "It wasn't interesting the first time I read about it."
Crag says, "On my windows box there are processes whose 'mem usage' is greater than their 'vm size'"
Crag says, "I wonder if 'mem usage' includes kernel memory and VM size doesn't"
Binder listens, rapt.
Crag heh
Crag says, "liar"
Binder says, "I don't know what those words mean, but they sound so seXXXy!"
Binder says, "Shouldn't you be sprinkling trademark symbols in there?"
Crag says, "Your sarcasm foo is strong"
Crag says, "probably"
Binder says, "That's because I drink at the sarcasm bar."
Crag says, "I'm a bad user"
Binder says, "A bad limited-scope licensed user [tm]."
Crag [to Binder]: I DOUBT IT
Crag . o O ( I need more Skeptopatamus )
Binder [to Crag]: Or DO you?
Binder starts to ask Crag if Crag read that one thing but can't remember a useful descriptor for describing that one thing.
Crag laughs
Binder [to Crag]: So never mind!  You probably didn't!  And couldn't find it from what little I remember!
Binder [to Crag]: But it was funny AND appropriate.
Crag says, "I'm sure I would have liked it"
Binder [to Crag]: I assure you, you would have!
Crag checks the archives
Crag [to Binder]: SAVE THE TREES!!! FOR DESERT!!!
Crag says, "Er, DESSERT even"
Binder says, "Either works."
Binder wouldn't want to be caught up a sandy gulch without a paddle-tree.
Binder regresses to nineteen and has cold pizza and Diet Coke for breakfast.
Crag sings, "Hey nineteen..."
Crag [to Binder]: Is this what you were thinking of? http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/index457.html
Binder [to Crag]: YES!
Binder [to Crag]: Though I had misremembered the ... punch?  line?
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I had not seen it"
Crag says, "I'm way behind"
Binder [to Crag]: Your ability to infer context borders on the Lisp-like.
Crag says, "Will have to catch up later"
Crag [to Binder]: Why thank you.
Binder [to Crag]: My boss does conversational closures.
Binder [to Crag]: It's not quite stack based but if he catches a nonmaskable interrupt he will late resume the previous conversation with no prelude.
Crag says, "That's... kinda cool..."
Crag says, "I think."
Binder [to Crag]: It was startling the first few times he did it.
Binder says, "Now I'm used to it."
Binder idles to dust his desk off.
Binder says, "Well, that was redundant of me."
Binder idles: dusting my desk, just like I said.  damnit
Crag kicks the Windows in The Other Knee
Crag [to Binder]: Performance Monitor multiples the Virtial Memory usage by the number of threads, even though (as far as I know) the memory is shared (hence the 'thread' thing).
Crag says, "So the process size stat is utterly useless"
Crag says, "No, I'm wrong"
Crag says, "The Virtual Bytes is just the size of the address space, not the amount of space actually used."
Crag says, "That's my mistake"
Crag says, "So it's still useless to me"
Crag says, "But not for the reason I think"
Crag says, "There appears to be no metric for 'process size'"
Crag says, "So all my Mozilla complaining is for naught"
Crag [to stormagnet]: this is rant is more for your sake than anyone elses
Crag s/is //
Binder [to Crag]: But I appreciate you sharing it with us.
Binder finds it diverting.
Binder [to Crag]: Maybe Vista will make more sense.
Crag [to Binder]: now you're just mocking me :)
Binder says, "It seems to me that with every iteration, Windows becomes more Unix like."
Binder says, "So with enough time, it'll eventually be as usable as, say, Minix."
Crag grins.
Binder [to Crag]: Not just mocking you!  Also, BillG, SteveB, and thousands of highly educated and compensated professional software engineers!
Crag says, "oh that's OK then"
Crag says, "Surely VR Studios will hire me and I can put more distance between me and Windows."
Binder . o O ( how can it be that volunteer teenagers with attention deficit disorder out architect paid, experienced professionals? )
Binder says, "What platform do they dev on?"
Binder says, "They run on Linux, no?"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "The client runs on Windows, though"
Crag says, "So I'm probably just dreaming to think I can get away from it"
Crag says, "Still..."
Crag sighs
Binder shrugs.
Binder works in a shop which hosts on Linux, devs on Windows.
Binder says, "I have minimal Windows exposure, only from the inhouse people."
Binder says, "I actually only mind Windows in [a] my production environment & [b] my personal work systems."
Binder says, "The last place I was insisted on it in both places after having told me they were a Linux shop.  SURPRISE!"
Crag says, "[b] is the problem in my case"
Binder says, "vmware not an option?"
Crag says, "Or rather [b] is the source of my frustrations right now"
Crag says, "Maybe"
Crag says, "I could ask"
Binder says, "Or just do it."
Binder says, "Fait accompli."
Binder says, "It's like $200 to license vmware."
Crag says, "yeah, that's a lot of mochas"
Binder says, "It's fewer lapdances."
Binder says, "I guess you have to balance it against how frustrating Windows is for you to use daily."
Binder says, "For me, definitely worth it."
Crag says, "I'll ask the company to pay for it first, and if they won't I will"
Binder says, "I've got Ubuntu 5.10 on this laptop, vmware running occasionally on that, hosting Windows for the things I am asked to do which require Windows."
Crag says, "In my case I'd be running Outlook and Service Desk in VMWare"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "And I'd need the ability to cut-n-paste URLs from servicedesk to the hosting linux"
Crag says, "Oh, i could do that"
Binder says, "Yes."
Crag says, "With RDP to my vmware instance"
Crag says, "that would be pretty clever"
Binder . o O ( it's vnc all the way down )
Binder [to Crag]: Actually.
Binder [to Crag]: Not to, like, uncomplicate things.
Binder [to Crag]: But if you have vmware tools installed, you can copy-paste in and out of the hosted OS without hurdles.
Binder [to Crag]: vmware does The Right Thing.
Binder [to Crag]: But you can still use RDP!
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I didn't know vmware could do that"
Crag . o O ( pretty cool )
Binder says, "vmware has gotten cooler since I last saw it."
Linux has connected.
Windows has connected.

Binder has forgotten so much about building 7th Sea decks.
Binder suspects it's mostly suppression at work.
Crag grins.
Ryan sighs.
Ryan says, "was removing wallpaper in the washroom.  a chunk of plaster came with some.  behind it... all slightly damp, water damage"
Crag says, "I heara ya, brothuh"
Crag says, "We've got some water problems in the house too"
Crag says, "I don't think there's such a thing as a house which ISN'T a fixer-upper"
Crag says, "I think as soon as the contractor hammers the last nail into the house it develops its first problem, if not sooner."
Binder blames Big Design Up Front.
Crag says, "Sounds like a reasonable assessment"
Ryan says, "my house is 80 years old"
Ryan says, "so, well"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "my parents' house is about that old too, I think"
Crag says, "I have some vague idea of the kinds of problems you're up against"
Ryan says, "mostly previous owners neglect"
Crag says, "Our house has some problems caused by previous owners' attempts at improvement"

Crag neverminds
Crag [to stormagnet]: Remember me talking about how I wonder what sort of analysis goes into Football?  I checked ESPN to see what they had about the game today and was pleasantly surprised by the first article I read.
Crag says, "Some people really DO think about the deeper abstractions within the game"
Crag says, "This article is still mostly at the statistical and psychological level, but I'm getting the feeling that deeper analyses are out there somewhere, just waiting for me to find them."
Crag says, "It's still not quite chess, but it's something"
Crag . o O ( Why do I go LOOKING for things to be interested in while simultaneously looking for things to stop being interested in? )
Crag . o O ( And why do i use the think verb so much )
Crag says, "Hrm, a new use of the particle 'geek' I'm not familiar with:"
Crag | In what will almost certainly be the final game of his Pro Football Hall of Fame career, and in front of his hometown fans and virtually every one of his family members, tailback Jerome Bettis is apt to be pretty geeked up.
Binder hides the chicken necks.
Binder wonders wtf he sat down here at this computer.
Binder says, "There was a thing ... which I was looking for."
Binder says, "Oh, right."
Crag . o O (  he's looking for... a stabbing. )
Crag . o O ( no, that too is wrong )
Binder ponders.
Binder says, "No, I was looking for airports near Wisdom, MT."
Binder asked Google.
Crag says, "How do I fly to Montanna on this MUD?"
Binder says, "Who knew?  Wisdom, MT is not a major metropolitan area."
Binder eyes Warren Ellis.
Binder  [to Warren Ellis]:  Stellify a planet?  You made that up!
Crag says, "Stellify is a perfectly cromulant word"
Binder continues reading "Ocean" and laughs and laughs.

Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!
Binder [to Crag]: Liar!
Crag bleeds out
Crag says, "I've always been a weak excuse for a geek"
Crag says, "I like the premise as described on that page"
Crag says, "This is the same Warren Ellis that the Penny Arcade guys clowned?"
Crag . o O ( it must be )
Crag says, "I had wondered in that story why Warren Ellis would be at the same event as the Penny Arcade guys"
Crag says, "For some reason I thought he wrote graphics-less novels like mysteries or thrillers or something"
Crag shrugs
Crag says, "Espn should make an MMORPG-esq football simulation game"
Crag says, "And allow users to take on not just player roles but coach and manager too"
Crag says, "Then they could take their Fantasy Football thing much farther."
Crag says, "it would have to not suck, obviously :P"
Crag says, "And they'd have to work out a deal with EA"
Crag says, "there would almost certainly be some kind of evil involved."
Crag says, "I'm going to mention it to the VR Studios guys on Thursday, though"
stormagnet [to Crag]: That's Harlan Ellison you're thinking of
Crag says, "Oh."
Crag [to stormagnet]: yeah, you're right
Crag says, "Wait, was Harlan Ellison the one PA clowned?"
Crag says, "What WAS he doing at that event?"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Warren Ellis is Transmetropolitan
Crag says, "ah, right"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Being a Sci-Fi Luminary
Crag says, "I see"
Crag says, "Easy names to confuse"
stormagnet [to Crag]: The more interesting question is, what were the PA people doing there
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That IS a good question..."
Crag says, "Clearly they were their to clown H.E."
stormagnet [to Crag]: New media!
Crag says, "I see"

Binder just spent 45 minutes wrasslin' with Outlook.
Binder says, "So we've got Exchange.  Hosted by a company called intermedia."
Binder says, "With a web interface for managing the mailboxes, etc."
Binder says, "But it turns out that if you want to add a Resource, such as a conference, room, not only must you create a mailbox for that Resource, you must set up an Exchange MAPI account in Outlook for that mailbox, connect to it, change three options and edit permissions for everyone in your Global Address Book, before anyone can actually -use- that resource."
Binder requires additional coffee-flavored beverages.
Crag [to stormagnet]: Work's a little slower now (knock on wood), so I can respond to what you were saying before if you want.

Crag [to Binder]: rused by your own damn self
Binder says, "Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me again ... won't get fooled again."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "The parting on the left, is now a parting on the right?"
Binder says, "But the extra good part about that Outlook story is that I had to set up a new profile anytime I wanted to switch identities."
Binder says, "Otherwise, Outlook would start and die, claiming it couldn't access my 'folders'."
Binder says, "Whatever that means."
Binder now has half a dozen Outlook 'profiles' in a Windows instance.  
Binder says, "Whee."
Crag [to Binder]: yep, been there
Binder says, "So what I should do."

Crag [to Binder]: I recommend the Habits books if you haven't already read them.
Binder [to Crag]: They're wishlisted.

Binder [to Crag]: Frankly, probably won't in 2006, unless someone puts them into my hands.
Crag says, "Oh oh... well maybe someone will have to do something about that..."
Binder [to Crag]: I'm doing GREAT on reading 50 novels in 2006.
Binder [to Crag]: But that's my primary reading focus.
Binder [to Crag]: Roy[meo] did put a copy of Asset Allocation into my hands so I'll read that after Slow River.
Binder [to Crag]: It's a guide to thinking about things like 401k and other investment portfolio composition.
Crag says, "That subject's going to be the focus of my Taurus reading in April/May"
Binder says, "I need to talk to my tax person [as I think I mentioned earlier today] before I do anything else with my retirement stuff."
Binder called her and what she said didn't persuade me that she's right and I'm wrong, but it won't hurt to wait.
Binder says, "Since I'll see her before the 4/15 cut off for 2005 contributions to an IRA."
Crag nods
Binder whistles.
Binder says, "So, Threnody was living on 900 calories a day after her tooth work."
Binder says, "Protein shakes."
Binder has 900 calories mid-way through LUNCH.

Binder can't imagine surviving on 1/3 that.

Binder eats chocolate.
stormagnet says, "Ugh"
Binder says, "No, it's really good."
Binder says, "Well."
Binder says, "Not European chocolate good."
Binder says, "It's Hershey stuff.  But it's better than no chocolate."
stormagnet says, "Apparantly, by 'head to the gym' I meant 'get halfway there before my mp3 player's battery runs out"
Binder . o O ( stormagnet is sonic propelled? )
stormagnet [to Binder]: My 'Ugh' was unrelated to your chocolate
stormagnet is, in fact, somically propelled
stormagnet is SONICALLY propelled, even
stormagnet says, "Word to the wise:"
Binder is somatically propelled.
stormagnet says, "Oregon Scientific products?"
stormagnet says, "CRAP."
Binder deliberates paying attention.
Binder . o O ( am i wise?  how would i know? )
stormagnet says, "The battery only charges via USB"
stormagnet says, "GENIUS"
Binder [to stormagnet]: Who what now?
Binder [to stormagnet]: Your mp3 player is from Oregon Scientific?
stormagnet says, "Also, it is impossible to properly randomize the playlist"
stormagnet [to Binder]: Yes
Binder [to stormagnet]: That brand name to me implies:  designed by hippies, built by survivalists.
stormagnet [to Binder]: As is my pedometer, which ALSO is crap
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet [to Binder]: Awesome name, crap company
Binder [to stormagnet]: Clearly Oregon is not pulling their weight as a Left Coast state.
stormagnet nods solemnly
Binder . o O ( oregon, get your shit together! )
stormagnet says, "ALSO, it does not remember state"
stormagnet says, "I have to reset the volume settings each time"
Binder says, "Though given the design flaws, perhaps designed by survivalists, assembled by hippies, is more apt."
Binder . o O ( this mp3 player needs more ... gunrack space ... )
stormagnet says, "And if I leave it on pause, it has a 'power saving' feature that turns it off after 1 minute"
stormagnet says, "So, although it has a capacity of 512 MB"
stormagnet says, "I never get to hear more than maybe an hour of my playlist"
stormagnet says, "Unless I manually skip forward about a bazillion tracks"
stormagnet says, "Also, it does not handle folders"
stormagnet could go on. And on.
Binder [to stormagnet]: You've convinced me!
Binder hates Oregon Scientific on stormagnet's behalf.
stormagnet laughs
Binder has been eyeing a Neuros for a while.

Crag [to stormagnet]: Today was a bad day for me to be late.  I had a one-on-one with Allison secheduled for 7am
stormagnet [to Crag]: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEp
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm so sorry
stormagnet headdesks
Crag [to stormagnet]: We've got to do something about mornings.
Crag says, "I dunno what"
Crag says, "I'm no saint"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "It's mostly me, though"
stormagnet says, "I need to set a timer"
stormagnet says, "And find more ways to get ready faster"
Crag says, "I got to have a 15 minute one-on-one anyway"
stormagnet says, "That's good"
stormagnet is somewhat relieved

---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
At Walt Disney Studios, we released the first installment of the Disney-branded The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in partnership with Walden Media to great commercial success globally.  To date, this film has become one of the largest grossing Disney live action films in history, with worldwide box office of $649 million.  This box office result and our success at retail with Narnia products like our video game reflect the enormous franchise potential of this property, which we expect will continue with the release of our second film in the series, Prince Caspian, slated to hit theaters in December, 2007.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Binder says, "That's what I like to see, something beloved taken and abused and soiled."
Binder scratches his head.
Binder . o O ( i think i'm remembering things which haven't happened, yet, again )
Crag [to Binder]: I'm sorry you had to see that
Binder shrugs.
Binder says, "Vy liked the movie."
Crag says, "But Raine was looking forward to the sequels and I'm trying to lower her expectations so she's not as disappointed as I know she will be."
Crag says, "Oh we loved the movie"
Binder didn't see it.
Crag says, "It's awesome"
Crag says, "You should totally see it"
Crag says, "It's hard to believe Disney was involved"
Binder decides to buy a Mac mini.
Crag [to Binder]: That sounds like a fine idea
Binder nods.
Binder is a fine person, therefore, has fine ideas.
Binder eyes pr0n lag.
Crag says, "It's not me"
Binder says, "As a side benefit, this gets me non-Juarez media for OS X Tiger."
Binder says, "Which I can then use to restore the Powerbook."
Binder says, "Assuming I don't decide to put OpenBSD or Ubuntu or Debian on it."
Binder [to Crag]: This is what I'm doing this coming weekend:
Binder [to Crag]: http://www.codecon.org/2006/schedule.html
Crag . o O ( what is the deal with this lag )
Crag says, "Oh, I know what the lag is"
Crag heh
Crag says, "My co-worjker is copying music from wrack :)"
Crag [to Binder]: So you're diggin on OS X then?
Crag peers at codecon
Crag says, "wow, sounds like fun!"
Binder [to Crag]: Well, Vy digs on it and since I won't subject her to Windows and she's not interested in learning a new OS, that means OS X to replace the Powerbook which just died.
Crag nods.
Binder is intrigued by the Mini form factor.
Binder says, "My boss just bought one and put oBSD on it for his home MX/DNS/FS."
Crag says, "I've always been attracted to the Shuttle, and the Mini appleas to me for similiar reasons"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Pleasantly compact."
Binder says, "Though probably a pain to open and partswap."
Binder says, "The Shuttle I have is cramped and annoying."
Binder says, "But I'm not planning to make many mods to the Mini."
Crag nods.
Binder plans to buy the middle-line model with wifi & bt, up the RAM at purchase, and otherwise ignore it.
stormagnet [to Crag]: That woul also probably explain why my ssh keeps timing out
stormagnet ponders whether or not she's desperate enough to buy the overpriced AAA batteries at the student bookstore
stormagnet says, "Goddamn dude"
stormagnet couldn't even stay connected long enough to restart her screen session, that time
stormagnet says, "On the other hand, I think I survived that test this morning alright"
stormagnet says, "Only got a 92% on my linguistics midterm, though"
stormagnet <- spoiled
stormagnet says, "I would get *killed* if my classmates heard me complaining about my grades, but I can't seem to get satisfaction out of anything less than a 100%"
stormagnet says, "And when I get *that*, unless it's a major exam, my only real response is "Well, about time.""
stormagnet blames her mom
Binder blames stormagnet's mom, too.
Binder mmmms.
Binder says, "This Dell has a nice BIOS."
Binder was able to painlessly change the sequence of the boot drives.
Binder thinks about extending the lv with the new pv added to the vg.

Crag says, "I just read 'Arial' (as in the font) as 'Anal'"
Crag says, "YES, PLEASE format my email in the ANAL font!"
Binder steps back.
Binder [to Crag]: Maybe you need a nap.
Crag says, "Yes.  Have some."
Crag says, "Oh my, it's almost time for me to think about considering making plans to arrange for some sort of trek to aquire what would end up being some sort of lunch, maybe."
Binder . o O ( yes. have s@#$^#^ )
Crag . o O ( or maybe not )
Crag [to Binder]: Did I tell you I started playing Gun again, this time on Hard?
Binder [to Crag]: You had not.
Crag says, "There must be something about Neversoft games that resonates with me"
Crag says, "It's my third time playing the game and I'm still finding it compelling"
Crag says, "Obviously I've been skipping the cut scenes now that I know the "story""
Binder nods.
Crag says, "But the action is engaging"
Binder says, "They've probably got a solid game engine, then."
Crag says, "The interface (On the GC version) is appropriate for the context"
Crag says, "I think so"
Crag says, "I think it's a solid engine and good principles of balance and UI design"
Crag says, "Gun comes off looking kinda weak at first"
Crag says, "It's too short and the side quests are... pathetic"
Crag says, "But I see some of the same strengths from the Tony Hawk games"
Crag says, "The only way I can think of to describe it is as 'playable'"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "An engine which stays out of your way is good."
Crag says, "I really hope they come out with a Gun sequel"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "That's what it is too"
Crag says, "It's a kind of low-overhead engine"
Binder ponders lunch.
Binder is feeling peckish already.
Crag says, "I have no idea what sort of lunch to have"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Sammich
Crag says, "The Pioneer Square area isn't exactly Robert-friendly as far as food goes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Crag]: Pizza?
Crag [to stormagnet]: That's about as far as I've gotten so far
Crag says, "sammich is I mean"
Crag says, "pizza..."
Crag says, "hm"
Crag checks local.google

Crag says, "It would be quick... and greasy, I suppose"
Crag says, "I'm thinking about getting takeout from Collins Pub"
Crag says, "I'm feeling... decadant"

Crag says, "It is decided"
Crag says, "I will call Collins as soon as Jean gets back"
Crag says, "And I will have the hamburger.  And it will be AWESOME."
stormagnet says, "GENIUS!"
Crag says, "Unless this significant ticket I just got turns out to be for real"

Windows sits in the corner

Windows sniffles conspicuously
Crag [to stormagnet]: We can add a 'Corner' $seat if you want.
stormagnet LAUGHS!
stormagnet [to Crag]: Make it so!
Crag [to stormagnet]: JaysHouseMOO had a Corner seat in the living room that people had to sit in on purpose in order to sit in it at all
Crag says, "Alright"
stormagnet wonders what the object number is...
Crag says, "Remind me in a few minutes"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'll take care of it after this ticket"
stormagnet tried to do it herself, but failed T_T
stormagnet [to Crag]: After LUNCH, you mean
stormagnet demands that food take precedence
Crag says, "yay, it cleared"
Crag says, "fine, after lunch"
Crag says, "but don't forget to remind me :)"
Crag uses stormagnet has his trusted filing system.
Crag says, "Crap, ticket storm"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Oh, I bet I know why. Heh."
Crag says, "yep, SQL server reboot.  Luckily Ron warned us this time"
Crag says, "but I still have to deal with the tickets."
Crag says, "So no lunch JUST yet (and Jean is still away from his desk)"
Crag says, "I'm all alone!  Oh NOES!"
Crag [to Binder]: That's one thing that's a lot different since you were here.  One perrson can cover a day shift without crying.
Binder [to Crag]: Whee!
Binder [to Crag]: But they can still cry if they want to, right?
Binder misreads this Dove Promise text.  "Discover how much your head can hold."
Binder continues to stuff chocolate into his head.
Binder says, "The MySQL meetup I went to last night was boring."
Binder says, "Like all the previous ones I've gone to."
Binder says, "I think maybe I won't go to any more."
Binder says, "Until or unless I can give a presentation of my own."
Binder says, "Speaking of."
Binder looks at this project he's been working on with a former manager which uses mysql.
Crag [to Binder]: crying is strictly forbidden.  Cry babies report to Doug for termination.
Binder says, "WOO!"
Binder likes the terminating part.
Crag says, "The terminating means it's working"
stormagnet broke down and got another overpriced-but-nominally-healthy lunch
Binder [to stormagnet]: More cost == more healthy!
Binder [to stormagnet]: Expensive foods are healthier for you.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Like wine.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Caviar.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Exotic cheeses.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Kobe beef.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Carbon fiber.
Binder [to stormagnet]: European cathedrals.
Windows . o O ( mmmm... carbon fiber )
Windows . o O ( good for the semicolon! )
Windows might be HIGH
Binder says, "Situation Normal, All Fucked Up."
stormagnet says, "In. FUCKING. Deed."
stormagnet says, "I'm sooooo tempted to push my luck at the salad bar"
stormagnet says, "Fill a plate with hard boiled eggs, cheese, and olives"
stormagnet says, "Except that for what they're charging, they'd probably STILL turn a profit"
stormagnet grumbles
Binder says, "What profits it a salad bar if it gains the whole income and loses the salad dressing?"
Crag heads down to pick up his HAMBURGER
Binder dispatches a hamburglar to deal with that.
stormagnet [to Binder]: THEY CHARGE FOR THAT, TOO
stormagnet has the HATEY
Crag says, "the burger was disappointing."
Crag sighs
Binder weeps beefy tears.
Binder [to Crag]: Cheer up, buckaroo, you'll get a good burger next time.
Binder [to Crag]: And now for something completely different.
Binder [to Crag]: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=556
Crag . o O ( an editor with three buttpads... )
Crag blinks at this Perl IDE thingie...
Crag [to Perl IDE vim plugin]: Where have yuo been all my life?
Binder pokes stormagnet.
Crag s/yuo/you
Binder [to stormagnet]: Psst.  You missed your cue.
Binder [in the voice of stormagnet]:  buttpud!
Crag laughs!
Binder . o O ( crap, i screwed up the line! )
Crag says, "Lately it's more like 'BUTTpaaaad'"
Binder says, "The evolution of memes."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I gotta try this perl IDE thing out"
Binder nods.
Crag [to Binder]: You're more of an emacs guy, right?  I forget
Binder [to Crag]: Heavens, no.
Crag says, "Oh, sorry"
Crag heh
Crag says, "I think of you as having that sort of snooty idealism :)"
Binder [to Crag]: My position vis-a-vis vi v. emacs is similar to my position vis-a-vis republicans v. democratic party
Crag laughs
Crag says, "kill them all and whatever?"
Binder [to Crag]: Close enough.
Binder votes a straight Whatever ticket.
Crag says, "Hooker for president!"
Binder @@
Crag says, "Hooker/Whatever '08!"
Binder would hit it.
Crag says, "I know you would"
Crag . o O ( too bad debian doesn't package vim modules )
Binder says, "Yeah."
Crag [to stormagnet]: Is tomorrow OK for Martha to come over again?
Crag says, "I can tell her no"
Binder [to Crag]: I had an idea for perl-pkg which would be like the newish java-pkg and the familiar kernel-package.
Crag [to Binder]: You know I love packaging
Crag says, "But then I also love solving a problem once"
Crag says, "and then applying that solution all over the palce"
Crag says, "plave"
Crag says, "place"
Crag says, "I'm a guy with an abstract hammer looking for abstract nails."
Binder . o O ( here at thought experiment laboratories... )
stormagnet [to Crag]: Tomorrow is okay, but NOT Thursday
Crag [to stormagnet]: Ok, I'll give her a call back later tonight
stormagnet [to Crag]: As I have way too much homework due Friday
stormagnet nods
stormagnet [to Binder]: Ergo my cue-missing
Crag says, "She said she can use the couch if you need to use your study area"
stormagnet says, belatedly, "But... PAD!"
stormagnet [to Crag]: Naw, it's more of a need-to-be-anti-social thing
stormagnet [to Crag]: I think I'll hole up in the computer room with all my books
stormagnet [to Crag]: I'm too polite/wishy-washy to properly assert my need to study WITHOUT conversation, otherwise
Crag says, "that's true."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "And it doesn't help that I would really RATHER be conversing with Martha, who, after all, I don't see very often"
Crag grins.
stormagnet reidles to do more homework
Binder [to Crag]: You still keep a squirt bottle for the cats?
Binder [to Crag]: You could use it to help motivate stormie to study.
Binder is Mr. Bad Idea.
Binder . o O ( nagios o nagios have you met nagios, nagios the tattooed lady )
Crag [to Binder]: I bet she'd like that...
Binder [to Crag]: Just don't use holy water.
Crag . o O ( holy water, the swiss cheese of liquids )
Binder is made wholly of water.
Crag [to stormagnet]: I need references on that field (in)dependent thing to send to DanW (and to look over for my own sake as well)
Crag says, "Tried googling and got crap"
Crag says, "MAN!  I am feeling extra bitchy today"
Crag says, "I need some male midol"
Binder [to Crag]: Have you tried stabbing?
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Crag laughs
[with the ice pick]
Crag stabs Binder with an ice pick.  Neat!
Binder dies from a wound inflicted by Crag with the ice pick.
Binder has left.
You page Binder, "That was somehow disappointing."
You page Binder, "Now I just want to work on the StabbingSystem to make it more fun"
Binder arrives from the heavens.
Crag grins.
Binder [to Crag]: Oh, right, you need me to give you distractions!
Crag says, "I do feel a little better"
Crag says, "I've decided to ask Allison for a raise to keep me from switching to VR Studios"
Crag says, "I just need to settle on a number"
Binder picks four.
Binder says, "That is, 10 ^ 4."
Crag grins.
Crag says, "That sounds about right, actually"
=> 14
[used 2 ticks, 0 seconds.]
Crag says, "It'd be about 14% more"
=> 1428
[used 2 ticks, 0 seconds.]
Crag . o O ( 14.28.. )
Crag says, "And it would Almost bring me in line with the minimum for Unix admins in this area"
=> 20
[used 2 ticks, 0 seconds.]
Binder . o O ( almost )
Crag says, "The root cause of the conflict is the basic incompatibility between my unix-inspired philosophy about technology and DIG BEING RETARDED..."
Crag says, "So the Right Thing would be too look for work elsewhere"
Crag says, "But now it's been almost 4 years... and it's stable and everyone likes me and and and"
Crag says, "I dunno why I'm yammering about this anyway"
Crag says, "nevermind"
Binder [to Crag]: Because you're trying to convince yourself?
Binder dunno.
Binder has a habit of staying too long in jobs he hates.
Binder shrugs.
Binder says, "But eventually I move on and I'm always glad when I do."
Binder LOVES his new job.
Crag says, "I don't hate DIG like you did"
Crag says, "I hate it a different way :)"
Crag says, "it's a disfunctional relationship"
Crag says, "They're with me because I'm good in bed, I'm with them because I'm lazy and they're rich and I know eventually they'll treat me right... er..."
Crag says, "no, that too is wrong"
Crag says, "The other factor in this whole drama is Raine's school situation"
Crag says, "She needs my career to be stable right now"
Crag says, "She'd tolerate change, but now is not the best time"
Crag says, "So I think asking Allison for a raise is my winning move right now"
Crag says, "If she says no and VR Studios still doesn't hire me, I haven't lost anything"
Binder says, "True."
Crag says, "If Allison says yes, I get a raise and I don't have to change anything"
Crag says, "If she says no and VRS hires me I win"
Crag says, "IF they both say yes... jesus I dunno"
Binder says, "And you could still take the raise and still go to VRS."
Crag says, "whatever I pick I win"
Binder says, "At a higher pay rate."
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure I'd get a raise going to VRS anyway"
Crag says, "But then again I'm probably wrong about that"
Crag says, "I was planning on asking for it"
Crag says, "Because the job they described to me was quasi-managerial and sounded like a $90k+ job"
Binder says, "Aaaaaallison.  You know this job is killing me..."
Crag says, "And I'm around 70 now"
Crag says, "so"
Crag laughs
Crag . o O ( Allison and Costello )
Crag . o O ( Allison and Chris Launio )
Binder wouldn't manage for less than $125k.
Binder says, "But that's me.  Too much aggravation to manage."
Crag says, "It's not actual management"
Crag says, "I agree tha 125 is the base for real management"
Crag says, "I would have no reports"
Crag says, "It's a kind of liason position"
Crag says, "A gobetween for Ops and Engineering"
Crag says, "and production"
Crag says, "sortof"
Crag says, "I don't think I'd have much high-profile direct responsibility"
Crag says, "I'd just be a resource for a lot of other people"
Crag says, "Sort of sideways managing"
Crag . o O ( side-talkin' manager )
Binder says, "Assistand Director in High School Theater."
Binder s/sand/sant/
Crag laughs
Crag says, "HS theater, what a zoo"
Crag says, "I haven't done theater, but I suspect that analogy is dead-on"
Crag says, "Debian Weekly News is short today"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Yeah, it almost held my interest long enough to finish reading it."
Crag laughs
Binder does an impersonation of himself reading DWN.  "Oh, hey, Kolab.  Hum, Debian Project Leader Ele...ele ... zzzzz<DELTETED!>"
Crag grnis.
Crag grins, as well.
Crag says, "So you missed the part about the graphical... something"

Crag sits on an easy chair.
Crag drools on the chair
Binder sits on an easy chair.
Crag says, "Oh hey, I can create the corner now"
easy chairs (#280)   generic piece of furniture (#81)   generic sittable object (#80)   generic thing (#5)   root class (#1)
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder kept trying to sit on the rocking chair, forgetting where he was.
You now have corner of the room with object number #998 and parent generic piece of furniture (#81).
The created object is now your current object.
Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: you can just 'sit' without being specific if you want
Crag says, "But then, these other chairs don't rock."
Crag says, "So there's that"

@LOCK
=====

Syntax:  @lock <object> with <key expression>

Set a lock on <object> to restrict its use.  See `help locking'[1] for general information about locking and `help keys'[2] for the syntax and semantics of key expressions.

N.B.  In the case of rooms, you are actually better off setting room.free_entry to 0 thus preventing teleportation and then @locking the various entrances.  The problem with @locking the room itself is that this can make it impossible to drop objects in the room.

KEYS
====

JHCore supports a simple but powerful notation for specifying locks on objects and encryption on notes, among other applications.  The idea is to describe a constraint that must be satisfied concerning what some object must be or contain in order to use some other object.

The constraint is given in the form of a logical expression, made up of object numbers connected with the operators 'and', 'or', and 'not' (written '&&', '||', and '!', for compatibility with the MOO programming language).  When writing such expressions, though, one usually does not use object numbers directly, but rather gives their names, as with most MOO commands.

These logical expressions (called 'key expressions') are always evaluated in the context of some particular 'candidate' object, to see if that object meets the constraint.  To do so, we consider the candidate object, along with every object it contains (and the ones those objects contain, and so on, and not counting administration groups), and every administration group (see `help @admin'[1]) it is a member of, to be 'true' and all other objects to be 'false'.

As an example, suppose the player Munchkin wanted to lock the exit leading to his home so that only he and the holder of his magic wand could use it.  Further, suppose that Munchkin was object #999 and the wand was #1001.  Munchkin would use the '@lock' command to lock the exit with the following key expression:
        me || magic wand
and the system would understand this to mean
        #999 || #1001
That is, players could only use the exit if they were (or were carrying) either #999 or #1001.

To encrypt a note so that it could only be read by Munchkin or someone carrying his book, his bell, and his candle, Munchkin would use the 'encrypt' command with the key expression
        me || (bell && book && candle)

Finally, to keep players from taking a large gold coffin through a particularly narrow exit, Munchkin would use this key expression:
        ! coffin
That is, the expression would be false for any object that was or was carrying the coffin.

There is one other kind of clause that can appear in a key expression:
        ? <object>
This is evaluated by testing whether the given object is unlocked for the candidate object; if so, this clause is true, and otherwise, it is false.  This allows you to have several locks all sharing some single other one; when the other one is changed, all of the locks change their behavior simultaneously.

[Note to programmers: The internal representation of key expressions, as stored in .key on every object, for example, is very simple and easy to construct on the fly.  For details, see `help key-representation'[2].]

INTEGRATION
===========

Some rooms have descriptions which incorporate text from each of the objects in them.  For example, in Jay's kitchen, the thermostat is an object which contributes the sentence "A thermostat is attached to the wall near the appliances."  A description of this type is said to `integrate' objects into itself.

Each object may have separate messages for integrating into room descriptions, player descriptions, and container descriptions, as well as a default message used for integration into anything.  These messages are @integrate_room, @integrate_player, @integrate_container, and @integrate.  Room integration is the best developed of these, and the subject of this documentation.

These instructions are centered around a particular model of integration:  Namely, that you as a builder have created a room, with certain objects that belong in it (at least part of the time), and you want them to be part of the description, instead of showing up in the contents list at its end.  It's also possible for random wandering objects to integrate into the description, but it's hard to make that effective.

EACH OBJECT'S PART
------------------

If the room wants to integrate a given object, the object has control over how it gets integrated, or whether it gets integrated at all.  There are three basic options.

First, an object can be invisible--that is, not to show up in the description at all.  To do this, it must either have a verb :visible or a property .visible that returns or contains a false value.

Second, an object can be visible but not integrate--it'll show up in the contents list, but not in the main text of the description.  If a visible object's @integrate_room message is empty, this happens.

Third, an object can contribute to the description's main text.  Having a non-empty @integrate_room message accomplishes this.  These messages are run through pronoun substitution (see `help pronouns'[1]), so you can include the object's name or its location's name in the text.

It's actually possible for objects to have different integration messages for different locations, but that's not discussed here.

PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER
---------------------------

The text description that people see in a room is effectively made up of its .description and .integrate_paragraphs properties.  The first is a piece of text; the second may be a combination of objects to be integrated and `filler' text to put between them.

The .description property is either a string or a list of strings; it's set with @describe.  This part is simple.  (See `help describe'[2].)  If it's a list, each string is a paragraph; otherwise, the string constitutes the first and only paragraph.

The .integrate_paragraphs property is a little more complicated, and has no associated setter command.  It's a list of lists, representing paragraphs.  The first list is not actually its own paragraph but is appended to the last paragraph of .description; if it's empty, the text paragraph will stand alone.

Each paragraph list is composed of a number of objects and strings.  When somebody looks at a room, the objects' integration messages are all checked; these and the strings are put together in the order given.

[There should be a medium-length example here, and probably furniture should be mentioned.  (Furniture has an automatic integration message.)  And, really, we just need a decent user interface so we can cover up the ugly distinction between .description and .integrate_paragraphs, and probably do something more sensible with visibility too.]

One corner of the room is much darker and ... lonelier than the others.  You are moping in it along with Windows and Linux.

TWO-LETTER
==========

This help text describes the format of pronoun-substitution messages.  Other help texts on pronoun_substitution include:

pronouns[1]
      An overview.
pronoun-substitution[2]
      How to call pronoun_sub and how it works.
pronoun-example[3]
      A detailed example.
two-letter-qr[4]
      A quick reference guide to the format string.
pronoun-style[5]
      Dunno yet.

Pronoun-substitution messages are entered as strings, but are usually converted to an arcane list format before they're used.  This document is about the format of the string entry; the list format may be discussed elsewhere.

The information passed to :pronoun_sub() can have subsitution specifiers in it that are replaced by values that depend on the context.  The string that results after all the substitutions are made is returned.

In the format string that :pronoun_sub() parses, a `%' indicates that a substition should take place.  The characters after it specify the type of substition.  Take a look at this string:

  "%Td %t:(looks) at %dd oddly."

It has three substitutions to be made in it:  `%Td', `%t:(looks)', and `%dd'.

In most cases, a substition consists of three elements:

  o  The % sign, indicating that a substitution should be made.
  o  A symbol indicating the object that should be considered.
  o  A symbol indicating what about that object to substitute.


The Object Specifier
====================

The object specifier is the letter that follows the % sign.  Consider the string:

    "%Td %t:(looks) at %dd oddly."
 

In `%Td' and in `%t:', the object specifer is `t'.  In `%dd', the object specifer is `d'.

The possible letters and the objects that they correspond to include:

  t - represents the thing where the verb calling :pronoun_sub() is stored
  n - represents the player that started the command
  d - represents the direct object of the initial command
  i - represents the indirect object of the initial command
  l - represents the location of the player

As an example, If Munchkin typed this command:

  put duck in pond
 

and the duck had this as a @put_in_water message:

  "%Nd %n:(puts) %td in %id."
 

Then:

  %Nd would get the `d' information on Munchkin and capitalize it.

  %n:(puts) would conjugate `puts' according to Munchkin's gender.

  %td would get the `d' information from the duck.

  %id would get the `d' information from the pond.


The Information Specifier
=========================

The character following the object specifier is the information specifier.  It specifies what sort of information to get about the object.  It can be any of these characters:

  n - the object's name        ("Susan",   "duck",    "king and queen")
  d - definite-article         ("Susan",   "the duck","the king and queen")
  i - indefinite-article       ("Susan",   "a duck",  "a king and queen")
  o - the objective pronoun    ("her",     "him",     "them")
  p - possessive adjective     ("her",     "his",     "their")
  q - possessive pronoun       ("hers",    "his",     "theirs")
  r - reflexive pronoun        ("herself", "himself", "themselves")
  s - subjective pronoun       ("she",     "he,       "they")

Sometimes, several characters follow the object specifier:

  'i  - indefinite possessive  ("a duck's")
  'd  - definite possessive    ("the duck's")
  'n  - possessive name        ("duck's")

In using any of these, you can capitalize the object specifier to have the phrase capitalize--for example, `%Nd' might become "The duck".  If you capitalize both the object specifier and the information specifier (`%ND'), you'll get all caps--"THE DUCK".

Information Specifiers for Verb Conjugation
===========================================

You often want to insert a verb into a sentence, but the conjugation depends on the context that it's used in.  Give this as the information specifer in order to have pronoun_sub conjugate a verb:

  :(foos) - conjugate the verb `to foo'

For example:
  "%ns %n:(runs)"

will result in "he runs", "she runs", or "they run", depending on the gender of the player who called the verb.

If you capitalize the verb, the result will be capitalized:

  "%ns %n:(Runs)"
  => "he Runs"


Information Specifiers for Pluralizing Nouns
============================================

If you want to make a noun singular or plural depending on context, you can give the noun as an information specifier, and it will be pluralized if the object you specified is plural.  This is the format of the information specification:

  '(noun)
 

For example, this string:
  "%nD %n:(shakes) %d'd %d'(hand)."

may result in either:
  "Munchkin shakes Susan's hand."
or
  "Munchkin shakes the king and queen's hands."

Again, capitalizing the noun will result in a capitalized substitution.


Information Specifiers for Object Data
======================================

You can also obtain information about the actual object by using these information specifiers.

  #      - the object's number 
  .(foo) - the object's "foo" property

For example:
  %t.(mood)
would return the string in the object's `mood' property.

If the proprety doesn't exist, the string `Property not found' will be returned.

If you capitalize the property name, the resulting string will be capitalized.


Information Specifiers for Odd Cases
====================================

A list of arguments enclosed in curly brackets (see `help pronoun-literals'[6]) can be used as an information specifier, e.g.:

  %n{u}
 

which produces the same result as `%NN'.  The arguments will be passed directly to :name() during substitution.  Some forms of name, such as the 'in' name, can only be obtained in this manner.  See `help #1:name'[7] for more information.


Random Choice
=============

To add a little variety to oft-used messages, you can specify that one of several messages be chosen at random each time a message is used.  For example:

  %Nd %(%n:(dives) gracefully|%n:(bellyflops) clumsily) into the water.
 

The section in parentheses will be broken up into phrases at the vertical bars (|) and only one of these phrases, chosen at random, will be displayed.  This also works whenever an information specifier contains something enclosed in parentheses:

  %Nd %n:(dives|plunges) gracefully into the water.
 

When used with $you:say_action (see `help $you:say_action') the same alternatives will be used for everyone.  Vertical bars may be included literally by preceding them with a percent sign.
 
Object Locations and Contents
=============================

Sometimes you want information about an object's location.  This can be retrieved by appending an `l' to the object specifier.  For example:

  %tln - Get the `thing' this code is on, find out where it's located, and then get the name of that location. 

This can be done to every kind of object specifier: %tl, %nl, %il, %dl, and %ll.

Moreover, `L' and `c' may be used in the same fashion, to refer to the object's outermost location (usually a room) and its visible contents, respectively.

Object Callbacks
================

The letter `x' can be used in two ways to call back to an object for specialized information.

Firstly, it can be used as an object specifier, followed by another object specifier and some data in curly brackets, thusly:

  %xn{foo arg1 arg2 ...}d

The data in curly brackets is changed into a list, in the way specified in the next section.  Then, during substitution, the substitution mechanism will call the verb `:obj_foo(arg1, arg2, ...)' on the object(s) specified by `%n' to obtain some objects to get the `d' information of.

Secondly, it can be used as an information specifier, like this:

  %nx{foo arg1 arg2 ...}

This case is similar to the above, only the verb called is `:sub_foo' and the mechanism expects text rather than objects.  The returned text is inserted literally for single objects, and turned into an English-style list otherwise.

Other Substitutions
===================

In addition to the format of %(object specifier)(information specifier), you can also use these substitutions:

  %% - A percent sign.   That is:  %
 
  %$a - the argstr to the verb that called :pronoun_sub().
  %$d - the dobjstr to the verb that called :pronoun_sub().
  %$i - the iobjstr to the verb that called :pronoun_sub().
  %$p - the prepstr to the verb that called :pronoun_sub().
 
  %{information} 
 

%{information} allows one to insert an arbitrary list into the data structure used for pronoun substitution.  The format in which the list is specified is discussed in `help pronoun-literals'[8]; how it is interpreted is beyond the scope of this document.

Errata
======

If the information following the % isn't a valid substitution string, the % will remain a %.  This is a clue that the format string needs some work.

Binder | (13:30:22) stp@work: Oh, that's MUCH less nerdy ... no, wait.  Not less.  MORE.  MORE NERDY.
Devil says, "he"
Binder <- mean
Devil says, "oh, if you are wanting to get rid of the powerbook, he might be in the market. nadya's was stolen"
Binder says, "I don't think I do."
Binder says, "I mean, it's tempting and all, to get rid of a computer."
Devil says, "right on"
Binder says, "But I think Vy still needs a mobile writing platform."
Binder says, "And someday maybe I can daydream about using my own Powerbook."
Devil stabs Binder with a boney elbow.  Neat!
Binder says, "So I think my plan now is to pick up a 9.5mm HD and a torx driver and #0 screwdriver."
Binder says, "And crack the case."
Binder says, "And swap drives."
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder says, "And then either install 10.4 or oBSD or both."
Binder says, "Ubuntu is also an option."
Binder says, "Since they all support PPC."
Binder ducks and stumbles, falling over.
Binder says, "Not swap.  Replace the drive."
Binder [to Crag]: CRAG.
Binder [to Crag]: What is your del.icio.us username, Crag?
Binder [to Crag]: Robotcrag?
Devil [to Crag]: buttpad
Devil [to Binder]: buttpad. that should be his del.icio.us

Binder [to Crag]: Also I listened to your song and it is okay.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Bad news, buttpad.com is squatted.
Binder says, "But the .org and .net variants aren't."
Devil [to Binder]: i dunno.  What's japanese for buttpad?
Binder . o O ( buttpado )
Crag [to Binder]: I'm crag on del.icio.us
Crag . o O ( buttpad... is ... squatted? ... heh )
Devil . o O ( oom )
Binder [to Crag]: You like that one?
Binder [to Crag]: OK.  I subscribe to rss feeds for deliciousmarks.
Binder [to Crag]: So I can stalk your bookmarks!
Binder [to Crag]: And to remind me what for: tag to use to send marks to you.
Crag heh
Crag says, "I may migrate my existing bookmarks to delicious tomorrow for my GTD morning fun"
Binder says, "Whee!"
Binder has a NA for @OnWeb to refine his deliciousmarks.
Binder is not using them to maximal efficiency or joy.
Binder would like to have some [tagged with blogroll or some such] show up on his site.
Binder would like to review to make sure nothing marked has gone 404 on him.
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "that would be nice"
Binder would like to refine his folksonomy to cover the things he's thought of since starting.
Devil . o O ( cheese )
Devil . o O ( chocolate )
Devil . o O ( WEEN )
Devil . o O (  Van Helsing = the world greatest MarySue )
Crag [to Devil]: You're looking thoughtful
Devil [to Crag]: That's what she said!
Binder says, "Um."
Binder says, "What?"
Crag [to Devil]: I DOUBT IT
Crag checks the weather report for PRECIOUS TOMATOS.
Devil peers at crag
Devil peers at %crag
Crag [to Devil]: This is not a mush
Crag says, "or whatever"
Binder . o O ( it wequires total concentwashun )
Devil says, "damn"
Crag laughs
Binder says, "It's a mushpit."
Crag says, "I don't know if Waterpoint COre has a generic pronoun-subbing pose"
The verb :pose is nowhere to be found.
Devil mushes about
Binder snubs pronouns.
Crag . o O ( How do I look at people funny on this MUD? )

The Heavens
Well, this is the afterlife.  It's not very interesting.  If only you could live again.  A Happy Angel Food Cake Factory is here.
GhostOfTheManor is here, asleep.
The Entrance Hall
You are in the Entrance Hall of Programmer's Manor, a long and echoing room filled with potted plants.  Some easy chairs are here.    stormagnet and Windows are moping in a particularly dreary corner of the room.
Binder is here.  Devil is distracted.  stormagnet is dozing.  Linux and Windows are off in another world.
Crag has arrived.
Binder [to Crag]: Oh, there you are.
Binder [to Crag]: Numbering
Binder [to Crag]: 
Binder [to Crag]: Version of TeX:
Binder [to Crag]: 
Binder [to Crag]: The current version of TeX is 3.141. Every year in February DEK
Binder [to Crag]: takes a period of two years to go over his E-mail on TeX
Binder [to Crag]: (preprocessed by his secretary) and carries out changes if there
Binder [to Crag]: are any. If a new version will need to be created in February it
Binder [to Crag]: will get the version number 3.1415. Here is a quote what DEK said
Binder [to Crag]: about the TeX versions
Binder [to Crag]: "You might see a pattern in these version numbers. The day I die
Binder [to Crag]: I want someone to go into TeX and change the version to $\pi$, and
Binder [to Crag]: then it shall not change any more."
Binder [to Crag]: 
Binder [to Crag]: Newsgroups: comp.text.tex
Binder [to Crag]: Subject: Lecture of Donal E. Knuth
Binder [to Crag]: From: dov@menora.weizmann.ac.il (Dov Grobgeld)
Binder [to Crag]: Date: Mon, 7 Dec 1992 16:18:57 GMT
Binder [to Crag]: 
Binder [to Crag]: 
Crag [to Devil]: I hope you got a muscle spasm in your stabbing arm
Binder [to Crag]: Where DEK is Knuth, of course.
Binder [to Crag]: So that's another approach to avoiding version number inflation.
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "That's the Pugs approach as well"
Crag says, "They are using 2*pi"
Binder looks at http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/pugs_test_status/haddock/Pugs.Version.html
Binder . o O ( what the? )
Crag says, "I'm zapping Prattle> again.  Too much noise I don't understand."
Crag [to Binder]: Maybe it's a Haskel thing
Binder [to Crag]: It's ... poetry.
Binder [to Crag]: Therefore, I hate it.
Crag says, "I like functional programming, but I think Haskel is just not right"
Binder [to Crag]: Haskell == dysfunctional programming
Crag says, "I agree"
Crag says, "And yet, I can't argue with the success of Pugs"
Binder . o O ( i like functional programming, too, but i take it out of my mouth once in a while )
Crag heh
Binder [to Crag]: Besides, pugs are so cute!  Wif their widdle tails!
Binder [to Crag]: And their nosey nose noses!
Binder [to himself]: ?!
Binder [to Crag]: Never mind that last bit.
Crag [to Binder]: Is stormagnet using force_input() on you?
Binder [to Crag]: The coffee is wearing off.  On.  Something.
Binder [to Crag]: DAMN THAT'S HOT.
Crag LAUGHS
Crag . o O ( DAMN THATS NERDY> )
Binder hums.
Binder | ED: One of your other interests is Haskell, which you say is "faster than C++, more concise than Perl, more regular than Python, more flexible than Ruby, more typeful than C#, more robust than Java, and has absolutely nothing in common with PHP." Given this build-up, could you explain Haskell in one or two sentences?
Binder |
Binder | AT: Haskell is a pure functional language optimised for conciseness and clarity. It handles infinite data structures natively, and offers rich types and function abstractions that give Haskell programs a strong declarative flavor--the entire Pugs compiler and runtime is under 3000 lines of code.
Binder . o O ( INFINITE DATA STRUCTURES NATIVELY. )
Binder . o O ( WHOA BABY )
Crag grins
Binder hums.
Binder says, "OK, I'm sold."
Binder says, "But, first, Python, for work, and Ruby, for myself."
Crag says, "I think infinite data structures is a reference to things like boundless lists which exist in a kind of on-demand fashion."
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "Lazy lists."
Binder says, "Which perl5 has via modules and will have natively in 6."
Binder shifts gears.
Binder quotes from the blog of his nephew's wife.
Binder | There is a constant and excruciating tension for science types in D.C.
Binder |
Binder | It manifests in lots of conversations that go something like this:
Binder |
Binder | DC Politico-Type: "The legislation says X must happen. How can you help us achieve this by date D?"
Binder |
Binder | DC Science-Type: ..oO'The Science says X cannot happen.'Oo.. "Hmm; Have you considered looking at the problem from this angle?"
Binder |
Binder | DC Politico-Type: ..oO'You nerds are so naive about how the real world works'Oo.. "Unfortunately, our time table doesn't permit that kind of effort."
Binder |
Binder | DC Science-Type: ..oO'The science tells you what the real world is like; I can't help that you don't want to deal with reality'Oo.. "Hmm; These are some pretty tough problems you have here."
Binder says, "I like how she incorporates thought balloons into the conversation text."
Crag nodsnods
Binder should probably meet her someday.
Binder says, "I haven't seen that nephew since my father's funeral."
Binder says, "So over four years, now."
Binder finds something to not like about OpenBSD.
Binder says, "Their release upgrade version has no provision for removing specific files."
Binder says, "So in the 3.6 release of OpenBSD, some files stopped being used from /usr/include/g++"
Binder says, "But if those files are still there, they break compilations."
Binder . o O ( whyyyyyy? i dunnnnnno )
Binder says, "So the recommended approach to resolve the situation."
Binder says, "Is to grab a tarball of the current /usr/include tree."
Binder says, "Blow away /usr/include/g++"
Binder says, "Unfurl the tarball in place."
Binder says, "Sub.  Optimal."
Binder . o O ( bow wow wow yippee yo yippee yay )
stormagnet says, "Ugh"
stormagnet says, "Crashing already"
stormagnet says, "And it's the Crazy Prof lecturing today"
stormagnet . o O ( college is a gateway drug )
Devil [to stormagnet]: domokun
stormagnet [to Devil]: Heh. That perked me up a bit.
Devil says, "collego was a great gateway to drugs for me."
stormagnet [to Devil]: I'm thinking I should go try to convince the school nurse that I have narcolepsy
stormagnet . o O ( not that that would be difficult right now )
stormagnet [to School Nurse]: I just can't seem to stay awa-
stormagnet ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
stormagnet keels over
stormagnet just got asked what synchronized sound is
stormagnet says, "It's SOUND"
stormagnet says, "And, get this..."
stormagnet says, "It's SYNCHRONIZED"
Binder . o O ( AMAZING )
Binder moves his lips ... and sound emerges.
stormagnet attempts a pop-culture reference
stormagnet says, "Perchance <insert blond-bimbo-pop-act-of-thenanosecond-here> should have taken this class before going on SNL?"
stormagnet says, "Goddamn it"
stormagnet says, "He forgot to post the lecture notes AGAIN"
stormagnet gives Crazy Prof a NtM
stormagnet tries to think of what homework she can start doing that won't make it obvious that sje's doing homework instead of taking notes
stormagnet . o O ( dammit )
stormagnet . o O ( if I'd known, I would have saved that paper to write during this period, instead of blowing my lunch break on it )
Binder [to stormagnet]: You could make things.
Binder [to stormagnet]: Origami.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Wheeee
stormagnet [to Crag]: Now we're talking about Yojimbo
stormagnet called it
stormagnet totally called it
stormagnet [to Crag]: What time do you get off work today?
stormagnet [to Crag]: And what time is Martha coming over?
stormagnet says, "Heh"
Binder . o O ( heh? )
stormagnet says, "The Wikipedia Prof can't help grinning when Toshiro Mifune is onscreen, either"
stormagnet gives Toshiro Mifune an xp for "Magnificent Bastard"
Binder says, "Holy cats."
Binder realizes it's nearly 1700.
Binder says, "This jdk build has taken all day."
Binder shifts gears AGAIN.
Binder is quite pleased with himself.
Binder says, "Vy seems to really like the new computer."
Binder . o O ( aside from her desire to grill it on the Foreman Grill. )
Binder thinks she's joking.
Binder hopes she's joking.
Binder suddenly races home to stop the insanity.
Binder . o O ( ono_feed nemesis is "%N %<tries> to have %t accuse %d." )
Binder . o O ( mav! )
Crag [to stormagnet]: I'll be done in about 30 minutes (5:30)
Binder drops a Nemesis.
Binder feeds Sandwich to Nemesis.
 points accusingly at 
Binder . o O ( that's no good. )
Crag heh
A dangerous seeming monkey with a well honed pointing finger.
Crag [to the Nemesis]: hi
Binder says, "D'OH."
Binder remembers this.
Binder says, "Stupid quoting rules."
Crag laughs
Binder . o O ( do i really want to do this all over again for the sake of a stupid gag? )
Crag [to Binder]: my sources say yes
Binder [to Crag]: Your 8-ball is gerborken.
Binder sighs.
Crag [to Binder]: ask again later
stormagnet [to Binder]: AWES!
Binder [to stormagnet]: No!  Lame!
Binder must remake.
stormagnet [to Crag]: Any ETA for Tropical Depression Martha?
Crag laughs!
Crag [to stormagnet]: No idea
Crag says, "I'd guess 7"
stormagnet nods
Crag . o O ( topical digression martha )
Crag [to Binder]: the official 8ball answers are on wikipedia.  I may have to make a MOO toy...
Crag hee hee
Crag says, "but not right now"
stormagnet [to Crag]: `crag Ask again later?
stormagnet says, "D'OH"

Crag heh
Crag [to stormagnet]: Assuming I'm picking you up around 5:45, where should I pick you up?
stormagnet changes her name to mav.
mav [to Crag]: The HUB would be best
Crag nods solemnly
Binder . o O ( rattinfrattin )
Binder has forgotten so much about MOO building.
Binder sighs.
Crag idles: trying to get work done before 5:30 and go home
[Idling at 5:13 P.M. on Wed, Feb 8: trying to get work done before 5:30 and go home]
Binder says, "Seventeen minutes!  CAN HE DO IT?"
mav changes her name to stormagnet.
Binder peers in to the 8-ball containing future.
Ryan has connected.
Binder [to Ryan]: Aloha.
Ryan waveses.
stormagnet does the wave
Binder . o O ( by herself? )
stormagnet . o O ( I'll do the @$#%#! Macarena if it means avoiding homework )
Binder . o O ( AAAAAAY procrastinataaaaa )
Binder . o O ( ... )
Binder . o O ( ..... )
Binder . o O [ dear grod what now? ]
Binder remembered!
Ever since stormagnet learned the kanji for 'homework', she has managed to use nearly every example sentance on her homework to beg for less of it.
stormagnet . o O ( it does not appear to have worked )
Binder [to stormagnet]: Beg harder!
Binder [to stormagnet]: That's the first rule of bad management.  If something isn't working, do more of it!
Binder lazily aliases stormagnet to sm so he can type less.
stormagnet wonders if Crag has headed out yet
Ryan chews some people out on the Wikipedia Object database discussion page
Binder says, "Huzzah."
Crag [to Ryan]: welcome back
Crag [to Ryan]: Devil is a friend of ours we know through Binder.
Crag says, "His full name is Devil Crayon."
Crag . o O ( it seemed like a good idea at the time )
You hear a quiet popping sound; Ryan has disconnected.
< Ryan has disconnected.  Total: 6 >
Crag says, "bleah, the lambdamoo logfile is over 8 meg, and I don't have flog installed so I can't rotate it without restarting the MOO."
Crag says, "grr"

Binder says, "GENIUS."
Crag says, "So, come on back whenever, folks"

SHUTDOWN()
==========

Syntax:  shutdown ([str <message>])   => none

Requests that the server shut itself down at its next opportunity.  Before doing so, a notice (incorporating <message>, if provided) is printed to all connected players.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.

=> 0
[used 3 ticks, 0 seconds.]
*** Shutting down: shutdown() called by Crag (#958): BRB ***
