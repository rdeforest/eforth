stormagnet says, "Nay"
stormagnet says, "But we got a nominee"

stormagnet says, "Alito was a tactical misstep- I don't think Bush stands a chance in hell of getting him confirmed"
stormagnet says, "Maybe I'm still Fitzmas-giddy, but I don't think the Senate is *willing*, at this point, to bend over and give him another Scalia"
stormagnet says, "Miers didn't tank because she was too moderate, she tanked because she was ridiculously incompetant"
stormagnet says, "All this *talk* of her tanking because of getting nuked by the radical right- now that's something that we WD40 lefties can use to our advantage, though"
stormagnet says, "So I won't blame the blogs for touting it"
stormagnet says, "Or rather- the radical right *did* nuke Miers for being to 'moderate', but they would not have been enough to stop her nomination, short of pulling a fillibuster"
stormagnet says, "Man, THAT would have been hilarious"
stormagnet waves to bill Frist, the fucking git

stormagnet . o O ( well, he does have deep pockets... )
stormagnet points Frist out to the barkeep, and orders a round for the House
Crag giggles
Crag says, "It's funny.  It's a lot easier for me to believe that bad things are happening than that good things are happening."
Crag says, "Three major hurricanes in a couple months?  I'm not surprised."
Crag says, "Major disruption of the conservative agenda?  No way."
Crag says, "it's even funnier since they're rather inter-related."
Crag says, "I guess I'm more of a pessimist than I realized"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Hmmm..."
stormagnet says, "Nicole just called me and apologized/scolded me for allowing me to walk back to the bus alone last night :P"
stormagnet says, "Which lead me to pondering cab fares"
stormagnet says, "King County sets a flate rate of $1.80 drop, plus $1.80 per mile, plus .50 per extra passenger... "
stormagnet says, "I think carpool cabbing might be a good idea next time we go out"
Crag says, "It's 10 miles to seattle"
Crag says, "So that'd be about $20?"
Crag says, "Or does the mile cost go up 50 cents per passenger?"
Crag says, "In which case it would be more like $25"
Crag says, "each way"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure it's .50 flat, but I could be mistaken"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I bet it's per mile"
Crag says, "I'm having a hectic day"
Crag says, "I want to keep this weekend as free as possible"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll clean the rest of the gutters"
Crag says, "Trim some bushes"
Crag says, "Mow the lawn again if the weather cooperates"
Crag says, "I think we should go on a picnic of some sort"
Crag says, "What sort exactly I don't know"

stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "Hiking!"
stormagnet says, "Nova is having an art auction on Friday that I told my mom I'd go to with her"
stormagnet says, "And there's that weird conference thing Sat-Sun, which I mayormaynot go to"
stormagnet says, "But you don't have to go to either"
Crag says, "Hiking sounds perfect"
Crag says, "Today has turned into a full-fledged mess"
Crag says, "About 100 tickets came in over a about 20 minutes"
stormagnet says, ""Auigh!"
Crag says, "What was it you were calling me about again?"
Crag says, "You wanted me to stop somewhere on my way home?"
stormagnet says, "Farmer's"
stormagnet says, "To drop off a check, if you have your checkbook with you"
Crag says, "I don't have my checkbook"
stormagnet says, "Then never mind :)"
Crag says, "I didn't even bring a jacket"
stormagnet noticed!
Crag says, "I think I can go home now"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I'm going home now"

Crag says, "The chocolate chips are my favorite part of the trail mix"
Crag says, "I bet you're sleeping"
Crag says, "I bet you're terribly cute, too"
Crag says, "with cats around you"
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, I did manage to nod off for a bit, and Marco tried awfully hard to keep me in bed"
Crag smiles.
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you like the trail mix :)"
Crag nodsnods.
stormagnet says, "Part of what was keeping me up was also a tooth ache, so I'ma see the dentist bright and early (7am GAH!) tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "And I can take my mouthguard in- AGAIN."
stormagnet says, "Speaking of which, I need to go take some more ibuprofin"
stormagnet says, "With some TEA!"
stormagnet says, "Did you bring your checkbook today?"

Crag says, "It never even crossed my mind"

Crag says, "I might have it afterall"
Crag says, "But I won't be able to check until Jean gets back from his meeting"
Crag says, "My coat is at my desk"
Crag lags something fierce
Crag says, "ah, better"
stormagnet says, "yeah, my connection has been kind of weird today, too"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "I called Cigna, got an Actual Person on the phone"
stormagnet says, "They a) confirmed that I actually never needed a referral to see specialists in our plan, just as I had always thought, so we can see a dermatologist whenever"
stormagnet says, "And b) switched our PCP to Dr. Dudley"
stormagnet says, "And c) They don't offer individual policies in our area, so we'll be stuck with SBRI's crappy Aetna policy when our COBRA runs out, DAMMIT"
stormagnet says, "COBRA should buy us 18 months, though"
stormagnet says, "HOWEVER, that means that you should factor increased medical costs into your asking price"
stormagnet says, "For instance, we'll be going from NO deductible to a $600 deductible per calendar year"
stormagnet says, "Plus $150 deductible for dental, also increasing from NO deductible"
stormagnet says, "I guess that's the inevitable trade-off"
stormagnet says, "Looks like the Aetna doesn't cover mental health, either"
stormagnet says, "Oh, no, they have an EAP that covers... 3 visits a year."
stormagnet . o O ( what the hell is the point, then? is it a state requirement to have *some* kind of coverage? )
Crag says, "I can't mentally afford to turn this job down"
Crag says, "I will try to haggle"
Crag says, "But I have no teeth"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I'm going crazy here"
stormagnet says, "COBRA will cover us for 18 months"
Crag hugs too
stormagnet says, "Maybe I can figure something out between then and now"
Crag says, "Red Elvises are playing at the Tractor soon"
stormagnet O_O

stormagnet says, "I've found multiple references to Tonks being "suprisingly heavy for their size""
stormagnet | These cats are firmly convinced that humans were put on earth to love them
stormagnet BWAH!s
Crag grins.
stormagnet | ....and delighting in games of tag with each other
Crag says, "That sounds like a match to me"
Crag says, "I wonder if Tonks in Harry Potter is based on a Tonkines cat Rowling knows"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet had wondered too :)
stormagnet | they do have a strong personality and can be stubborn, but they are so lovable it's hard to get angry with them
------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
"Do they talk a lot?"

This depends on your point of reference. If you have known a Siamese - not as much. If you are used to a sedate quiet long hair - a lot. Tonkinese talk in sentences and paragraphs. They tend to carry on conversations as opposed to talking to themselves. They expect you to listen.
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
Crag says, "Hm"
------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
"Do you comb their fur to get the little curly-cue on their chest?"

No. The cow-lick on the chest occurs naturally and I've never seen a Tonk without one.
------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
Crag says, "Does Marco have that?"
stormagnet says, "Oh-HO- as ifthere was any doubt, but still..."
