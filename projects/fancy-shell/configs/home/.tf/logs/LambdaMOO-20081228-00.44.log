Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

What are the main changes to a lambdacore born database so it works well with that ? Or have you a link for it ?

Most of our changes so far have been cosmetic. Mainly switching things from ASCII to extended characters that more closely match what they're supposed to be. We use left and right double quotes for saying things for instance. There still needs to be some core work done like making columnize work with combining characters. Right now it includes zero-width glyphs in strlen() to facilitate indexing into the string. I'll try to work on a page on http://codepoint.the-b.org/ to describe what core changes would be convenient for users.

It looks like you're off to a good start on a long over-due project. I got Japanese I/O without any custom settings.

Are you collaborating or sharing code with GammaMOO?

You are right about the scarcity of Unicode clients. The best I've found is Mud Magic: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kyndig

Subject:  Menu-based interface to mail folders?

As I've said before, I'm a wizard on an RPG MOO. Normal people in the game aren't used to typing lots of MOO-like commands, etc. We're wanting to create message boards. I figure, no sense reinventing the wheel, when LambdaCore already has mail folders. But, the number of commands related to mail folders is great, E.G. @send, @read, @reply and all its flags, etc. What I'd love to find is a menu-based system which allows you to browse lists to which you're subscribed, read messages, reply, etc. All within a menu which can be accessed by typing one command. We already have something which lots of MOOs have implemented, namely, $command_utils:menu for displaying a menu of options. Any thoughts?
Thanks.
