PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

For assistance either now or later, type `help'.

Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

TIME WARP UPDATE
The MOO is now in Slow Time, ticking off 9 seconds for every 10 seconds in real life.  This state of affairs will continue until somewhere around 9am today, at which point we'll be close enough to convergence that I can restart NTP.  

Do not rely on LambdaMOO for any critical timekeeping functions and enjoy the slowed-down RPG.

TIME WARP
We seem to be back on PDT or something (!@^%#$@ power failures; !@%$#!@ BIOS).
Current plan is for about an hour of downtime tonight (midnight-1am 11/26 PST) 
to deal with this.

MAIL ISSUES
Sometime this weekend, Speakeasy's outgoing mail server got marked as a spammer by some RBL (Realtime Blackhole List).  The mistake has evidently been corrected, but it's going to take another day or two for the various ISPs (including Comcast and Yahoo) to update their lists.  Until then, mail sent from here may bounce.

THE VOYAGE HOME

Expect some downtime this afternoon, most likely on the order of 30-60 minutes, while alberich (MOO server box) goes on a (brief) road trip.  If all goes well, we'll be back up via my new ISP, with mail and everything.  I'll do updates on lambdamoo.blogspot.com as things happen.

The IP address will be changing but DNS should deal with that for you.  However, if the blog says the move was successful and your local nameserver is still resolving lambda.moo.mud.org as the 67 address and failing to connect, and you can't convince your DNS cache to flush itself, try new.lambda.moo.mud.org.

LAMBDAMOO STATUS WEBLOG
Something I just set up which may be worth bookmarking:

  http://lambdamoo.blogspot.com  

That is, if you think LambdaMOO might be down/inaccessible, this *may* have useful information.  In case of downtime, it's where we'll be posting updates about what's happening and when we'll be back up.  

There is an Atom syndication of this at  http://lambdamoo.blogspot.com/atom.xml 
and something RSS-compatible at          http://feeds.feedburner.com/lambdamoo

NEW MAILING LIST *SITE-ISSUES
Rather than announce that we have a QWest/Speakeasy DSL install scheduled for tomorrow, which isn't necessarily meaningful since, as with the nature of all things (DSL/phone-company)-related, there's no way to know in advance whether it's indeed going to happen, I figured I'd instead create a mailing list

   *Site-Issues

where I could announce such things for those of you who are curious and/or care to follow along.  That way I won't be spamming *News (or at least, not until something genuinely HAPPENS on this front).

*Site-Issues would also be the canonical place to talk about LambdaMOO's various ongoing server-machine/connectivity/network/ISP issues, whatever they might be.  There are various questions I keep answering in individual mail; may as well have a place for them.

WE'RE BACK
Evidently, someone was determined to switch me over to the new circuit no matter what.  So they did, and this time for good measure they apparently ripped out some portion of the old circuit as well, so that's that.  And of course they did it right before going home for the weekend, so it took until Monday to find out just how screwed we are.  

As it happens, the modem lights are all green but there's protocol wonkiness.  Supposedly, an appropriate modem is on its way to me.  We'll see.  It's also possible that QWest will succeed (this time) in reconditioning my other line, in which case I'll finally be able to dump these twits, but until then it's anybody's guess what's going to happen.

For now, we're running elsewhere.  Still need to work out the mail environment, so $network.active is off for now (i.e., that's why @netforward is disabled and new-character registration is on hold, in case you were wondering).

Also since this is a PPPoE connection, I probably need to diddle with the MTUs (1500 is almost certainly wrong).  
Expect flakiness.

MORE COVAD FUN
So it appears Covad really badly wants to get rid of the DSL circuit that I'm on.  Somewhere around 12:40 today, some enthusiastic tech switched it off anyway, thinking there was nobody on it anymore.  Only took about 4 hours and 1 level of escalation to get it back --- which is somewhat worrisomely longer than the 15 minutes and 0 levels it took the last time this happened a couple weeks ago.  The IInet folks are now trying to work something out.

What exactly I'm going to end up with remains to be seen, but the bottom line is that sometime in the next month, my DSL service will change *somehow*, and it's probably going to be a bit more than just an IP change.  We'll see.  

I'm also guessing there will be at least one more such outage before this is all over.  Cross your fingers.

REAPERS ELECTION RESULTS
   The election to fill vacancies on the LambdaMOO Elected Undertakers and Executors has come to a close with the following results:

       Yes        No   Abstain   *   Candidate

The name(s) marked with a plus (+) or asterisk (*) above have acquired more `yes' votes than `no' votes; those marked with an asterisk (*) had the greatest spreads between `yes' and `no' and have therefore been elected.

POSSIBLE OUTAGE COMING UP
So far as I know, the IP changeover remains on the agenda for 4:30am tomorrow morning (9/17), but they *STILL* haven't told me what the new number is going to be.  Suffice it to say, if I don't get some kind of call tonight and they go through with it anyway, then we get cut off for a while.

NEW IP ADDRESS 9/17/2004
The Covad/IInet folks have rescheduled the IP switchover (see 'news 784') for Friday, 9/17 (I'm assuming 4:30am PDT, though they haven't explicitly said).

And once again, they're being slow about telling me what the new number is going to be.  The DNS record for new.lambda.moo.mud.org will update as soon as I find out.

NEW IP ADDRESS -- BEING RESCHEDULED
LambdaMOO will be *eventually* be getting a new IP address, but the Covad folks decided they didn't want to do it today after all.  More on this story as it develops.

NEW IP ADDRESS 9/1/2004
LambdaMOO will be getting a new IP address, due to Covad deciding to rearrange its network for some reason.

The changeover is currently scheduled for Wednesday 9/1, 4:30am PDT.  It shouldn't take very long (knock wood).  The server itself will probably be staying up throughout, but between me rebooting my firewall and the Covad people doing whatever they're going to do, all connections will necessarily be dropped on the floor.

There will also be a period of DNS confusion (i.e., before your own DNS server starts resolving "lambda.moo.mud.org" to the right place), during which time the following names will be available

   new.lambda.moo.mud.org  -- the new IP (as soon as I find out what it's going to be)
   old.lambda.moo.mud.org  -- where we are now

VOTING CLOSES ON BALLOT #61114
The voting period for Ballot:W4 (#61114): `Reviffle my Wiffle, Biffle' has ended.  The final vote count is as follows:
        In favor:   129
        Against:    69
        Abstaining: 46
The proposal has failed to get twice as many votes in favor as against and so has not passed.
