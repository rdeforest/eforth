A largely flat plain covered with speckled sand.  The dunes continue in nearly every direction.  The dark bulk of the watch tower looms immediately to the northwest, blotting out the stars.
You see a really big cactus, a web browser, and a web page titled "-- 'Aspirated' from web1913" here.

Southeast of the Firepoint Watch Tower
A largely flat plain covered with speckled sand.  The dunes continue in nearly every direction.  The dark bulk of the watch tower looms immediately to the northwest, blotting out the stars.
You see a really big cactus, a web browser, and a web page titled "-- 'Aspirated' from web1913" here.

Crag [to Ben]: if xterm is not installed but DISPLAY is set, your mcp scripts do unexpected things
Message 4 on Crag:
Date:     Tue Nov  9 00:42:09 2004 PST
From:     Ben
To:       Crag
Subject:  [rgm (#4177):  `could you take a loo']

Date:     Mon Nov  8 13:17:33 2004 PST
From:     rgm
To:       Ben

could you take a look at how much work it'd be to get the mcp stuff working with the latest tf?  I don't have a compelling reason to stick with TF 5, but I do like it.
--------------------------
Crag says, "I'm still on tf 4"
Ben says, "ah"
Ben says, "when is xterm not installed but etc?"
Crag says, "WHen I don't use xterm"
Crag plops himself down in the black sand between Ford and Charkes.
Crag says, "which is always"
Crag says, "i use pterm (PuTTy for linux)"
Ben says, "ah"
Crag says, "It looks like the MOO complains about a command not found"
Crag says, "But maybe it's xterm that wasn't found"
Barry idly wanders off.
Barry goes southwest.
Ben says, "I guess I could detect debian and use x-window-terminal or whatever the link is"
Crag says, "In any case, it took me about 30 minutes to figure out :)"
Crag says, "That sounds about right"
Crag says, "Just a note in the docs about editing local-edit.tf would be enough for me"
Ben says, "I use the screen mode about 99.99% of the time"
Crag says, "same here"
Crag says, "But I run screen inside ratpoison"
Crag says, "I use X because of der web"
Ben says, "hm, the second line of local-edit.tf calls out the xterm thing"
Ben says, "but no doubt the error handling sucks"
Crag says, "It does, but I didn't know to look there"
Ben says, "tf has had various flavors of it over time and I dont think I'm using the one you happen to have in your tf"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "Ah well"
Crag says, "My solution was to comment out the DISPLAY check"
Crag says, "because I wanted to fall back to screen"
Ben says, "yeah"
Ben says, "I have /unset DISPLAY in my .tfrc before I load mcp"
Crag says, "Ha!"
Crag says, "I could do that too"
Crag says, "I feel pretty foolish now that I have the whole picture"
Ben probably couldn't have helped too much since he hasn't touched it in so long
Crag says, "Yeah, that's why I never mailed you"
Crag says, "I wanted to give you a good bug report"
Crag says, "And before I had enough info for a bug report I had figured it out"
Crag says, "If I were to file one it would say "should check for xterm existing as well as DISPLAY""
Crag says, "but I don't think it's worth your time"
Crag says, "I'm probably the only person who uses tf, mcp, screen, vi, ratpoison and NOT xterm"
Ben says, "I'm sure what was happening was xterm was failing causing it to act as if you immediately saved"
Crag says, "I guess ratpoison isn't related"
Crag says, "yep"
Ben says, "you can't really check the exit status of an editor because some (notably vi) sometimes "fail" when you quit"
Crag says, "You'd need some fancy wrapper"
Crag says, "Which is a lot of work to go through for such a rare problem."
Ben says, "you are the first to complain :)"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Sorry about the login watcher spam :)"
Ben says, "wow, the oldest of those files was last edited in 1998"
Crag says, "yeah"
Ben says, "and that's the '2.x' version"
Crag says, "what a long strange etc"
Crag says, "I was looking in my words.tf and saw some commented lines from '94"
Crag says, "I've been MOOing for 12 years, maintaining a .tf/ directory for 10"
Ben says, "hearts.tf from 1995"
Crag grins.
Ben doubts he has any older, continuously un-edited files
Ben says, "(er, tf files)"
A wave comes in near your feet.
Ben says, "hey 12 years sounded long until I realized I've been mudding for 15 years"
Ben says, "we'll all be fun as 90 year olds"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "with our 70-year old jokes"
Ben says, "so old we really DO fart when bonked"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "We'll be dave dave daving each other and we won't know why"

The Black Sand Beach
The sand underfoot is black and jagged.  The ocean laps gently at the sand.  Ford, you, Charkes, and pj are sitting in the black sand.  A burgundy rug is here.  Matthew and Ben are sitting on it.  A silk buckwheat pillow is here.  Mordred is sitting on it.  A moss covered log lies here.  Marn is sitting on it.  A thick blanket of snow lies all around.  Deep tracks lead southwest and northeast.  A trail leads northeast to Fort Stalwart.  The sounds of boiling and hissing can be heard to the southwest, where you can see plumes of vapor.

HELP ON THE CARDGAME FEATURE
============================

commands:
 - joing*ame           [<game>]
    Join a game.  Usually the game must not have started yet.

 - quitg*ame|leaveg*ame [<game>]
    Leave a game.
    (Depending on the game, this may cause the game to end and reset itself.)

 - start*game          [<game>]
    Start the game.
    (Any player may do this once the game has an allowable
    number of players joined up.)

 - reset*game          [<game>]
    End the game and revert it to "assembly" state.

 - draw|take    [<count|cardlist>] [from <pile|player>] [for <pile>]
 - play|discard [<cardlist>]       [from <pile>] [to <pile|player>]
 - pass|give    [<cardlist>] [to <player>]

    Transfer cards from one place/player to another.
    Only some of these commands may be applicable in a given game
    The intended default usage:
      "draw" -- take cards from some pile on the table into your hand
      "play" -- play cards from your hand onto some pile on the table
      "discard" -- play cards from your hand onto some pile on the table
                   (defaulting to a "discard" pile if there is one).
      "take" -- defaults to taking cards from some other player's hand into your hand

    For help on how to specify <cardlist> do help on that deck
    (help on the game instance will get you to the list of decks in use).

 - pass
     This is often used for signifying the end of your turn, if, say, 
     this game is such that a turn can have multiple or optional actions.

 - bid [<bid>]
     Enter a bid (if this is a game that has bidding).

 - concede [<concession>]
     Concede the game or some portion (e.g., a hand) thereof.
     Whether this command is allowed and how <concession> is interpreted
     depends on the game.

 - gs*ay <string>
   ge*mote <string>
   g:<string>
     Directed speech/emote to other watchers

 - autoplay using <module> [in game]
   autoplay clear
   autoplay list
     see 'help autoplay'

Also, hands are sensitive to where they are; in order to play, you must be holding it.  If you give your hand to someone or something, that entity takes ownership and can play your cards from then on.  Dropping your hand is equivalent to quitting.

 I've got an itch do create something like CPAN for MOO.  This would obviously be an enormous undertaking with the potential to drasticly improve inter-MOO development and cooperation.  However, to be remotely useful, it needs to be done right, and I'm not yet equipped technically or disciplinarily to undertake this without first putting in a lot of time researching the issues and drumming up support.

Is anyone working on this already, or made any abortive attempts I could learn from?  Is anyone interested in taking this idea and running with it?

Thanks,
Crag

I still haven't scratched that itch... it's been killing me for two years.  I did try calomine lotion, but it didn't help...

I guess I better get right on that.

Subject:  first actual use of in-db parsing

Now my player class (#3333) reports the character at which errors occurred when an eval fails to parse.  The format is:

  Line x+y:  parse error
  1 error.

x is the line, y is the character within the line.  Both start at 1, y starting at the beginning of the actual CODE (not at the initial ';' if you use that syntax for eval).

x, of course, will always be 1, but it's traditional.

It would be sort of cool if there were support for other calendars, like the Jewish calendar, either on $time_utils or maybe a descendant of it.  There's a collection of calendar info at http://webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar.html.

P.S. Happy Hanukkah!

Don't forget:

  5) Let people deploy multiple armies in one command/message, rather than only one at a time.

And maybe also:

  6) If someone controls an entire island, they get an extra few armies depending on the size of the island...  And if you make at least one successful attack in a day, you get a card, which you can trade in as sets...  And if you want to do PERIL 2210, you can have underwater colonies and the moon!  And nukes and stuff!  Wheee!

Subject:  ok, collectables fixed

with some slightly grotty optimizations it now takes only ~40000 ticks to pick up an army when you're carrying 200 of them, so you should be able to carry 1500 armies without ticking out, which is more than you should ever be holding...

Subject:  spam reduction

In case this wasn't an obvious idea, I'll post it here for the record.  There should be a way to remove multiple armies from the box all at once, and there should be a way to deploy multiple armies all at once, rather than having to do them both one at a time.  Same goes for picking up and putting back in the box.

Also, it would be nice if there were a single command that people could use to ignore all PERIL output-- you could probably reuse the generic spammy object's verbs on the box and the armies or something.
