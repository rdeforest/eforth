NEWS FLASH!
MediaMOO has moved to mediamoo.engl.niu.edu at Northern Illinois 
University.  Many of the old addresses will still work, especially
those that start with purple-crayon, mediamoo, or media.  Please
be patient with possible outages in service as we tweak the system.

Subject:  Deeper Into Music

After much deliberation and frustration - well, one day's worth anyway - I've dusted off an old, unused computer that can barely write and save .txt files and set up a Live 365 server.  What's this mean?  It means that I'm attempting to run a little legal "radio station" in the background on  my connection.  It's not 100% yet and I'm still tweaking it.  But, if you feel  like giving it a test drive, let me know if it works for you.  I think I have a bitrate that will work perfectly for anyone w/a 56k modem or better and give decent AM Stereo quality sound.  

The computer's having a few problems keeping up from time to time, so there may be some skipping.  Just let me know how the stream sounds for you.  Go to http://www.live365.com and search for "Deeper Into Music" , with apologies to Pauline K.  You're be assured it's my stream if it tells you the stream is "owned" by Lumper5, my user name at live365.  Live365 provides cheap bandwidth for audio files that can be streamed with full BMI & ASCAP coverage from CARP royalty coverage for an amazing $5.00.  We'll see how long that lasts...  The direct link is:  http://www.live365.com/stations/lumper5 

I will leave it running most of Saturday and if it don't crash or burn or blow up, I'll leave it running for a coupla days to see if might work.
