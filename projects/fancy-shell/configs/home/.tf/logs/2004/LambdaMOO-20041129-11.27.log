Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Yes, the #define arm thing has bitten me on the Z too.  That's nothing compared to how hard OE will bite you ;-)  Anyway, your bison error may just be missing ;.  Newer versions of bison got strict about that, so I'm pretty sure I checked it into cvs a while ago.  Look for rule : ... | ... | ... ; and make sure the ; is there.  You used to be able to get away with starting another rule.

Subject: $object_utils:accessible_verbs(), line 7:  Task ran out of ticks

On $object_utils, in "accessible_verbs", at line 6, with arg `thing' an invalid object, "while ((info = `verb_info(thing, i) ! ANY') != E_VERBNF)" will run the task out of ticks because the E_INVARG that verb_info() will return is clearly always != E_VERBNF  

#3669:accessible_verbs, line 7:  Task ran out of ticks
... called from #153:_find_verb_lines_containing _find_verb_lines_matching, line 8
... called from #153:find_verbs_containing find_verbs_matching find_verb_lines_containing find_verb_lines_matching, line 33
... called from #217:@grep*all @egrep*all (this == #122047), line 31
(End of traceback)

Taking a coding trick from code that calls this, perhaps this should be done instead, (replacing lines 5..9):
"I use the arrow comments to delineate a block of replacement code";
"There is no need to include them, this, or the previous comment in the new verbcode";
"-->";
valid(thing) || raise(E_INVARG);
num_verbs = length( verbs( thing ));  "... caching num of verbs before for loop saves us ticks ...";
for i in [1..num_verbs]
  verbs = {@verbs, `verb_info(thing, i)[3] ! E_PERM'};
endfor
"<--";

Also, it might be wise for a $command_utils:suspend_if_needed(0) to be added between new-lines 7 and 8 (of the new verb, assuming my funky, single-line comments have been left out)
The verbs that call this are not always diligent about making sure this verb has enough ticks left to operate, especially for objects with large numbers of verbs (generics?, feature objects?, player classes?)
