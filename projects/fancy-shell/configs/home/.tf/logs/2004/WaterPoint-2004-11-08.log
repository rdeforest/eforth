Waterpoint: potentially dead[294]

*** Connected ***
#$#mcp version: 2.1 to: 2.1
Southeast of the Firepoint Watch Tower
A largely flat plain covered with speckled sand.  The dunes continue in nearly every direction.  The gleaming bulk of the watch tower looms immediately to the northwest.
You see a really big cactus, a web browser, and a web page titled "-- 'Aspirated' from web1913" here.

Black sand beach --- a minute idle, 25 people (19 idle):
    Topic: what?
     Perfect Tommy, Tobin, Becky, Absinthe, Ben, and Kenny (and pj, Joe,
     Chris, snooze, dave, rgm, Clay, Matthew, Marn, Charkes, wRog, Eclipse,
     Rob, Mordred, Dea, Starr, Tari, Ford, and carpediem)
1 party found.
The Base of the Firepoint Watch Tower
Wayne is here, daydreaming.
The Quiet Beach
You see a gold pezbuster here.
James is here, off in another world.
Fort Stalwart
Gaijin is here, asleep.
The Black Sand Beach
The sand underfoot is black and jagged.  The ocean laps gently at the sand.  Perfect Tommy, Rob, Ford, Charkes, Becky, Clay, and pj are sitting in the black sand.  A burgundy rug is here.  Matthew and Ben are sitting on it.  A silk buckwheat pillow is here.  Mordred and Tobin are sitting on it.  A moss covered log lies here.  Marn is sitting on it.  A thick blanket of snow lies all around.  Deep tracks lead southwest and northeast.  A trail leads northeast to Fort Stalwart.  The sounds of boiling and hissing can be heard to the southwest, where you can see plumes of vapor.
A sign here says, `Topic: what?'
You see a word server, yet another dictionary, Nasdaq, a composition/parentage/containment game, the URL trap, a Trivia Bee Questions with bad spelling, a horn of plenty, a WordNet (r) 2.0, a mud client for Mac OS X, the Creed of Freedom, a metermeter, a Potential Names for Fasteddie's Band, a box of silly hats, a can of heavy-duty idler repellent, a crate of masks, Marc's last moments, a Silver Linings, a stock boy, a fetcher, a radio, Abby, a Card Guppies game, and a distance calculator here.
Tobin, Perfect Tommy, Becky, and Absinthe are here, distracted.  Joe, pj, Kenny, and Ben are daydreaming.  wRog, rgm, Chris, Marn, Clay, Matthew, Charkes, snooze, and dave are dozing.  Starr, Rob, carpediem, Ford, Tari, Eclipse, Mordred, and Dea are off in another world.
Crag has arrived.

MCP

Rewritten from `help mcp-spec'[1] June 7, 1994 by Jay Carlson.  Comments solicited; send mail to the `@proj usability client MCP' mailing list, moo-cows, or private email to j@io.com.

The MOO Client Protocol is a standard for transmitting structured "requests" between MUD clients and servers.  The original specification is available as `help mcp-spec'[2], but the skeleton of a rewrite is here:

mcp-goals[3]
      History and goals of the MCP protocol
mcp-syntax[4]
      Syntactic description of MCP requests
mcp-semantics[5]
      Semantics of MCP requests

@EDIT-OPTIONS
=============

Syntax:  @edit-option
         @edit-option <option>

Synonym:  @editoption

The edit options customize the behavior of the various editors (mail editor, verb editor, etc...) to your particular taste.  The first form of this command displays all of your edit options.  The second form displays just that one option, one of the flags listed below.

The remaining forms of this command are for setting your edit options:

         @edit-option +<flag>
         @edit-option -<flag>
         @edit-option !<flag>           (equivalent to -<flag>)

These respectively set and reset the specified flag

-quiet_insert    insert (") and append (:) echo back the line numbers
+quiet_insert    insert (") and append (:) produce no output
-eval_subs       (VERB EDITOR) ignore .eval_subs when compiling verbs
+eval_subs       (VERB EDITOR) apply .eval_subs to verbs being compiled
-local           use in-MOO text editors.
+local           ship text to client for local editing.

-help-urls     The help system should display help as jtext.
-urls          Your client won't fetch and display URLs locally.

Tall, with brown hair and unearned unhappiness.  A fine layer of sawdust and a plume of sparks obscures your view of him.  His turns are standard rate and he is perfectly trimmed.  He has two eyes and an imposing thickness.  He is coherent and his latency is low.  His coefficients are scaled perfectly.  His gear reduction is free of backlash and his torque curve is linear.  He has low dispersion aspherical elements and focuses internally.
Ben is sitting on the burgundy rug beside Matthew.
Ben seems uninjured.
Ben is wearing no visible pants.  He is wielding a NERF gun.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 6 minutes.
Carrying:
 a box of imported stuff                 Object #6060
 Ben's generics catalog                  a crate of nifty objnums
 a bounds waif                           a NERF dart
 a scaleinfo waif                        some mars_utils
 a generic tabbed form container         a towel
 Ben's GPS unit                          a bullhorn
 a compass                               3 gold pieces
 a clear glass jar                       a stick
 a NERF gun                              a pear
 a robot dog whistle                     a blue frisbee

You know, 'Crag'.  From the old days.
He is awake and looks alert.
