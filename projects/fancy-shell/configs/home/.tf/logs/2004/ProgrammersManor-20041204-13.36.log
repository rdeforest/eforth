The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.
Ranger is here, distracted.

@PASSWORD
=========

Syntax: @password <old-password> <new-password>

Changes your player's password (as typed in the 'connect' command when you log in to the MOO) to <new-password>.  For security reasons, you are required to type your current (soon to be old) password as the first argument.

Your password is stored in an encrypted form in the MOO database; in principle, not even the administrators can tell what it is, though they can change it, of course.  It is recommended that your password not be your name or a common word; MOO passwords have been stolen or cracked in the past and characters have been made unhappy by such theft.  Your password is your security; choose a safe one.
