SweetTaters looks really confused!
You say, "Just that motherhood has many fearsome events and such, and that after all you've been through, three times, that I can't immagine what the dark could hold that would frighten you"
You say, "I find parenthood rather daunting."
SweetTaters ohhs.
SweetTaters says, "Hrm, lemme see..  you know that child labor hurts like hell, especially natural child birth which I had.. but there's no pain in total darkness."

SweetTaters grins.
You smile, "Which is great, by the way :)"
SweetTaters yays!
You say, "I remember when I was afraid of the dark, but I had very specific worries that had to do with scary movies I'd seen."
SweetTaters exclaims, "Yikes!"
SweetTaters says, "I never did like scary movies."
You say, "But I got over that when my real life turned out to be scarrier."
SweetTaters eeps.
You say, "Arguing parents are much scarrier than monsters in the closet."

SweetTaters sighs.
You say, ""
You say, "The only things that scare me now are abandonment and needles."
