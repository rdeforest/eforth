Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Sayonara IInet.  Just for grins, I'll be leave the old modem connected; may as well see just how long it takes Covad to actually pull the plug.  I predict that after a month of dithering about setting up a RADIUS server, they'll somehow manage to pull the wires in less than 48 hours.  Place your bets.

> I'm somewhat confused by this.  I thought Covad did the actual installations for Speakeasy.

who Speakeasy (or any ISP) uses for the line installation depends entirely on who's available in a given area and what they're charging.

I'm guessing Covad is not doing residential installations (in the sense of providing the line) for anyone, anymore.  What you see when you look at the CLEC (*) business, is a whole bunch of companies (e.g., Northpoint) that no longer exist.  This probably has something to do with the fact that, over the past few years, the regulations that made the CLEC business model viable --- particularly the ones that required ILECs (*) to make lines available at cost and thus kept them from undercutting the CLECs with their own DSL services --- stopped being enforced (thank you, Michael Powell) and at least one unfortunate court decision (thank you, US 2nd Circuit) made it impossible for the CLECs to sue to enforce them (because it was deemed that Covad et al don't have standing to sue anyone -- figure that one out.  The question of whether this is conservative activist judiciary at work or simply bought-and-paid-for-by-the-RBOCs activist judiciary, I'll leave for another day...).

Covad survives because they have other lines of business.  In particular, they are now an ISP.  They were *not* an ISP 4 years ago.  Meaning that IInet (also an ISP) is now a *competitor* of theirs.

Not only that, but Covad (apparently) also wants to be out of the CLEC business entirely; the sooner the better.

Both of which, I'm guessing, have something to with why, when I scream at IInet to get service restored, and IInet has to wait until M-F/9-5 to scream at Covad to get service restored, and then Covad just kinda sits there and goes, "Whut?"  

Contrast this with the temporary site, where Covad is the ISP and QWest does the line.  For its direct residential customers, Covad does 24/7 tech support.  When we thought the modem might be defective, they sent out a replacement and it arrived the VERY NEXT DAY.

(*) glossary

ILEC
  Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers.  QWest, SBC, Verizon,...  
  Otherwise known as "The Phone Company".  
  They own the copper, they own the central offices.
  Anything you want done with your phone line, they have to be involved somewhere along the way.

CLEC
  Competitive Local Exchange Carriers.  Covad, Northpoint,...
  They lease lines from the ILECs, rent space in the central office 
  where they can park their own equipment, and then sell DSL service.

ISP
  Internet Service Provider.  AOL, MSN, Speakeasy, IInet, Covad(now), 
  They have an actual presence on the Internet, own blocks of IP addresses, 
  run gateways, routers, mailservers, webservers, nameservers, ...

RBOC
  Regional Bell Operating Company.  
  Originally: NYNEX, BellAtlantic, BellSouth, Ameritech, USWest, SBC, Pacific Telesis
  Now:        QWest, SBC, Verizon, BellSouth

  A few more mergers and we'll have the original AT&T back.

So...  if your IP is in one of the blocks above, 
then my firewall is the reason you're not able to connect.  
In which case, there are two possibilities:

(1) it's in the first set (e.g., your IP is one of the RFC1918 addresses), 
    in which case it's not REALLY your IP --- something's doing address translation
    and you need to look at your firewall to find out what your *real* IP is, 
    i.e., the one you're using to talk to the rest of the world, 

    or if this REALLY IS your IP, I'm surprised you're able to get 
    anywhere at all with it, and you need to get someone to assign you something real.
or

(2) it's on the bogon list, 
    which will only happen if there's been a block of IP addresses 
    freshly allocated by IANA and your ISP happens to be using it.  
    Meaning it shouldn't be on the bogon list anymore.  
    Since these sorts of allocations happen maybe once every 6 months or so, 
    this is rather unlikely,... but if so, let me know.

It's also remotely possible somebody along the way is blocking port 8888.  
Try connecting to port 7890 or port 22 instead.  Since the latter is the 
SSH server, you won't be able to fully connect to it, 
but you'll at least get as far as the password prompt.

There are versions of traceroute that use TCP rather than ICMP
(ISP routers/gateways blocking ICMP is the usual reason ping and traceroute fail; 
actually, blocking ICMP causes a mess of other problems, too,... 
not that They seem to care).

Beyond that your ISP needs to figure out what's going on; in theory, that's part of what you're paying them for.
At worst, they come back to you with, "Hmm, we can't connect either.  Sorry,"
but even then they should still be able to do a traceroute from their gateway...

Subject: tangent re: icmp blocking

I work for dig.com.  A few months ago we added a couple Quest circuits in Seattle, and shortly thereafter we had obscure communication problems with our Orlando datacenter.  It turned out that one of our upstream routers had a different MTU from the other, and Orlando's blocking of ICMP broke Max MTU negotiation.  It took a couple dozen people 18 hours to diagnose.

This says a lot about our own disorganization, of course, but mostly it's another case against blocking ICMP blindly.  The case for blocking ICMP usually amounts to "Joe Hacker won't attack what he can't ping," which is BS because Joe Hacker doesn't manually attack anything anymore.
