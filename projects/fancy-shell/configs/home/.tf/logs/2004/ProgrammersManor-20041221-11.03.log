The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.
Minty is here, off in another world.

Minty          Reading Room in the Library   an hour                           

Total: 2 people, 1 of whom has been active recently.
You sit on the large maroon couch.
You say, "What a pleasant surprise!"
Minty licks, shags and stuff.
Robert hugs you despite your idleness.
You say, "Yay!"
Minty says, "How are  ya?"
You say, "I'm ok.  I'm on-call again, but that kinda takes some of the pressure off."
Minty says, "Ahhh."
You say, "how are you?"
Minty says, "I got a bit of lag, I'm downloading music."
You say, "yay music!"
Minty says, "I'm alrighty, thanks!"
You say, "What kind of music?"
Minty says, "I'm making a Christmas album, all country songs."
You say, "Neat"
Minty nods.
You say, "Grandma got run over by a reindeer?"
You say, "That's the only country xmas song I know."
Minty says, "uh, nope, Grandpa got run over by a beer truck."
Minty laughs.
You say, "heh"
Minty says, "But it's on the same principle."
Minty giggles.
Robert nodsnods
Minty says, "Yep, I thought I'd surprise you today."
Minty says, "yay me, eh?"
You say, "I'm definitely surprised."
You say, "Yes!"
Minty says, "thought you would be."
You see a player who is too experienced to have any excuse for not having a description.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 a MOOShaker                             a Goat
You say, "I think I'm going to have to give you a description."
Robert scratches his chin ponderously.
Minty says, "I should copy the one I have from sjr"
Minty says, "So what would you describe me like..?"
You say, "I'm thinking"
Minty says, "k"
You say, "I remember you said you have red hair, but I don't know if you said if it was straight or curly, short or long."
Minty says, "oh, it's long and sorta curly."
You say, "nice"
Minty grins.
You say, "Do you wear overalls much?  They seem like standard farmwear to my city mind."
Minty says, "Nah, never."
You say, "Boots?"
Minty says, "outside, yes."
You say, "I guess it would be silly to wear your boots in the Manor Library"
Minty says, "Otherwise, I'm barefoot in the house."
The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  You are sitting on it.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.
Minty is here.
Robert nods.
Minty nods.
Robert grins.
Minty . o O ( barefoot with toe rings, heh. )
You say, "Cute!"
Minty giggles.
You say, "Ok, thinking..."
Minty . o O [ uh oh ]
You say, "It won't be anything indecent."
Minty says, "whew!"
Minty laughs.
You say, "Not until we have some kind of clothing code implemented here."
Minty says, "Ahhh.. and that would be required?"
Minty gulps.
You say, "Required?"
You say, "no"
Minty says, "Yay!"
You say, "I'm not one for strict rules."
Minty won't run around naked though ;)
You say, "heh"
Minty [to herself]: be nice, k?
Minty nods.
Robert laughs
Minty giggles.
You say, "You're always nice."
Minty yays!
You say, "Still thinking..."
Minty says, "k"
Minty laughs
Minty says, "read what I put"
You say, "Would you say you're "strapping", as in "a strapping lass"?"
Minty says, "uh, strapping, like a big gal?"
Minty says, "Noooooo"
You say, "No"
Minty says, "Strapping.. like what?"
You say, "The dictionary defines strapping as "having a vigorously sturdy constitution""
Minty says, "Oh"
You say, "So like 'buff'"
You say, "only more old-fashioned"
Minty says, "uh no"
You say, "Oh ok"
Minty says, "You didn't look at the description I just put?"
You say, "Somehow I have this image of you carrying livestock on your shoulders."
Robert is thinking of a description for me, could be a while.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 a MOOShaker                             a Goat
Robert looks
Minty laughs.
Robert laughs
Minty says, "I am only 5' tall (or short), I can't carry livestock!"
Minty says, "Ok, so how can I undo the description I just set?"
You say, "One of my sisters is 5'.  She's definitely buff."
Minty says, "Ohhh"
You say, "Just replace it with a different one"
Minty says, "k"
You say, "You can @describe yourself as much as you want."
You say, "They're not cumulative."
Minty says, "yeah"
Minty says, "So you've read the one that I have in Netsville?"
Minty says, "Yes?"
You say, "With the change?"
You say, "the nickle?"
Robert grins.
Minty says, "I spelled it right!"
Minty says, "nickel!"
You say, "right"
Minty giggles.
You say, "heh"
You say, "I'm pretty bad about stuff like that :)"
Minty giggles.
Minty says, "wwell"
Minty says, "I did have it wrong first."
Minty laughs.
You say, "heh"
Minty says, "so I had to redo the whole descript."
You say, "Your description there is kind of abstract"
Minty says, "duh me."
Minty says, "Oh"
You say, "MOO has an editor, but it's kindof hard to use"
Minty nods.
You say, "And then there's cutting and pasting"
Minty says, "We didn't have to use the editor there for descript."
You say, "you never _have_ to, but for long texts it can be handy"
Minty nods.
You say, "ok"
Minty says, "Oh, we have the paste feature here now?"
You say, "short-ish, longish curlyish red hair, barefoot with toe ring(s)..."
You say, "Not that kind of paste"
Minty says, "ahh"
You say, "I just meant pasting "@describe me as ...""
Minty says, "Ohh"
Minty says, "hmm.."
You say, "So you can edit in another window or something"
Minty nods.
You say, "As I often do."
Minty says, "cool!"
Minty doesn't.
Minty hehs.
Robert is thinking of a description for me, could be a while.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 a MOOShaker                             a Goat
Minty says, "Ok, how about.. short sassy redhead, barefoot with toe rings. ?"
Minty shrugs.
You say, "Ooo, good start"
He looks craggy...
He is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 the friendly stuff                      
Minty says, "That was a start and a finish.. methinks."
Minty says, "I have lag again."
You say, "What about jeans and a flannel shirt?"
You say, "flannel for the winter."
Minty says, "I never wear flannel shirts."
You say, "No?!"
Minty says, "NOt even it winter."
You say, "I'm shocked."
Minty says, "Nope"
Minty says, "why?"
Robert shakes his head in dismay.
You say, "They're so comfy!"
Minty giggles.
Minty says, "well ya, but they're not 'me'."
You say, "What do you wear to keep warm?"
You say, "Sweaters?"
Minty says, "Uh, I usually keep the house warm."
Minty says, "Sometimes sweatshirts."
You say, "Ok, sweatshirts are comfy"
Minty nods.
You say, "I'm going for a comfy theme here :)"
Minty says, "k"
Minty says, "But what about Summer wear?  I can't wear all that hot stuff in the Summer!!"
Minty laughs.
You say, "Hm, I'm lagging"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Me too."
You say, "We'll just have to update you for the seasons."
You say, "I bet someone at my house is doing something to cause this lag."
Robert grumbles.
Description set.
Minty says, "So I'd have to change it twice a year??"
Minty says, "eek!"
You say, "Or more!"
Minty says, "Yikes!!"
You say, "But once we have cloths you can just change outfits once in a while."
You say, "clothes I mean"
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "Ok, I've put a new descri0ption on you"
Minty says, "k"
Minty says, "Woohoo!"
You say, "I like descriptions which only reveal things a person could observe quickly."
You say, "I need to fix my description too, I suppose."
Minty nods.
You say, "Gah, this lag is driving me nuts."
Minty says, "I never saw yours."
Minty giggles.
You say, "Mine is much too short."
You say, "Or do you mean on sjr?"
Minty says, "Yeah, lag sucks."
Minty says, "NO, here."
You say, "Ah"
Minty says, "Oh, just saw it."
Robert grins.
Minty says, "He looks craggy??"
Minty says, "What's craggy?"
You say, "Like Crag"
Minty says, "Like a hill?"
Minty says, "oh"
Robert grins.
Minty laughs.
You say, "I should get Raine and Kia to write a description for me"
Minty says, "Ahh"
Robert schemes.
Minty giggles.
Minty is a short sassy redhead.  She's currently barefoot, except for her toe rings.  She looks comfortable in her jeans and sweatshirt.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 a MOOShaker                             a Goat
You say, "Are you as energetic in person as you are online?"
Minty says, "For the most part, yes."
Robert nods.
Minty says, "Lots of days, I find it hard to sit still."
Robert grins.
Minty says, "I can't say I'm hyper, but energetic is good."
You say, "I like to be around energetic people now and then to perk me up"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Ya know.."
You say, "I'm a total sponge when it comes to that sort of thing."
Minty says, "I've begun to spend less and less time in sjr, coz they're all becoming so whiney and crabby.  Not much fun to be around anymore."
You say, "You'd mentioned that before."
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Taht place has really gone down hill the last year or so."
Minty [to herself]: learn how to spell, k?
You say, "It's the cycle of life :)"
Minty says, "that, even"
Minty nods.
You say, "I wouldn't mind supplanting that MOO"
Minty says, "Have you asked Quinn?"
You say, "You can bring any of the people you like here."
Minty says, "He hasn't been around lately."
You say, "I talked to him a couple months ago"
You say, "But not about his MOO"
You say, "We were talking about programming"
Minty says, "I would, but you'd have to have some verbs going on here, I guess it's what we're used to.  Not many people like the emoting thing."
Minty says, "Ahhh"
You say, "I wouldn't want to straight up replace the other MOO"
Minty nods.
You say, "I'd rather attract the good people and leave the icky ones behind"
You say, "Which is what I meant by supplant"
Minty says, "Well, it's not the MOO actually, it's the people that MAKE the MOO."
Minty says, "I mean the ones that go there daily."
You say, "Yes"
You say, "That's always true"
You say, "A MOO is just a very complicated chat room"
Minty says, "If the people aren't gonna connect, it's gonna go down hill, which is what's happening in sjr coz of the way people have become."
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Yep"
You say, "But if I were to advertise this place as a replacement I'd be overwhelmed"
Minty says, "People have forgotten how to have fun.. they take things personally now, much different that it used to be."
Minty nods.
You say, "I'd have to make _you_ a wizard!"
Minty eeks!
You say, "And then where would we be?"
Minty faints.
Robert grins.
Minty says, "Me?  A wizard??"
You say, "Stranger things have happened."
You say, "You don't have to be a programmer to be a wizard."
Minty says, "I don't know the first thing about it!"
You say, "It would just mean you'd have authority to ban people and such."
Minty says, "Ohh, and I would do that... how?"
You say, "I don't remember what the command is.  I've never used it."
Minty laughs.
-----
@TOAD
=====

Syntax:  @toad   <player>  [graylist|blacklist|redlist] [commentary]
         @toad!  <player>                               [commentary]
         @toad!! <player>                               [commentary]

Resets the player flag of <player> (thus causing <player> to be booted), resets the .programmer and .wizard flags, chowns the player object to $hacker, and removes all of its names and aliases from $player_db.

You must give either the player's full name or its object number.  Also, this command does not let you @toad yourself.

A message will be sent to $newt_log, containing a list of sites the player has connected from, and the commentary if you provided any.

In some cases you may wish to add the player's last connected site to the site graylist, blacklist or redlist -- see `help blacklist'[1] -- in order to invoke various kinds of blocking on that site (e.g., if player creation is enabled, you may want to enter the player on the blacklist to keep him from immediately creating a new character).  Specifying one of the listnames `graylist', `blacklist' or `redlist' will do this.

@toad!  <player>  is synonymous with  @toad <player> blacklist
@toad!! <player>  is synonymous with  @toad <player> redlist

There are messages that one may set to customize toading.  After all, a toading is (supposed to be) a rare event and you will doubtless want to put on a good show.  Thus we have

@toad  [%Nd %n:(@toads) %dd (%d#).]
  Printed to everyone in the room in which the victim is being @toaded.
  If you're worried about accidentally toading yourself in the process of
  setting this message, see above.

@toad_victim  [Have a nice life...]
  Printed to the victim.

These are pronoun_subbed with victim == dobj.

You say, "Ah, I found it.  It's @toad."
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "Like a wizard turning someone into a toad."
You say, "kinda silly"
Minty laughs.
You say, "There's temporary banning, and that's @newt"
Minty nods.
Robert . o O ( She turned me into a newt!  ... I got better... )
Minty says, "But I would also have to learn how to read connect sites, coz people can change their names, and come back in right away."
Minty laughs at you.
You say, "@@who"
Minty says, "Oh"

Minty says, "It tells me it's not a valid command."
You say, "That's 'cause you're not a wizard :)"
Minty says, "Oh, duh me!"
You say, "But if this place gets popular you'll be on the list of recruits."
Minty says, "But we can do that in sjr without being a wizard."
You say, "Different command, probably"
Minty says, "Ahhh"
Minty says, "We use @@who there."
You say, "It's getting to be about lunch time.  I'm gonna go grab a sandwhich.  It'll probably take me about 10 minutes or so."
Minty says, "And if my memory serves me right, I could do that before I became a programmer there too."
Minty says, "okies"
Robert hugs and stuff
Robert idles: fetching lunch
[Idling at 11:42 A.M. on Tue, Dec 21: fetching lunch]
Minty huggles.
Robert back
Minty yays!
Minty says, "I was onna phone."
Robert munch munch
Minty grins.
Minty says, "It's been so cold here lately."
You say, "Snow?"
Minty nods.
You say, "Yay!"
Minty says, "And winds.. had a WCF of -31F the other morning."
Robert!
Minty says, "Right now, the WCF is -20F"
Minty gags.
Minty says, "I"
Minty says, "hate"
Minty says, "winter"
Minty says, "!"
You say, "Aw"
Minty giggles.
You say, "Heh"
You say, "I suppose in large doses it's a pain"
Minty says, "I do, I detest it."
You say, "It's still novel to me"
You say, "Do you think you'll ever move?"
Minty says, "Nah"
Minty says, "It's where my roots are."
You say, "Your cold, frost-bitten roots"
Robert grins
Minty says, "My brother lives in Florida, but he's a wuss."
Minty giggles.
Robert laughs
Minty says, "I do like the 4 seasons, but I just am not terribly fond of the cold weather."
Minty says, "And this past Summer, it sucked.  It was cold and rainy."
You say, "Aw man"
Minty nods.
You say, "I like lots of sun"
Minty says, "Me too!"
Minty says, "And I don't mind the heat, I just don't like the humidity."
Robert nods
You say, "Summers in Santa Cruz are fantastic"
Minty says, "Coolies!"
Minty says, "No one even had a decent garden this past Summer, and lots of the farmers crops failed coz of the cold wet weather we had."
You say, "Farming is risky"
Minty nods.
You say, "My parents have been keeping a large garden for decades."
Minty says, "Cool!"
You say, "It's mostly just a hobby, but they take it kindof seriously sometimes."
Minty nods.
You say, "So I've absorbed a little of what goes into farming."
You say, "very little :)"
Minty yays!
Minty laughs.
You say, "Almost done with lunch"
Minty says, "k"
You say, "ugh.  Full belly coma"
Minty laughs.
You say, "I wish I could take a nap"
Minty says, "Pillsbury doughboy tummy now?"
You say, "yup"
Robert pats his belly.
Minty pokes it.
Minty nods.
You say, "hee hee!"
Minty says, "Yep"
Minty laughs!
You say, "So where were we"
You say, "MOO stuff"
Minty says, "uh"
Minty says, "weather"
You say, "Oh yeah"
Minty says, "which sucks"
You say, "Today it's gray here, but not cold or wet"
Minty says, "but that's neither here nor there, this is Minnesota."
You say, "Just mild and boring"
You say, "and depressing"
Minty says, "ahh"
You say, "yeah"
You say, "You're kinda hosed :)"
Minty says, "yeah"
Minty says, "sucks too ;)"
Robert nods.
Minty says, "I had to get a humidifier for this room."
You say, "I want to live on a boat and travel up and down the coast following the good weather."
Minty says, "humidity is only like 20%, and I've been getting headaches from it being too dry."
You say, "ow"
Minty says, "yeah"
You say, "That's way beyond my idea of fun weather"
Minty says, "yeah, but when you heat your house with wood, you get low humidity."
You say, "yeah"
Minty says, "And fuel oil is outrageous."
You say, "I bet!"
Minty says, "$1.69 per gallon."
You say, "gha"
You say, "We're on gas, but we have a fireplace too"
Minty says, "I just spent over $340 on 250 gallons."
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "Two actually.  One wood and one gas."
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "Is the wood easy to come by?"
Minty says, "Yep, get it off our own land."
You say, "That's good."
Minty nods.
You say, "work interruptions :)"
Minty says, "ahh"
Minty says, "S'ok"
Minty BRB
Minty says, "Ya know.. sometimes the instructions a person gets with things, are just plain stupid.  Like, this humidifier says not to place it on a surface that may become damaged from the humidity.  Do not set on furniture, don't set it on the floor if the floor may become damaged.. ok, so we suspend the sucker from the ceiling then?"
Minty laughs.
Robert grins.
You say, "The instructions that weird me out are the ones which warn against things I never would have thought of."
Minty nodsnodsnods!
You say, "I just get this image in my mind of some person making that mistake and then complaining about it"
You say, "It's sad and scary"
Minty says, "Yep, it is."
You say, "Work would be much more fun if I didn't have to do anything"
Minty says, "Yeah"
You say, "Some day I will retire, and then I will get a lot more done."
Robert grins.
Minty laughs.
Minty says, "The way the economy is, who's gonna be able to afford to retire?"
Minty says, "sheesh!"
You say, "Heh"
You say, "Those things are always temporary."
Minty says, "Ya, but just when you think things can't get worse, they do."
You say, "Also, the drastic increase in the speed of technology advances is pulling other cycles forward faster too."
Minty says, "true"
You say, "This situation will turn around, things will get better, and they will also get worse."
Minty says, "But, I was talking about what they said about social security for the baby boomers.. it's just not gonna be there."
You say, "It was always a scam"
Minty says, "Yeah"
You say, "it's a pyramid scheme run by the government"
Minty says, "I suppose, but you never know."
You say, "I always know :)"
You say, "I'm a genious"
Minty yays!
Robert spins his beanie
Minty nods.
Minty w00s!
You say, "I don't know much about the details, but the big picture is pretty clear to me."
You say, "Which makes me terrible at explaining my view"
Minty says, "Good, coz it isn't to me."
You say, "I still want to take a nap"
Minty grins.
You say, "I've been staying up too late, too"
Minty says, "I will, after dinner tonight."
You say, "yay"
Minty grins.
Minty says, "I get up way too early and stay up too late."
You say, "Yeah, but it works for you :)"
Minty says, "Sometimes."
Minty says, "I go through periods of insomnia, sometimes really bad."
Minty says, "But, meh, I survive."
You say, "Aw"
Minty grins.
You say, "It's that high energy thing"
You say, "You must be quite a handful"
Minty says, "Must be, I dunno."
Minty laughs.
Robert grins.
Minty says, "Maybe I'm a couple of handsful, but then I can't answer that ;)"
Minty laughs!
Robert laughs
You say, "Is it getting hot in here?"
Robert grins.
Minty [to herself]: I said be nice, k?
Minty laughs!
You say, "Don't hold back on my account."
Minty giggles.
You say, "I'm getting a headache now"
You say, "I think it might be out of sympathy"
You say, "or something"
You say, "I'm gonna take something for it"
Minty says, "I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea, but sometimes I tease."
Minty says, "k"
You say, "I don't think I could get the wrong idea after all this time."
Minty says, "whew!"
You say, "It's pretty clear to me that you're not interested in anything more than teasing and flirtation."
You say, "Which is great!"
Minty yays!
You say, "'cause I need the practice."
Minty giggles.
Robert gets headache mediscine now
Minty says, "k"
Robert back
Minty yays!
Robert grins.
Minty says, "Whatcha take for it?"
You say, "Acetaminophen"
You say, "generic"
Minty says, "Ahh"
Minty says, "I usually take Advil liqui-gels, 400 mg."
You say, "This is free, supplied by Disney"
Minty says, "They work fast."
Minty says, "Ahh"
You say, "When I buy something for a headache I buy Aleve"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Aleve is good too."
You say, "After my root canal I was on Vicodin for a while.  That stuff is fantastic."
Minty nods.
Minty says, "and addictive ;)"
You say, "If there were no consequences, that would be my drug of choice."
You say, "yes"
Minty giggles.
You say, "The best things in life are addictive."
You say, "Like love."
Minty says, "Yep"
Minty says, "Exactly!"
You say, "I just keep needing more and more love"
Minty grins.
You say, "I think I might take a week off next month to catch up on unfinished projects."
You say, "And to work on my resume."
