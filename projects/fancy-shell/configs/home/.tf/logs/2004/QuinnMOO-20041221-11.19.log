Crag's slope
This area is a mostly level part of what would be a fairly steep rocky incline.  Most of the stones are bare.  A few have moss growing in their shade.  Looking out and down, a broad landscape of forests, mountains, fields and streams is visible.  To the left and right the slope is too steep to be safe.
You see Crag's Solid Stone Class Container here.

I'm just a country gal. I love people and animals, love to have a good time and help out when I can. One thing you don't want to do is make me angry. If you do, I'll turn on a nickel and toss you the change.
