A largely flat plain covered with speckled sand.  The dunes continue in nearly every direction.  The dark bulk of the watch tower looms immediately to the northwest, blotting out the stars.
You see a really big cactus, a web browser, and a web page titled "-- 'Aspirated' from web1913" here.

HOW TO OPERATE A FERRY
======================

Instructions for operating ferries.  First, get to a dock and page or enter a ferry.  But, if you're reading this, you're probably in a ferry.  I'll include the instructions as they would be if you're a child of Ben's DWIM (#500) in brackets (if different) after the instruction.

>start with helm
[start]

(This starts the engines.  The engines will stop automatically when you dock.)

>launch with helm
[launch]

(This launches the ferry from where it's docked.)

>nav helm to <island>

(Example: "nav helm to icepoint".  This sets the navigation system to track to a given island.  The helm will be turned automatically.  Right now basic ferries can only go to islands.)

>throttle helm to 100

(You can set the throttle anywhere from 1-100 or so.  This will help you go beyond a snail's pace.)

While in transit, you should do "watch helm" to see your progress.  If you start heading away from the island, you've overshot.  This is especially easy with Tinypoint.  See below about adjusting your course.  Type "ignore helm" to stop watching.  You can also do "show beacons with helm".  This will show your distance and heading to the islands and other beacons.

In some cases (like going north from the Waterpoint docks), you may need to get into the open ocean by going due east (90 degrees) for a while.  (Note: north is 0, east is 90, south is 180, west is 270, and degrees in between these from 0-359 are possible.)

To do this, do "turn helm to 90" (or another appropriate direction) before setting the throttle.  It's beneficial to be watching the helm at this point.  set the throttle to 100, as above.  After a while, you can turn the helm to the bearing shown by the helm.

Final word: It's useful to be able to check your own progress on http://waterpoint.moo.mud.org:8080/ocean_map if you have web access.

That is not a valid command.
"forest" is not a valid navigational beacon.
Usage: navi[gate] to [beacon]
Navigation system will track Woodpoint island.
First start the engines, then set the throttle.
[with the ferry controls]
Crag starts the engines.  The engines rumble to life.
Setting the throttle above idle speed while still docked is dangerous.  Launch the boat if you want to go fast.
That is not a valid command.
[with the ferry controls]
Crag casts the dock lines off and pilots Ferry #1 out to sea.
Crag sets the throttle to 100 percent (477.3 mph).
Navigation system will track Woodpoint island.
Crag turns Ferry #1 to a heading of 237 degrees (southwest).
Crag pilots Ferry #1 into the harbor and docks.
Crag stops the engines.  The engines fall silent.
The Shore of the Lagoon
The sand is coarse and not very expansive here.  A set of thick wooden poles are set into the sand, forming sort of a makeshift dock for small boats to tie up to.  A driftwood log is here.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is hot and breezy.  A path up the lagoon wall leads southeast into the mainland.  The lagoon to the west beckons you to enter.  Ferry #1 is docked here.
Azure Lagoon (in the water)
The rocky lagoon wall describes a near perfect circle, about ten feet above the water, broken only at the north, where it opens up to the ocean.  Not actually named for the color of the water, which is more a murky greenish, it's claimed to have been named for the shade bathers turn when they spend too long in the frigid waters.  A passable shore is visible to the east.  The gentle curve of Barber's Falls rumbles off to the south.
