The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  The path continues southeast.  A sandy beach beckons invitingly to the northeast.  Another path leads northwest away from the coast, uphill towards the summit.  The coastal path continues to the north.

`HELP GPS' NOT FOUND
====================

Sorry, but no help is available on `gps'.  If you can't find what you're looking for, you may want to send mail (see `help mail'[1]) to *Bug-reports.

-----
TOPICS
======

A room is a place where talking can take place.  Sometimes, this talking is focused on one topic or purpose.  That is what room topic is for.  Currently, room topics show up in the "parties" list (see `help parties'[1]).

SETTING TOPICS
--------------

There are two types of topics.  One is the default topic, settable by the owner of the room, and the other is a part of the topic stack.

Think of it like this:  The default topic is carved into the wood of the sign while the other stack topics are slips of paper covering each other and the wood.  

To create a topic sign and set the first stack topic, type: topic <topic>
Note that this command doesn't work once a sign has been created.  Use the below commands then:

To set the default topic, type: carve <topic> on sign
To write over current stack topic, type: write <topic> on sign
To add a slip to the stack, type: cover sign with <topic>
To remove a slip from the stack, type: uncover sign
To remove the sign, type: remove sign
To clear the stack, type: shake sign

The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  The path continues southeast.  A sandy beach beckons invitingly to the northeast.  Another path leads northwest away from the coast, uphill towards the summit.  The coastal path continues to the north.
The Sandy Beach
A small beach with smooth sand.  A smooth path leads back to the coastal path to the southwest.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.
The ocean laps gently at the sand.

A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  There is a certain feeling in the area.  A rowboat is resting here.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.

You see fifteen of pj's armies and an altoid here.
You head underground.
The Underground
This place you're in is in sort of a twilight haze, and you sense that it's been a long time since it has seen either bright light or full dark.  What light there is comes from an undetermined source, and is muffled by cigarette smoke that drifts slowly through the air.  Inexplicably (on this sparsely populated island), a crowd and its accompanying din surround you, getting thicker to the north even as the ceiling gets claustrophobically lower.  A stairway offers some hope of escape.
That is not a valid command.
There seems to be an impermeable layer of crowd there.

You take in a deep breath of the fresh ocean air.
The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  A switchback path leads off of to the northeast.  A row of faded wooden planks lead up a dune to the northwest.  The coastal path continues to the north and south.
You see a bowl of bowls and coals and a black hole here.
The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  An isolated, grassy hill rises to the northeast.  The coastal path continues to the southwest and south.

The Picnic Area
A grassy, flat area near a cliff with a spectacular view of the ocean.  A nice fiberglass picnic table is set safely away from the cliff.  A wooden stool is here.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  The coastal path provides a safe means of egress to the southwest.
You see the packrat here.
A large, scruffy rat with a thoughtful look.
It is sleeping.

The Coastal Path
The smooth coastal path curves along the coast.  The cold ocean crashes against the rocky coast to the north.  The afternoon sun shines brightly.  It is cold.  The coastal path curves to the west and northeast.
You see fromliteral, a winkle shell, an URLmic, a linking book to Suspect, a linking book to Seastalker, a bucket, a bucket, a bucket, a bucket, and a pig here.
The packrat scurries over from the coastal path.
The packrat scurries west.
