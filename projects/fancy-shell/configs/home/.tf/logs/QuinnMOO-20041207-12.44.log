Crag's slope
This area is a mostly level part of what would be a fairly steep rocky incline.  Most of the stones are bare.  A few have moss growing in their shade.  Looking out and down, a broad landscape of forests, mountains, fields and streams is visible.  To the left and right the slope is too steep to be safe.
You see Crag's Solid Stone Class Container here.

(from Ranch) Minty pages, "Hiiii!"
You join Minty.
You begin to move into Ranch but encounter some resistance.  With a snap you're catapulted back where you came from.
Either Crag doesn't want to go, or Ranch didn't accept him.
(from Ranch) Minty pages, "I got lag really bad, I'm downloading music"
(to Minty) Crag blushes
Minty beckons for you to @join her.
You join Minty.
Ranch
You moved up the steps and across the porch, brushing the porch swing as you passed. Stepping into the ranch house you are welcomed by a cheery fireplace, which casts dancing shadows across the walls on cold winter nights. Rough hewn beams accent the corners and the ceiling and paintings of mountains, forests and lakes in different seasons hang of the walls. A leather couch and chair are arranged near the fireplace.
Minty is sitting in the chair.
You see Little Doggie here.
Dj (asleep) is here.
Obvious exits: north (north and n) and west (west).
You exclaim, "Yay music!"
You sit down on the Ass Cork.
Minty yays!
You exclaim, "ow!"
You stand up.
*** Ranch's security system has been activated. ***
"ass" doesn't work.
Minty laughs out loud.
Minty eeks!
Crag peers at the ass cork suspiciously
No one is sitting on the Ass Cork.
There's no such seat around here; try somewhere else.

You say, "ANd it's for a good cause"
You say, "namely, you"
Minty hides her face and plays with her fingers and scuffs her feet on the floor, and says, "Awww shucks"
Crag grins.
Minty asks, "Wait, am I in trouble?"
You ask, "Why?"
Minty hides behind the nearest piece of furniture!
Minty exclaims, "Oh, just coz!"
Crag looks puzzled
Minty smiles innocently.
Minty laughs.
You ask, "Would you like to be?"
Minty giggles.
Minty exclaims, "I'm kidddddding!"
You say, "Oh ok"
Minty winks, "Welll, it depends what kind of trouble ;)"
You say, "'cause if it's trouble you want..."
You say, "heh heh"
Minty laughs out loud.

Minty exclaims, "YES!"

You exclaim, "I doubt it!"
Minty yays!
Minty waits patiently for you to get on with it.
Crag laughs

Minty exclaims, "Yes, spank me!"
Minty wiggles.
You say, "it's not a very good punishment when you ask for it..."
Minty ohhs.
Minty snaps her fingers and says, "Darn."
Minty laughs out loud.
You say, "You're awfully tempting though"
Crag drools
Minty waits patiently for you to get on with it.
Minty laughs out loud.
Minty
I'm just a country gal. I love people and animals, love to have a good time and help out when I can. One thing you don't want to do is make me angry. If you do, I'll turn on a nickel and toss you the change.
She is awake and looks alert.

Crag sighs
Minty awwws!
Minty asks, "Why not?"
You say, "I think it's because I take it too seriously."
Minty ohhs.
Minty eeps.
<unidle: KingCapone (#5959) at 15:47; Total: 10>
You say, "I don't think you'd want that."
Minty comforts you and offers her sympathy.
You say, "Sorry to get so complicated and dramatic."
(from Pool Deck) Marcy spanks you!
Minty lifts your head and says, "s'ok.".

Minty asks, "Any more people go to your MOO?"
Minty ohhs at you.
Minty nods.
You say, "Devil added himself, but noone logs in still"
Minty ohhs.
You say, "It's a vicious cycle: noone logs in, so there's no reason to log in"
Minty frowns.
Minty nods.
Minty sighs.
You say, "It'll pick up once the holidays are over an I can spend more time there"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Yeppers"
You say, "Ideally I'd be spending four solid hours a day on the MOO"
Minty exclaims, "w00!"
You say, "With everything going on in the real world that's not realistic"
Minty blinks.
You say, "When I get home Raine and Kia pounce me and demand my attention.  I don't mind, naturally, but I am still getting used to it."
Minty says, "The whole world went to Hell in a handbasket a long time ago.. that isn't new."
Minty giggles at you.
You smile, "Oh I just meant in my world :)"
Minty pounces on you.
Minty giggles.

You say, "Yeah"
Minty nodsnodsnods.
You say, "I want a harem"
Minty yays!
You say, "Raine and Kia are down with my plan"
You say, "SO now I just need to find a few more..."
Minty asks, "oh?"
Minty nodsnodsnods.
You say, "I might need a bigger house."
You say, "Kia's running her new business (artspun.com) out of my house, so it's getting a little cramped."
Minty says, "Um, don't you ever get... worn out thoug?"
Minty asks, "h?"
Minty pokes her typist in the eye.
You say, "It depends."
Minty asks, "On what?"
You say, "As long as everyone is happy, I can always find energy to spare."
Minty ohhs.
Minty nods.
You say, "I think I'm much more exhausted by my job than by Raine and Kia"
Minty nodsnodsnods.
Minty hands Marcy some mustard to go with that spam.
You say, "If I didn't have to spend an hour and a half on the bus each day and deal with negative co-workers, I'd be much more energetic."
Minty nods in agreement with you.
You say, "Riding my motorcycle again would help too"
Minty nods.
Minty exclaims, "I love motorcycles!"
Minty drools out of the corner of her mouth.
You say, "Me too"
Minty exclaims, "And the drivers!"
Minty swoons!
You give Minty a big hug.

You say, "Raine and I rode a lot when she lived in Santa Cruz with me"
You say, "It was very romantic for us"
Minty awwws!
You say, "So I've known you for a few years now..."
Minty nods.
You say, "ANd I can't think of anything about you other than that you run a farm, you have three kids and a husband, you skiny dip, you have read hair, and I like talking to you"
Minty giggles.
You say, "I don't remember where you live, and I don't think you've ever told me anything else"
Minty says, "You have an excellent memory."
Minty says, "Minnesota."
You say, "er, red hair. :P"
You smile, "not read :)"

Minty nodsnodsnods.
Minty shivers from the cold.
Crag laughs
You ask, "So are you basically just a very private person?"
Minty says, "Well, no.. why?"
You say, "It only just now seemed odd to me that I think I know you so well, but I don't."
Minty says, "I'm not a private person, just like my peace and quiet in the country."
You ask, "May I ask when your birthday is so I can look up your astrology?"
Minty ohhs at you.
Minty says, "August"
Minty winks, "Dat's as far as I go with that one ;)"
Minty laughs.
Crag laughs
You say, "So either a Leo or a Libra.  Hm."
You say, "You don't seem like a Leo to me"
Minty says, "Leo"
You smile, "I lose :)"
You say, "I'm still pretty amature at astrology"
Minty ohhs.
You say, "I think of Leos as being more dramatic"
Minty says, "I am definitely a Leo"
Minty roars like a lion!
Minty asks, "See?"
Crag cringes! :)
You say, "TO be fair, I'm a Pisces (March 16, '74)."
Minty giggles at you.
Minty says, "Ahhh"
You say, "Moon in Capricorn, Aquarius rising, Mercury and Venus in Aquarius, Mars and Saturn in Gemini, Jupiter in Pisces."
Minty faints on the floor!
Minty says, "That's all Greek to me, dunno how people understand it."
You say, "Or to translate, I'm fundamentally a servent, but appear to be focused on intellect..."
Minty ohhs.
You say, "My feelings are a restrained, my intellect and tastes are logical and analytical."
You say, "My approach to problems is two-sided and communicative"
Minty yays!
Minty ohhs.
You say, "My difficulties in the world are two-sided and communicative"
Minty wonders.
You say, "My gift from the universe is service."
You say, "that's the very short version."
Minty grins.
Minty winks, "It's still all Greek to me ;)"
Crag grins.
You say, "It's just a game anyway"
You say, ""
Minty nodsnodsnods.
You say, "So what about education, interests, ambitions..."
You ask, "Does your whole life revolve around the farm and your family?"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Basically, yes."
Crag grins.
Minty asks, "That's bad?"
You say, "Not at all"
Minty wipes her brow and says, "Whew!"
You say, "I think it's great, actually"
You say, "You're doing what you want."
Minty yays!
You say, "Not nearly enough people do."
Minty nodsnodsnods.
Minty says, "That, I am."
You say, "I'm doing what I want too, but not enough of it"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "NOt enough time in a day."
You say, "Oh, my boss's boss's boss is here.  I need to look busy"
You smile, "I'll be idle a bit :)"
Minty says, "ok"

Minty comforts you and offers her sympathy.
Minty nodsnodsnods.
Minty exclaims, "But then if you do that, you won't be able to moo as much!"
