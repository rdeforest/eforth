The Guest Room
Binder appears to be staying here.  A hammock is here.
You see a Generic Wind-Up Toy, Steve, a generic unit testable thing, a Shared Player Finder, the Touchy Feely Socials Feature Object, a Lunch Bag, a Binder's Eyebrow, a rack, a Scrabble board, a card, a timer, and a Sandwich here.
Binder is here, distracted.  Devil is dozing.

Crag says, "needed to re-open my log file :)"
Binder says, "Say you have an ext3 filesystem on lvm.  You can take a point in time snapshot of that filesystem to logical volume [dedicated for that purpose, obviously], run dump [which, of recent, is ext3 aware, yes, including journal-log aware] and write that file out to a device [tape, cd, dvd, whatever."
Binder says, "]"
Crag says, "Hm!"
 wants attention.
Binder says, "That dump will be smaller than a gzip --best or bzip2 of a tar of the same filesystem."
Crag gives attention to
Binder says, "And if you waste the cycles on compressing it, you gain only miniscule advantage."
Crag says, "wow, I wouldn't have thought so"
Binder says, "So it's very low redundancy and very compact."

Binder says, "The catch is that not all filesystems support dump."
Binder says, "reiserfs, notably, does not."
Binder says, "XFS does."
Binder says, "ext2 & 3 do."
Crag nods.
Binder dunno about JFS.
Binder says, "HFS & HFS+ [os x] do not.  UFS [os x, *bsd] does."
Binder says, "ffs [*bsd] does."
Binder says, "ntfs does not, fat* does not."
 wants attention.
Binder says, "So, if one is in a position to say Fuck Windows, dump is a pretty good format for dump AND restore."
Binder says, "Because the dump is preceded by an index table."
Binder says, "So if you know what fs/dir/file you want to restore, it's fast to restore."
Binder says, "Limited only by your device read speed."
Binder says, "The trade off is that to create that index it's sloooow starting."
Binder says, "ie, you will want to do it automatically at night while you are doing more important things and don't have to watch it."
Binder has some pending NA to convert all of his home systems to dump for backup.
Binder even has some ideas for his HFS+-only system.
Binder says, "Namely, using the hfs-aware rsync to mirror to a non-HFS device as a pre-dump step."
Binder says, "Oh, and the real beauty of dump is that because it maintains indexes of when it dumped and has various levels of delta, most of your backups will be relatively small."
Binder says, "Only the level-0 dumps will be sizeable."
Binder sighs.
Binder grumps.
Binder says, "This script."
Crag says, "I've been using the rsync+ln snapshotting backup method"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "It's probably inefficient, but I had to do something"
Binder says, "Yes.  It's better than nothing."
Binder is trying to ape production environment practices to get more experience at it.
Binder says, "While my data isn't worth money if I'm careful at home, I'll be careful at work."
Binder had gotten sloppy working at ML where they actively discouraged best practices.
Crag [to Binder]: I've wanted to do production practices at home for years
Crag says, "the only thing stopping me is priorities"
Binder says, "That's an interesting idea."
Binder says, "The only thing stopping me is money."
Steve
Binder says, "And Steve."

Crag heh
Crag [to Binder]: I'm not counting the hardware part
Binder says, "But I have allocated money from my pending tax refund for the needed hardware."
Crag says, "good deal"
Binder is going to buy an external fast HD and some rewriteable media device.
do
Binder is thinking DVD-something.  DVD-RAM, if I can find it.
Binder says, "Since it's got 10^5 rewrites."
Binder says, "DVD[-/+]RW if DVD-RAM is hard to find, because 10^3 rewrites is still pretty good."
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I'm going to use SCA interface drives as my removable media"
Crag says, "If I can get Linux to tolerate me hot-swapping them, that is"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "That's a good idea."
do
Crag says, "I have three six-slot drive enclosures for the sparc and extra drive trays"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I haven't figured out what to do about labeling, though"

Steve
Crag [to Steve]: You can't help me with my backups
Binder pets Steve.
Steve looks at Steven adoringly.
Binder says, "What I want to be doing is automatic differential backups to rewriteable media, automatic periodic offsite data transfers [perhaps to Cerebus's system in Chicago] and aperiodic restore tests."
Binder says, "So I can be confident that I've got it covered."
Crag says, "That sounds good to me"
Crag says, "And it's more or less what I had in mind for the combined thatsnice.org/the-kgb.com network I administrate"
Crag says, "ok, it's more"
Crag says, "not less"
Crag says, "But I think I would have gotten there eventually :)"
Crag s/think/hope
Binder says, "My key goals are for the backups to be [a] low-attention from me once set up & [b] useful for recovery."
Binder says, "So there are probably other ways to get there, this is just the way which seems most robust and achievable for me."
Crag nods.
Binder has been doing manual burns to CD & DVD and even used them to recover Vy's data when her hd died.
Binder says, "But it's been a hassle and the most recent backup wasn't very recent because of the hassle."
Binder says, "Also wasn't thorough, she lost some email she needed because she didn't know where to find it and how to back it up and I hadn't been doing it for her."
Crag says, "My motivation to setup backups has been that I'm afraid to do anything interesting on my server because I've lost so much over the last seven years."
Binder says, "That's a valid motive."
Crag says, "Using subversion to manage my home directories has helped a bit"
Crag says, "but it's not enough"
Crag says, "AND"
Crag says, "if I setup the backups well enough my transition to a Xen-based server will be much less frightening"
Binder nods.
Binder jellus.
Binder says, "Sparky got a soekris before I could!"
Binder idles: paripatetic.
Crag idles: idling is the new black
[Idling at 6:41 P.M. on Thu, Mar 9: idling is the new black]
Binder is the new black!
Binder stabs Crag with a Leatherman blade.  Neat!

Devil . o O ( bucket of meat and cheese )
Devil [to Binder]: it sounds, i think, like you might want to look at amanda and http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/cdrw-taper
Binder [to Devil]: Yes, I'm aware of both of those things.
Binder [to Devil]: But it may or may not suit my needs.
Devil [to Binder]: after one of the rouds of updates i lost the ability to use the simple ncurses taper backup i had been using and now it appears to be gone from the deb archives
Binder [to Devil]: The bastards!
Devil [to Binder]: THough, now that the sudo problem has been uncovered, i am thinking maybe that's why it (taper) was segfaulting on me
Binder possibly.
Binder says, "Possibly, even."
Steve
Binder says, "I think Amanda is good when I can deploy agents, so that works well for my Linux systems, sort of."
Binder says, "But then I have the active-filesystem problem."
Binder says, "Which is why I like the LVM-snapshot + dump solution."
Devil nods
do
Devil . o O (  Steve  ...  do  ??? )
Binder says, "Steve is a little deranged."
Binder picks up the Binder's Eyebrow.

Devil takes a bite out of the Carrot sticks
Binder sighs.
Binder wishes he had fewer things of interest.
Binder says, "If I found more things boring I would have developed actual eating on here by now."
Devil [to Binder]: ahhh. building taper from source worked!
Binder says, "AWESOME."
Binder [to Devil]: Go you!
Binder thinks about doing some work.
Binder says, "Naaaaah."
Devil says, "it doesn't segfault and it appears to be interacting with the tape"
Binder pumps his fist in the air.
Binder [to Devil]: You rock!
Devil says, "and i only had to install like 8 packages so his sgml2txt reguirments would work!"
Binder snickers.
Devil | http://packages.debian.org/stable/text/linuxdoc-tools and it's depends
Devil says, "and then groff and it's"
Binder says, "That's ... silly."
Binder says, "Maybe that's why it got dropped from the Debian archive, stupid dependencies."
Devil [to Binder]: I think prolly because it hasn't been updated and pDrolly has bugs
Binder nods.

Binder says, "Caffeine?"

Devil says, "something"
Binder [to Devil]: Maybe you should stab Crag.
Steve
Binder [to Devil]: Or Steve.
Devil pouts
Devil says, "I cant stab Steve"
Binder knows.
Binder should fix that.

-------------------------------- finished ---------------------------------
The Guest Room
Binder appears to be staying here.  A hammock is here.  Devil is lounging in it.
You see Steve, a generic unit testable thing, a Shared Player Finder, the Touchy Feely Socials Feature Object, a Lunch Bag, a rack, a Scrabble board, a card, a timer, a Sandwich, a Binder's Eyebrow, and a Generic Wind-Up Toy here.
stormagnet, Devil, and Binder are here, off in another world.
Crag [to Binder]: I hope you don't mind us congregating in your room here
Crag . o O ( I'm glad I can spell 'congregating' this early in the morning, before my medication has kicked in )
Steve
Binder says, "Go ahead and flock."
Binder doesn't mind.
Binder says, "It'd be nice if there were more toys to play with, so I should probably make some."
Crag says, "I think when I do get Primordial MUD online I'm going to try to gateway it to Programmers Manor in such a way as to give the appearence of a seamless integration"
Crag says, "Partly so we don't have to re-write what little we've done here"
Crag says, "But also to demonstrate the value of BEM as a transitional model"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "That's a solved problem, too, protocol wise."
Binder remembers portals from the early 90s between tinyM*.
Binder says, "It worked by having clients recognize special text strings and reconnecting."
Binder says, "mjr's work with unterMUD was aimed at true cross-system object portability but never really took off."
Binder says, "Too much infrastructure work, not enough gloss, so no one really used it."
Crag says, "yeah"
Binder misses uberMUD and unterMUD.
Crag grins.
Binder says, "Nostalgiaware."
Binder says, "Oh, boy, two local exploits for Ubuntu 5.10 in the span of a week."
Binder sighs and updates.
Crag idles: work is hell
[Idling at 10:17 A.M. on Mon, Mar 13: work is hell]
stormagnet [to Crag]: I've been all idley, so I didn't see yopur posts in Leftist
stormagnet [to Crag]: Well done :)
stormagnet [to Crag]: I haven't caught up entirely yet, but I note that Metatron is living up nicely to my theory that there is some sort of principal of Head Troll In Charge going on here. My ire has gone Jane -> Fish -> Metatron
stormagnet pages, "psst... whatever> #1641"
stormagnet pages, "serious pot -> kettle"
Crag says, "WOO HOO"
Crag says, "I got a gold star at work!"
Devil [to Crag]: did you paste it to your forehead?
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "I didn't get an actual physical gold star"
Crag says, "My boss just told me I got one"
Crag says, "She liked the new passwords I made up"
Crag says, "And please don't ask me to explain why we have shared passwords for anything, especially for our password database."
Crag says, "It's a sad tale and someone would end up crying"
Crag [to stormagnet]: I have a plan for Friday
Crag [to stormagnet]: which involves me, my ego, and fixing myself.
Crag [to stormagnet]: and I want help :)
stormagnet [to Crag]: EXCELLENT
Devil [to Crag]: I don't need to ask. I know the answer and it is this: "It's Disney!"
Crag idles: hell at work again
[Idling at 11:20 A.M. on Tue, Mar 14: hell at work again]
Binder says, "Everyone knows it's Disney."
Devil says, "Hmm. I should email all the user accounts on fraser and see who's actually using email and disable the rest"
Binder says, "You should disable them all and re-enable people who complain.  ;)"
Devil says, "That's tho BOFH way to do it, indeed"
Devil says, "saves me trying to figure out how to automate mailing everyone"
Devil . o O (  for i in ls /usr/home  )

Binder shrugs.
Binder [to Devil]: Get down with your bad self.
Devil [to Binder]: but a subject line is probably a good idear
Devil says, "Done"
Binder says, "Yay."
stormagnet [to Crag]: Since you zapped Left> you won't see this link I just posted:
stormagnet [to Crag]: http://urlci.com/b6d197
Binder LAUGHS and LAUGHS at the Garfield lj link from Cyber>.
Crag [to stormagnet]: Disaster at work, I'll be late.
Crag mails himself that link to check out later
Crag idles: hate hate hate

Crag says, "The madness is on hold, but I'm not free yet."
[Idling at 7:05 P.M. on Tue, Mar 14: hate hate hate]
Binder says, "That should be on your family crest."
Binder says, "Or maybe I'm thinking of the House of Usher."

Binder screws around on wireless from the Ruby meetup.
Crag heh
Crag says, "I get to go home as soon as I close out of stuff and fill in my time"
Crag says, "12.5 hours!"
Binder  @@
Binder says, "That's a lot of bananas."
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "and rots"
Crag idles: why me
[Idling at 7:34 P.M. on Tue, Mar 14: why me]
Devil says, "Heh, and today i get a report from Tiger with a list of accounts it thinks are dormant"
Binder says, "Timely!"
Devil says, "yeah. now to decide how best to disable mail to them"
Binder says, "Well."
Binder shuts his mouth again.
Devil [to Binder]: yes yes. the BOFH way would be to delete the account. for i in `ls -1 /home` do user-del $i done
Binder says, "That wasn't what I was going to suggest.  First, anyway."
Binder says, "But I decided to keep my mouth shut because you're a smart guy and I'm sick and cranky."
Binder seems to have a cold, yet insisted on going to work, anyway.
Binder might be a jerk.
do
Binder is certainly behaving like one, today.
Devil says, "Yeah, I'll probably use one of the hashbased smtpd_recipient_restrictions optiens"
Binder says, "That's a good idea."
Binder says, "Not as good as deleting their accounts, mind you."
Binder grins with EVIL.
Binder says, "A possibly lazier and still evil way would be to create aliases of their account names, aliased to /dev/null."
Binder says, "Since alias resolution happens before delivery."
Devil says, "I thing ?_recipient_restrictions happen before delivery too, right? after HELO, but before message body? "

Binder gasps.
Binder says, "Shock.  Amazement."
