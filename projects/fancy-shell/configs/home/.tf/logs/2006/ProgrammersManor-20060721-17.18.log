Binder pages, "TWANG."
The Den
The Fireplace
The Prauge-Rahmmer's Parlor
The East Third Floor Hallway
You see a west wall here.
The South Third Floor Hallway
You see an Elevator Door here.
The Guest Room
Binder appears to be staying here, as his junk is piled all over.  There's a door in the north wall which exits back out into the hallway.  A hammock is here.
You see a Lunch Bag, a rack, a Scrabble board, and a timer here.
Binder is here, daydreaming.
Crag has arrived.
Crag says, "whee!"
Binder says, "Fun."
Binder says, "What was up with the reboots?  Hardware adds?"
Crag says, "all related to the drive failure a few days ago"
Binder aha
Crag says, "Some of the reboots would not have been necessary if I had planned better"
Binder says, "So I got to [a|the] root of my pvr problems."
Crag says, "Excellent!  Do tell."
Binder says, "Memtest threw multiple hundreds of errors in the first three passes."
Binder says, "At which point I decided: gosh, I don't think these are false positives!"
Binder says, "And it would nicely explain the weird behavior I've had from it recently."
Crag whuggles memtest
Binder gets segfaults on compile, segv running, weird skips, failure to load firmware.
Binder says, "It was when I got the segfaults on compile that I said: waaaaait a minute, I've seen THIS before."
Binder says, "Nicely enough, ubuntu installs a memtest image as part of its install."
Binder says, "So booting to memtest is a no brainer."
Crag says, "I noticed that, and was impressed"
Crag says, "Ought to help ubuntu folks shorten a lot of support conversations"
Binder says, "I think that I need to formalize my new system procedures to include a memtest burn in."
Binder says, "Oh yes."
Binder says, "I get new hardware so rarely I don't really have a process for making sure it's up to snuff before immediately putting it in to service."
Crag nods
Binder says, "The take away here is that I need to be spending more money on computer hardware.  :D"
Binder makes this case to Vy, gets nowhere.
Binder says, "But at least I've budgeted to replace the RAM and should be able to do so in 3-4 months."
Crag says, "I've been coming to a similiar conclusion"
Crag says, "I'm tentatively planning to build a gaming machine next year, if all goes well in the rest of life"
Binder says, "Luckily we live in a charmed universe where everything goes smoothly always!"
Binder whuggles the universe, is badly mauled.
Crag grins.
Crag bbl, moving home directory to a different filesystem
