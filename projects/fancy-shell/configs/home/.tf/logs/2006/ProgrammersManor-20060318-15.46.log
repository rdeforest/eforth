The Guest Room
Binder appears to be staying here.  A hammock is here.  Devil is lounging in it.
You see Steve, a generic unit testable thing, a Shared Player Finder, the Touchy Feely Socials Feature Object, a Lunch Bag, a rack, a Scrabble board, a card, a timer, a Sandwich, a Binder's Eyebrow, and a Generic Wind-Up Toy here.
stormagnet, Devil, and Binder are here, off in another world.

Binder eyes Crag.
Crag [to Binder]: screen process locked up
Crag says, "And it didn't seem to be a ^Q thing"
Crag shrugs
Binder says, "Weird but not unheard of."
Binder has had it happen 3-4 times in two years.
Binder says, "Often seems to be in the wake of some Debian package update."
Crag says, "Hm"

Crag says, "do, indeed"

Binder stabs Devil with a TheraSense FreeStyle.  Neat!
Devil stabs Binder with a boney elbow.  Neat!
Binder [to Devil]: WHAT.
Devil [to Binder]: goodmorning
Binder [to Devil]: Where?
Devil [to Binder]: somewhere!
Binder . o O ( mm somewhere )
Devil [to Binder]: probably europa
Binder says, "Jupiter's moon?"
Devil nods sagely
Binder eyes Devil.
Binder finally found a good use for secondary MX.
Binder says, "My internal systems aren't properly able to reach my MX because of the vagaries of firewalling and masquerading."
Binder says, "So they send out my root email via secondary mx, which just forwards it back to my primary mx."
Crag says, "That sounds kinda kludgy"
Crag says, "AKA Enterprise Class"
Binder laughs.
Binder says, "It's -convenient-, which means I should stop doing it and do something smarter."
Crag says, "Not necessarily"
Crag says, "Does it pass all its programmer tests? :)"
Binder says, "No."
Binder says, "My mail setup is not test infected, it is test dejected."
Binder makes sad test face.
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I bet XP could be adapted to system administration to great effect"
Binder says, "Possibly."
Binder says, "On a semirelated topic, I'm going to BALUG tonight."
Binder says, "Where the speaker is Tom Limonicelli."
Binder . o O ( or something with about that many vowels )
Binder says, "He wrote Time Management for System Administrators."
Binder says, "So it's like GTD for SA, I gather."
Binder is looking forward to the presentation.
Crag says, "Sounds interesting"
Binder says, "Yeah."
Binder says, "Damn, this Phantom BIOS shit in Rackable systems is cool."
Binder says, "It shows you, over serial [and thus over serial concentrators, such as the thinklogical ssh-serving serial concentrator we use] the whole boot process."
Steve
Binder pets Steve.
Steve sighs contentedly.
Crag [to Binder]: That is excellent, and likely to be cheaper, more reliable and more efficient than HP's iLO
Binder says, "Quite possible."
Binder says, "Though now I'm having a strange problem."
Binder says, "The server won't ... stay off."
Binder says, "I do a shutdown -h, I see it shut down ... and come right back up."
Crag says, "I am making HP OpenView my bitch"
Crag says, "And on a completely unrelated topic, since I switched to SpamAssassin I've received 161 ham, filtered 1106 spam, and a further 1170 spam which scored under 5"
Crag says, "And I'm supposed to have 1000 ham and 1000 spam to train pyzor"
Binder throws his hands up into the air and shouts, "WINNAH!"
Binder [to Crag]: Time Management for SysAdmins was a good talk and probably is a worthwhile book for you to consider reading because it is both short & useful for what your workday is like.
Crag says, "Nice"
Crag says, "I'll add it to my list"
stormagnet says, "AIEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeEEEEEEE!!!"
stormagnet EXPLODES with GLEE!!
stormagnet [to Binder]: YOU WERE RIGHT!!
stormagnet [to Binder]: HERE IT IS!!!

Crag says, "Earthsea trillogy rendered by Miyazaki?"
Crag says, "I might want to re-read the books before seeing that"
