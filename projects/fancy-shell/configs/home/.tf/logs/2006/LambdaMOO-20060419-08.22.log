Because I have been doing such a bad job as a wizard, I have decided to resign from the wizard staff of LambdaMOO.

MAIL ISSUES
Sometime this weekend, Speakeasy's outgoing mail server got marked as a spammer by some RBL (Realtime Blackhole List).  The mistake has evidently been corrected, but it's going to take another day or two for the various ISPs (including Comcast and Yahoo) to update their lists.  Until then, mail sent from here may bounce.

Being without UPS, we're currently at the mercy of every stupid power glitch, and we had one just now.
Sometime soonish UPS will be fixed/replaced, but until then I expect we'll be a bit less stable than usual.

THE VOYAGE HOME

Expect some downtime this afternoon, most likely on the order of 30-60 minutes, while alberich (MOO server box) goes on a (brief) road trip.  If all goes well, we'll be back up via my new ISP, with mail and everything.  I'll do updates on lambdamoo.blogspot.com as things happen.

The IP address will be changing but DNS should deal with that for you.  However, if the blog says the move was successful and your local nameserver is still resolving lambda.moo.mud.org as the 67 address and failing to connect, and you can't convince your DNS cache to flush itself, try new.lambda.moo.mud.org.

NEW MAILING LIST *SITE-ISSUES
Rather than announce that we have a QWest/Speakeasy DSL install scheduled for tomorrow, which isn't necessarily meaningful since, as with the nature of all things (DSL/phone-company)-related, there's no way to know in advance whether it's indeed going to happen, I figured I'd instead create a mailing list

   *Site-Issues

where I could announce such things for those of you who are curious and/or care to follow along.  That way I won't be spamming *News (or at least, not until something genuinely HAPPENS on this front).

*Site-Issues would also be the canonical place to talk about LambdaMOO's various ongoing server-machine/connectivity/network/ISP issues, whatever they might be.  There are various questions I keep answering in individual mail; may as well have a place for them.

WE'RE BACK
Evidently, someone was determined to switch me over to the new circuit no matter what.  So they did, and this time for good measure they apparently ripped out some portion of the old circuit as well, so that's that.  And of course they did it right before going home for the weekend, so it took until Monday to find out just how screwed we are.  

As it happens, the modem lights are all green but there's protocol wonkiness.  Supposedly, an appropriate modem is on its way to me.  We'll see.  It's also possible that QWest will succeed (this time) in reconditioning my other line, in which case I'll finally be able to dump these twits, but until then it's anybody's guess what's going to happen.

For now, we're running elsewhere.  Still need to work out the mail environment, so $network.active is off for now (i.e., that's why @netforward is disabled and new-character registration is on hold, in case you were wondering).

Also since this is a PPPoE connection, I probably need to diddle with the MTUs (1500 is almost certainly wrong).  
Expect flakiness.

MORE COVAD FUN
So it appears Covad really badly wants to get rid of the DSL circuit that I'm on.  Somewhere around 12:40 today, some enthusiastic tech switched it off anyway, thinking there was nobody on it anymore.  Only took about 4 hours and 1 level of escalation to get it back --- which is somewhat worrisomely longer than the 15 minutes and 0 levels it took the last time this happened a couple weeks ago.  The IInet folks are now trying to work something out.

What exactly I'm going to end up with remains to be seen, but the bottom line is that sometime in the next month, my DSL service will change *somehow*, and it's probably going to be a bit more than just an IP change.  We'll see.  

I'm also guessing there will be at least one more such outage before this is all over.  Cross your fingers.

NEW IP ADDRESS 9/1/2004
LambdaMOO will be getting a new IP address, due to Covad deciding to rearrange its network for some reason.

The changeover is currently scheduled for Wednesday 9/1, 4:30am PDT.  It shouldn't take very long (knock wood).  The server itself will probably be staying up throughout, but between me rebooting my firewall and the Covad people doing whatever they're going to do, all connections will necessarily be dropped on the floor.

There will also be a period of DNS confusion (i.e., before your own DNS server starts resolving "lambda.moo.mud.org" to the right place), during which time the following names will be available

   new.lambda.moo.mud.org  -- the new IP (as soon as I find out what it's going to be)

Upon passing of this petition/ballot, reapers' tasks will be redefined to- 
 
A) removing all aliases except the main name from a $player up for reaping
 (now held in a reap-hold stage), 
 
B) reaping $players who have specifically mooicided/requested to be 
 reaped and 
 
C) maintaining a maillist of objects(*Estate-Sale (#20993) available for ownership transfer from $players in reap-hold stage and those who requested a reap. 
Objects not picked up will remain with original $player.
 
No other $players will be reaped, including those in the reap process as of the time of ballot passage.
 
Definition of 'reap-hold stage' -
 
$players go into 'reap-hold stage' at the point in time when they would be up for reaping.
No player objects will be reaped, but upon a certain time of inactivity, the reapers can dole out the inactive player's objects for active maintenance.
Unclaimed objects and code owned by players in this status will be claimable at any later time. Objects stay with the owner but can be claimed at any time.
 
Clarification of requested reaping - 
 
Any player up for reaping shall be considered to have requested reaping if e mooicided and didn't come back before such time as e became reapable.  Mooicide shall refer to any approved method, which currently means, jumping off the edge of the world.
A mechanism shall also be implemented whereby any player may request that, in case e becomes eligible for reaping, e wishes to be reaped.
 
Petition rationale - 
 
Intent and Reasoning: The reap system is ineffectual and creates more problems than it solves. Please note this is NO WAY a reflection of the reapers, as they do a fantastic job given the constructs of the SYSTEM.
Reaping is no longer necessary to control db bloat. Note Link's evaluation tool for projections.
Items are currently recycled which should not be recycled. Verbs and code often break.
Items of great sentimental value have been recycled and brought back. Note the Garden of Forked Paths.

Well, .name is what shows up in @who and page and stuff, so MOSTLY you'd think people would know users from the name that is presented.  Of course some people swap around madly, but a lot of people just use one main morph.  Connecting by alias is merely convenient (e.g. I usually do "connect nos" rather than "connect nosredna", but I know my real name.)
