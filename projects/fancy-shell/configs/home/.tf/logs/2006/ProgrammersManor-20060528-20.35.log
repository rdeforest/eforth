Binder arrives from the Ballroom.
Binder is ... confused ... and ... disoriented.
Binder says, "Soooooo."
Binder says, "About that business relationship we have with Big Fish Games."
Binder says, "The one which is completely new and previously unheard of."
Binder says, "http://www.playfirst.com/game/mysticinn"
Binder says, "That's a game which they've had out for a while on other people's sites and now it's on ours."
Binder says, "I see there's no web version so I can't even vouch for its playability.  But, you know, the kids like it."
Binder says, "It looks a bit like Fate the Game."
Binder says, "http://www.playfate.com/"
Crag says, "I decided to pass on Big Fish because I have so many lines in the water already, har har"
Crag says, "in other news, mail was stalled on wrack for a few days due to ClamAV dying with messages about corruption or something"
Crag says, "The transition to a Xen VM seems to have included some file corruption here and there"
Crag says, "When I first started it up lots of things were segfaulting, but that went away after I futzed around a bit"
Crag says, "But I'm still finding odd things here and there."
Crag says, "The problem isn't bad enough to make me go back, but it's bad enough to make me worry"
Crag says, "I'm going to take wrack offline again tonight so I can move /mnt/hde3/* to /"
Crag says, "Might have something to do with the xen kernel being x86_64"
Crag says, "might be some weird library problem I caused long ago but didn't know about because I hadn't rebooted or something"
Crag says, "Things like this remind me of ways in which I'm not very good at system administrating"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Anything preferring wrack as an MX for us is stoopit."
Binder says, "Such as yahoo."
Binder says, "So if wrack stops answering, that's fine."
Binder says, "I'm sorry to hear of the Xen issues, though."
Binder says, "It's always a bummer to have a system go sideways on one."
Binder just did an extensive reworking of the company laptop disk partitioning.
Binder used the fact that it was a LVM device with ext3 filesystem to resize and move chunks of it around to break it up into easily digestible / amanda-back-up-able chunks.
Binder has been meaning to do this for several months.
Binder says, "It took all evening but that couldn't be helped.  It takes quite a bit to rsync XXGB of data around and almost as long to rm it from the origin point."
Binder says, "The resize parts are time trivial in contrast."
Crag says, "I've been using evms for these xen machines, but haven't taken great advantage of it yet"
Crag says, "I believe evms will be a big help once I get the configuration of all the real and virtual hosts into sync with my ideas"
Crag says, "I seem to remember hearing or reading that there's some performance advantage to not letting one's filesystems exceed 50% capacity.  Do you know if there's anything to that?  It sounds like a myth to me now."
Crag says, "I suppose I could test the theory"
Binder has heard that rumor, but from old school Unix dudes.
Binder thinks it may have been true for some commercial Unix instances but not with open source file systems.
Crag says, "That's what I think too"
Crag says, "the evms tools' interfaces are all very strange"
Crag says, "or seem so to me, at least"
Crag says, "they're not gnu-ish"
Binder says, "It took me some time to get used to lvm."
Binder says, "Now I find it almost intuitive."
Binder says, "It's got GNU-style switches and consistent command syntax."
Binder tries another go at compiling mythtv.
Binder says, "Earlier today my compile ... segfaulted."
Binder was extremely surprised and astonished.
Binder says, "In a bad way."
Binder goes hee hee hee at http://www.badgods.com/
Binder says, "Well, that's encouraging.  Compiled without segfault this time."
Crag says, "I caught on to LVM pretty quickly, I think.  And EVMS mostly makes sense to me architechturally.  It's only the UI of the tools I find strange."
Crag heh, lore
Binder nods.
Binder thought you'd dig on Lore's new project.

Crag [to the Wind-Up Mariachi Band]: ..
Binder laughs.
Crag says, "evms, lvm, md and xen can suck up a lot of time in the inital setup"
Crag says, "I've been triggering a large file corruption bug"
Crag says, "Which naturally leads to complications"
Crag says, "Ah, the corruption may be my fault for setting up a mirror consisting of partitions from a very small (6g) and a very large (160g) drive."
Crag says, "resulting in different block sizes or something"
Crag says, "heh"
Binder hms.
Binder says, "Yeah, I could see that being a problem."
Crag says, "google showed me the light"
Binder says, "You made a mirror of different-sized volumes?"
Binder says, "Or something less intuitive?"
Crag says, "Less intuitive"
Crag says, "Or rather"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I had two drives, and I carved out 2gig from each"
Crag says, "And mirrored those partitions"
Crag says, "But the segment size or whatever is different"
Crag says, "LBA and all that crap"
Crag says, "anyway, the doctor said "don't do that", and sent me home"
Crag . o O ( dr. google )
Crag says, "The conclusion I came to is that I should put my two identical drives in one machine and buy two MORE identical drives to put in the other"
Crag says, "and pricegrabber agreed with that conclusion"
Crag says, "saying, "that idea is less than $200 to implement - don't waste your time trying to make use of a 6g HD that's probably about to fail anyway""
Crag says, "pricegrabber was a big help in figuring this problem out"
Crag says, "It also told me that rather than worry how much memory my Xen domain0 is using, I should buy more ram."
Crag says, "ANd now it's time for wrack's host domain to get Dapper"
Crag says, "I do not expect this to affect wrack"
Binder WHEE.
Binder is currently updating his mythtv box to Dapper, as well.
Crag says, "good times"
Binder says, "apt-get estimates 18 minutes remaining of download."
Binder says, "I really think that I have no excuse for not maxing my RAM in every box I get from here on out."
Crag says, "yes"
Binder is currently setting aside money each paycheck for computer expenses.
Crag says, "that's good"
Binder says, "When the cup hits $200 or so, I'll pick up a new monitor and then the next $200 after that is mythtv RAM."
Crag says, "I've often said that people waste a lot of money trying to save money"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Everything is a lot cheaper now than I expected"
Binder says, "Especially for IT professionals.  Because the time we waste on systems we underbudgeted costs us money we could be making doing other things."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "$200 now can save us $2000 in headache time"
Crag says, "somehow it's always $200, isn't it."
Binder nods violently.
Crag says, "It's probably like the 4% thing"
Binder says, "That is something I have noticed."
Crag says, "$200 is probably the most people techies will spend irrationally. :)"
Binder says, "Computer hardware seems to always be about the same price but what I get for that amount changes from year to year."
Crag says, "yes"
Binder says, "Like, $50 seems to be the cost of a consumer grade WAP."
Crag says, "That's been true since some time around 1990, I think"
Binder says, "$500 the cost of a consumer prebuilt PC."
Binder says, "And so on."
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "I suppose the numbers might have been a little higher in '90"
Crag says, "but the principle is the same"
Binder says, "I guess the powers-that-sell have done the math to show that $X is the sweet spot for selling a FOO to their market."
Crag says, "All the more disturbing in light of inflation"
Binder says, "Actually."
Binder says, "It seems more consistent in Apple-land."
Binder says, "Their portables always seem to launch at the same price point."
Binder says, "But each launch has more features."
Binder says, "So it was sort of novel when they launched the mac mini."
Binder says, "Because it's the first mac I can remember which starts at less than four figures."
Crag says, "They must be feeling the pressure?"
Binder says, "I think so.  I think they are going in a direction now of attacking the low end market."
Binder says, "They want to eat Dell/Gateway/Compaq's lunch."
Crag says, "I'm in favor of that"
Crag says, "I vote yes for those three having no lunch"
Binder could make a lot of money betting what Apple -won't- do based on what HE would do in any given situation but they seem to be aggressively broadening out their market.
Binder says, "To the point that, like IBM before them, they're willing to cede some OS share to insure increased hardware share [ala Boot Camp]."
Steve Jobs says, "Go ahead and run your quaint little Windows thingy, just do it on my fru-fru looking hardware, bitch."     --Binder
Crag heh
Binder says, "Whee.  Download finished.  Now the unpack and install stage."
Binder hms at http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20041117115414383
Binder says, "So the direction I'm going with my work system is to set up my desktop [x86_64] as my X Application Server and use the laptop as a [smart] X Terminal where-ever I happen to be, though mostly at home."
Crag takes a look
Binder says, "I'll want to do stuff over ssh to feel safe about it."
Binder says, "And running a lean wm such as ratpoison [or fluxbox or xfce or ion2] I can probably not sweat the overhead."
Crag says, "I've run on a version of that setup in the past and found it satisfactory"
Binder says, "Using ratpoison or something else?"
Crag says, "ratpoison"
Crag says, "I've used other WMs over ssh, but only for stuff like testing stuff out for Raine"
Crag says, "helping her debug stuff"
Binder nods.
Crag says, "I haven't seen the XDMCP integration bit before though"
Crag reads
Binder isn't quite sure why Xnest is necessary in the equation.
Crag says, "ah"
Crag says, "I see"
Crag says, "It handles the XDMCP part"
Crag says, "I don't think you need that part"
Crag says, "WHat they're proposing would only be useful if the account one were logging into were a guest account"
Crag says, "But presumably one has already logged in before opening the ssh connection"
Crag says, "The only reason to add the XDMCP/Xnest complication is if the ssh session didn't require a login (public remote terminal or something?)"
Binder hurms.
Binder isn't convinced.
Binder oh
Binder hm
Crag says, "Maybe they don't know they can still get session handling and whatnot without gdm or whatever?"
Crag says, "They're using gdm to run Xstart or whatever it's called"
Crag says, "But they could just ssh -X remote.host startx"
Crag says, "ANd that would still give them their fancy desktop, skipping the gdm/kdm/xdm step"
Binder would have thought as much.
Binder says, "I can certainly try it out after I have my work desktop back up."
Binder says, "This weekend, my cube is being demolished and replaced."
Binder says, "With a smaller more brightly lit cube."
Crag says, "how ... nice for you?"
Binder says, "At the CTO's explicit directive."
Binder says, "Yeah.  Nice.  :("
Crag heh
Binder was like, "so how is this a win for me?" to his boss.
Binder says, "My boss said:  I fought against it, I know it sucks."
Crag nods
Crag says, "even the best bosses have finite powers of awesome"
Binder says, "I can sort of see the point of Xnest to grab ahold of the [xgk]dm interface for someone who changes window managers frequently and prefers to go full GUI."
Binder says, "But, over the public internet, that's going to be pig slow, I'd think."
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "And it will introduce other problems too"
Binder says, "Other fragile points."
Crag says, "Xnest is not a complete client or server implementation"
Crag says, "that too"
Crag says, "It might allow disconnection and re-connection, but I'm not even sure of that"
Binder says, "Like screen for X!"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "much promised, seldom delivered"
Binder . O o ( isn't that called ratpoison? )
Crag says, "If ratpoison included ^Td, I ... would be pleased"
Binder has been thinking about playing with WindowMaker again.
Binder says, "Yeah."
Binder says, "I keep meaning to play with ratpoison saved sessions."
Crag says, "I used WindowMaker for over a year without getting pissed off enough to look for a replacement"
Binder says, "It's got the ability to store a configuration and load a configuration."
Binder says, "But it's not really stateful."
Binder says, "It's more like 'run-these-applications' possibly with 'restore-this-geometry'."
Binder used WindowMaker for three years similarly.
Binder says, "WM was the wm I had backed away from all the others into until you showed me ratpoison."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "My love for ratpoison is probably unhealthy, unnatural, and possibly even unholy"
Binder rejects KDM, rejects GNOME, liked AfterStep until realizing WindowMaker was AfterStep++.
Crag nods.
Binder says, "Now I am intrigued by ion2 and fluxbox and matchbox but not enough to get me off of ratpoison lightly."
Binder may have to force himself into Doing Something with them to give them a fair trial.
Binder says, "Perhaps as part of my desktop-X to laptop-terminal efforts."
Crag says, "THe only thing that tempts me away from ratpoison is that some of the other wms have built-in scripting languages like scheme and such"
Binder says, "I can try creating my ideal working set of applications for my job and see which one gives me the least pain in configuring, starting up, shifting."
Binder says, "Though ratpoison is extensible, no?"
Crag says, "Sortof"
Binder says, "It has hooks."
Crag says, "Yes"
Binder says, "Maybe I will join a cult of elisp."
Crag says, "And it's all based on shell style interfaces, which is obviously The Right Thing TO Do"
Crag says, "I've been wanting to get into a lisp dialect for years"
Binder says, "IF I CAN'T EXTEND IT IN LISP IT'S CRAAAAP."
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ok, diner time"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "dinner, even"
Crag says, "diner time is later..."
Crag idles: diNNer
[Idling at 10:04 P.M. on Fri, Jun 2: diNNer]
Binder idles: zzz
Binder wakes.
Crag says, "Ever done anything with NBD (network block device)?"
Binder thinks.
Binder says, "No."
Crag says, "I'm wondering if I can do what I want with NBD alone or whether I need GNBD.  What I want to do is to have my xen guests only mounting networked stuff"
Crag says, "My options as I understand them are NBD, GNBD, NFS, AFS and ... some other network fs"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure I can boot from an nbd if I massage my initramfs"
Crag says, "or whatever it's called these days"
Binder says, "I've done nfsboot before."
Binder says, "It's a solved problem."
Crag says, "Yeah"
Binder says, "So if you're doing this on a closed network, nfs should do the trick."
Crag says, "I am, and I thought that too"
Crag says, "I was thinking to go with network devices in order to allow me to run ext2 or reiser or something on top of it"
Crag says, "rather than under it"
Crag says, "but I guess that's not necessarily helpful"
Crag says, "The Xen manual specifically mentions GNBD as a recommended way of providing mobile storage"
Crag says, "With iSCSI, SAN and NAS as lesser options or something"
Crag quotes
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
Currently, there is no support for providing automatic remote access to filesystems stored on local disk when a domain is migrated. Administrators should choose an appropriate storage solution (i.e. SAN, NAS, etc.) to ensure that domain filesystems are also available on their destination node. GNBD is a good method for exporting a volume from one machine to another. iSCSI can do a similar job, but is more complex to set up.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Crag says, "now that I look at it again, maybe nfs is TSTWCPW"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "Am I correct in understanding that this is all on one physical device?"
Crag says, "two physical devices"
Binder says, "OK."
Crag says, "I'm trying to setup that thing we talked about while at DIG"
Crag says, "where servers boot and pick up jobs as needed"
Binder says, "Then iSCSI is completely too heavy duty and probably even gnbd is overkill."
Binder says, "Gotcha."
Crag says, "nbd seems to be pretty light"
Crag says, "but NFS would probably be more robust"
Crag says, "but then, robust against what?"
Crag says, "It's not like these machines will lose contact with eachother"
Crag says, "I'm probably going to direct-connect them with a cross-over cable"
Crag says, "oh, and I still have this Sparc sitting here..."
Crag says, "not sure what I'm going to do with that"
Crag says, "not really worth thinking about that right now though"
Binder says, "Then I'd recommend gndb simply because it's Xen recommended meaning you'll have lots of documentation about any trickery involved."
Crag says, "I was leaning that way too"
Binder says, "All other things being equal, I'd go with nfs but since they're advocating gndb, that's what I'd do."
Crag nods.
Binder says, "But I have no experience with it, myself, so maybe there's some compelling reason NOT to use gndb and I don't know it."
Crag says, "I should scour the xen wiki before I commit any energy to it, probably"
Crag says, "you're always my first resource for this kind of thing"
Crag grins.
Binder has done more stupid software things for fun than anyone else he knows.
Crag says, "I liked your nfs->samba post in X"
Crag says, "sounds like the kind of thing I would only talk about but not seriously"
Crag says, "and something you would do because it's forward progress under the circumstances"
Binder nodnodnods.
Binder says, "My boss wanted to do something silly and so I came up with a silly way to do it."
Binder says, "The right thing would be to either [a] migrate all services to the new server and move the name with it or [b] migrate only the samba share stuff for now and have everyone point their shortcuts at the new path."
Binder says, "He wanted it both ways."
Crag . o O ( country and western )
Binder says, "Yes."
Binder says, "I think he'll probably do the worst of both worlds.  He'll move all services onto the new server but NOT migrate the name[s] with them so that everyone will have to change their shortcut paths."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "that's worse than me"
Binder nods.
Binder says, "I am much more of the school of giving each system a unique name but never giving that out publically, using it only for admin stuff, and setting up aliases for particular purposes."
Binder says, "So instead of telling everyone 'oh, yeah, the file share is on sprocket' I would be telling everyone 'the file share is on files [which is an alias for sprocket today and tomorrow will be an alias for formenos]'."
Crag says, "naturally"
Binder says, "But he's the boss so whatevs."
Crag says, "heh"
Binder has become a lot less insistent on doing things Right.
Crag says, "Some people have a hard time with abstractions"
Binder will do things Right at home and do things As Told for pay.
Binder says, "And when I am self-employed, they'll both be the same thing."
Crag says, "some of the folks at DIG have been talking about the possibility of (gasp!) not re-using hostnames"
Crag says, "So when replacing dumbsrv01, instead of building dumbsrv01-new and then doing two hostname changes, they'd just build dumbsrv02 and change DNS as needed."
Crag says, "but the responses to this proposal have been... irrational."
Crag says, "as you can immagine"
Crag says, "Er, imagine, even"
Crag says, "heck, people are frequently baffled by opsweb01 being linux and opsweb02 being windows"
Crag says, "as if the hostname has to imply the platform or something"
Crag says, "And I'm trying to get out as fast as I can :)"
Crag says, "gotta go pickup Raine, be back in a while"
Binder says, "Wild."
Binder is not surprised by the WDIG report, no.
Binder says, "Regards to Raine."
Crag says, "heh, she says hi :)"
Binder WHEEE.
Binder runs in a circle.
Crag says, "I'm rebooting wrack's host domain to allow it to adjust to the dapper upgrade"
Crag says, "be back shortly (hopefully"
Crag says, ")"
