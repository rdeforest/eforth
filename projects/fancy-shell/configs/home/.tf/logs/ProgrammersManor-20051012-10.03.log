So, I'm feeling super lazy and pissy tonight, so I decide that I want to pick
up food at the Subway, run by Nice Indian Man, right?

I'm in there and I'm looking at the menu and he's like "Chicken Parm, right?"

I'm like "That's what I was thinking before I got here, but now I see that
melt with the turkey and ham and bacon.  That's two forms of dead pig!"

"Oh yes, that pig, he was a mean fucker.  Deserved to die."

"Oh yeah?"

"Oh yeah!  Bit my daughter.  You should ask for double bacon to make sure you
punish him!"

I got double bacon and it was tasty.
