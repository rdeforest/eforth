Crag says, "I couldn't deal with it"
Crag says, "I'm getting hungry"
Crag says, "The proximity and expedience of McDonald's tempts me"
Crag says, "But I know Taco Del Mar is a better value"
stormagnet says, "Taco del Mar is healthier, too"
stormagnet says, "I talked to Martha- she called back"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to take the title down to Cap Hill with me, and then I thought you could sign it when you get off work and we could drop it off at a FedEx on our way to chiro?"
Crag says, "k"
stormagnet SQUEES!
stormagnet says, "Three new episodes of Mahoraba coming down the pipe!"
Crag says, "Heh, yays"

Crag heh
stormagnet says, "He got past it"

Crag says, "I haven't been playing with it, I'm kinda swamped at work"
Crag says, "ARG"
Crag says, "The tape library is pissing me off"
Crag says, "It seems to have a tape stuck in a drive"

Crag says, "This should not happen on a 1-year-old library"
stormagnet says, "Vet appointment made, 4:30 on Monday"
Crag says, "sounds good"
stormagnet says, "At that Cats Exclusive place on Aurora"
stormagnet says, "nearby :)"
Crag says, "The shorter the trip the better"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Precisely"
stormagnet says, "They're going to scan him to see if he's chipped, and check him for diseases"
stormagnet says, "I figured I'd get those fliers up and give them a few weeks before getting him snipped and chipped :P"
Crag says, "I suppose"
Crag says, "I'd say get him snipped anyway"
Crag says, "There's no sane reason for a pet to be fertile"
Crag says, "It's not like the animal shelters are empty or anything"
Crag says, "I have to reboot the tape library"
Crag says, "I can't believe HP puts their brand on this stuff"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, I'm with you on that"
stormagnet says, "But I feel like I should give them a fair Window of Opportunity"
stormagnet says, "For all I know, they're REALLY INCOMPETANT show breeders"
stormagnet says, "The Siamese in him can't be more than one generation removed, and sometimes crossbreeding is done on purpose to prevent inbreeding"
stormagnet says, "Even at one generation remove, he's still a bit crosseyed and kinked in the tail :P"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "The more I try to defend it, the stupider it sounds"
Crag says, "If they're that incompetant, they don't deserve to get him back uncut"
stormagnet says, "If he's not chipped, I'll ask them if they can fit him in"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And if they weren't that incompetant they wouldn't have lost him"
stormagnet NODS
Crag nods re: chip
stormagnet says, "okay, I'ma go shower now"
stormagnet idles: shower
Crag says, "I'm reading up on SAD and light thearpy on wikipedia"
Crag says, "It may be that the reason I didn't respond to the sun lamp is that I didn't use it in the morning."
Crag says, "I'm going to get one of those outlet timers at Top today"
Crag says, "And then try setting the light to turn on before my alarm goes off"
stormagnet says, "that's an awesome idea"
stormagnet says, "We should take a flier with us, too"
stormagnet says, "TOP is one of the places I was meaning to put one up"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I'm working on SSL for horde"
Crag says, "I've got SSL working, now I just have to get PHP working with it"
Crag says, "But yuo've probably left by now"
Crag says, "I think I'm done"
Crag says, "So https://mail.thatsnice.org/ works"
Crag says, "Except you have to accept the unsigned cert I made"
Crag says, "er, self-signed"
stormagnet says, "Can you believe I STILL hjaven't left?!"

Crag heaps on the guilt
stormagnet <- dumbass
Crag says, "I made no progress on my server builds today"
Crag says, "So you can join the club"
stormagnet says, "Tape library?"
Crag says, "But I did get SSL running"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Not just the tape library"
Crag says, "I did a lot of work avoidance"
Crag says, "I wouldn't have known the tape library was acting up if I hadn't been avoiding work"
Crag says, "I'm going to force the horde to use https://mail.thatsnice.org"
Crag says, "So now we can still use 'mail' and it will just redirect us to the right place"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "yays"
Crag grins
Crag says, "So I can (and am) use the horde from work now"
Crag says, "the 12th is for sure, but I don't know if I'll be on swing then"
Crag says, "It's up to my immediate boss to decide whether I will be trained on days or swing"
Crag says, "HA"
Crag says, "My work avoidance paid off"
Crag says, "Greg is going to upload RHEL3 packages to the install server"
Crag says, "So I can do a net install instead of CD"
Crag does a little dance
Crag makes a little love
Crag gets down tonight'
Crag makes a little typo
stormagnet says, "FUCKING AWESOM!"
stormagnet typos too!
Crag says, "I think I broke the horde a little with the url change"
stormagnet noticed
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet was trying to add more stuff to the calendar
Crag dammits all over the place
Crag says, "gimme just a sec :)"
Crag says, "AH"
Crag says, "missing quotes"
Crag says, "I took the jam/practice thing off my calander since we don't have a standard schedule yet"
Crag says, "I'm going to push for a regular schedule, but these are musicians we're talking about"
Crag says, "Is BYK going to end up being known as BYK if we keep him? :)"
Crag . o O ( Why do you call your cat 'bick'? )
Crag says, "I need to get oil for KT"
Crag says, "One downside of the horde wiki is that it has no way of sharing short urls"
Crag says, "Like http://wiki/SomeTopic"
Crag says, "The shortest link would be"
Crag | http://wiki/wicked/display.php?page=SomeTopic
Crag says, "I could set up a redirector though"
Crag says, "Redirect http://wiki/(.*) to https://mail.thatsnice.org/wicked/display.php?page=$1"
Crag tests his idea
Crag says, "gah, firefox had a cow"
Crag says, "But otherwise it worked"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "The operation was successful, but you lost the patient?"
Crag says, "kidna"
Crag says, "kidna"
Crag says, "GR"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "KINDA"
stormagnet says, "We need the typo mallet"
stormagnet says, "Badly"
Crag says, "Firefox gave me a warning about possibly malicious urls"
Crag says, "It might work better if it had actually been a redirect instead of a link I clicked on"
Crag says, "I'll experiment more later"

------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
The Japanese have an interesting sense of things sometimes, which never

fails to impress me. A balding man with a comb-over and lines of hair on

the top of his said is said to have "bar code hair," which is certainly an

interesting way to look at things. On one Japanese TV show I caught, they

touched a bar code reader to men's hair to see what amount came up on the

register, then they gave that amount of money to each man.
