NEWS FLASH!
MediaMOO has moved to mediamoo.engl.niu.edu at Northern Illinois University. Many of the old addresses will still work, especially those that start with purple-crayon, mediamoo, or media.  Please be patient with possible outages in service as we tweak the system.

**  Welcome to MediaMOO!  **

PLEASE NOTE:
MediaMOO is a professional community, where people come to explore the future of media technology.
 
The operators of MediaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to access MediaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints expressed here are not necessarily those of the janitors, Michael Day, or Northern Illinois University, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

While MediaMOO has historically limited membership to media researchers, in an effort to help newer generations experience the MOO, we now welcome teachers and their classes, as well as interested individuals. Our vision is to preserve the historic spaces in MediaMOO as a MOOseum while also creating new opportunities for building. A new area of the MOO, the City of New Media, is available for new building initiatives. 
 
If you have questions about MediaMOO, or wish to ask a MOO administrator about bringing your classes to MediaMOO, please contact our ArchJanitor, Michael Day at tb0mxd1@wpo.cso.niu.edu, or assistant janitor Susan Antlitz (a.k.a. Tiger / StormCloud) at SEAntlitz@aol.com.

Showing help on `@password':
----
Syntax: @password <old-password> <new-password>

Changes your player's password (as typed in the 'connect' command when you log in to the MOO) to <new-password>.  For security reasons, you are required to type your current (soon to be old) password as the first argument.

Your password is stored in an encrypted form in the MOO database; in principle, not even the wizards can tell what it is, though they can change it, of course.  It is recommended that your password not be your name or a common word; MOO passwords have been stolen or cracked in the past and characters have been made unhappy by such theft.  Your password is your security; choose a safe one.
