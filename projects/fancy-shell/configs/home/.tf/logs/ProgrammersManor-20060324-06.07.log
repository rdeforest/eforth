Binder appears to be staying here.  A hammock is here.  Devil is lounging in it.
You see Steve, a generic unit testable thing, a Shared Player Finder, the Touchy Feely Socials Feature Object, a Lunch Bag, a rack, a Scrabble board, a card, a timer, a Sandwich, a Binder's Eyebrow, and a Generic Wind-Up Toy here.
stormagnet, Devil, and Binder are here, off in another world.
Crag has arrived.
Binder [to Crag]: Hi!
Crag says, "Hi"
Crag says, "I think my problems with screen are related to windows, amazingly enough"
Crag says, "I was having problems on the wireless where I would lose net a few seconds at a time every few minutes, and my screen problem came up again while that was going on."
Crag says, "Ok, I guess it's not really a windows-specific problem"
Crag says, "But I blame windows for my net problems"

Crag says, "And I think screen is getting stuck in some state where it's waiting for something from a network connection which has gone away, or something like that."
Crag says, "Forced detach doesn't seem to get through to it"
Crag says, "I should see what changes there are between my version of screen and the one in unstable"
Crag says, "Hm"

Crag says, "The screen in unstable is the same as the one in stable"
Crag says, "I'll have to look upstream"
Crag blah blah blah

Crag says, "There hasn't been an upload of screen in debian since November of 2004."
Crag says, "heh, screen hasn't changed upstream since December of 2003"
Crag says, "oh well"
Binder says, "Sometimes a change in an underlying library [qv ldd `which screen`] will do it, too, for me."
Binder says, "Sometimes it doesn't work well for me until a [gasp] reboot."
Crag shudders
Binder nods.
Crag says, "Sadly, wrack has only been up for 14 days, due to that power failure we had"

Binder says, "Bummer."
Crag [to Binder]: how are you with regexps?
Crag says, "I thought I was pretty good until I tried to grep for lines matching To:\ .*[^\w]robert@"
Crag says, "But the .* is too greedy or something"
Binder says, "In Perl?"
Crag says, "I was trying to do it with egrep"
Crag says, "But it should be nearly the same regexp"
Binder is hot shit with RE.
Crag grins.
Binder puts together a test file.
Crag says, "What I was trying to do is find messages from addresses in my whitelist, but <xzynicole@thatsnice.org> was confusing my grep"
Binder says, "So you want To:<whitespace><anything>robert@ to match?"
Binder says, "And nothing else?"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "As long as <anything> isn't valid email address charachters"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "That is, To:<anything><at least one non-email char>robert@"
Crag says, "Good matches 'To: Robert de Forest <robert@defore.st>', 'To: robert@defore.st'"
Crag says, "Band matche  'To: Whatever <notrobert@defore.st>'"
do
Crag says, "Er, bad match even"
Crag [to Steve]: you're a little like Sancho
Crag [to Steve]: I feel like you're trying to tell me something but I have little hope of ever understanding you
Crag says, "I think I was high"
Crag says, "Because this is working fine:"

Crag | "^To:.*[^a-z0-9.-]robert@"

Binder nods.
Binder had just derived a very similar RE.
Crag says, "Er, %s/To:/From:/, but whatever"
Crag says, "It's been a rough... winter"
Binder says, "It's been a rough September."
Binder says, "IT'S STILL 1990 DAMN IT."
Crag heh
Crag says, "I need to restart my screen session again"
Crag says, "When I close a window now it tells me it couldn't update utmp"
Crag grr
Crag brb
