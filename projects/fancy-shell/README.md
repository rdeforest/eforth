# A Fancier Shell Environment for Fancier People

Making my shell environments (and those of others perhaps) do more right
things by default.

# Features

  - autocompletion
  - screen
  - ssh-agent
  - LANG
  - 256 colors
  - prompt
  - config mgmt (small-projects/configs)
  - staged config separate from git repo?
    - so that modifications don't show up in git status
