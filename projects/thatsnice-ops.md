# Todo

- Make spinning up new VMs a single command
  - Find out how to use Gandi API (assuming it exits, which it must, right?)
  - How to distribute files
    - Our own git farm?
  - How to test a host to confirm all's well?

# djb, /package, etc

## Modernization

  - Do something about http://cr.yp.to/docs/unixport.html#errno
