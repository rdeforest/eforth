Step 1: come up with a "board game" style way of representing data models and
their schemata.

# Who wants what, why can't they have it, and why do I care?

The "customer" wants
- persistence (store/retrieve)
- query (like this, but)
- frugality
- performance (low latency, high throughput)
- resiliance
