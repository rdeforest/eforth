# Coffee Browser: a more friendly and convenient CoffeeScript REPL?

The mission of this project is to bring the joy of 1980's BASIC programming
into the 21st century.

# Vision

The primary product is the static files which comprise the interface of the
toy. Interface should look like an old AmigaBasic session, except using
CoffeeScipt as the language instead.

We'll rely on other packages to do the heavy lifting. The scope of this
project is the glue it takes to create

 - an interactive environment with
 - high discoverability
 - high safety (undo, redo, version control)
 - low friction
 - minimal requirements
