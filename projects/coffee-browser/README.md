# Coffee Browser: a more friendly and convenient CoffeeScript REPL?

The purpose of this project is to bring the joy of 1980's BASIC programming to
into the 21st century.

# Vision

The primary product is the static files which comprise the interface of the
toy. Interface should look like an old AmigaBasic session, except using
CoffeeScipt as the language instead.
