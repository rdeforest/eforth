# I am 12 and what is this?

The XKCD comic above makes light of the severely fractured world of standards
in computing (though it may apply to other areas as well). This project
started as a joke based on Beach being a system a company used to hide the
complexity of the many protocols that third parties used to solve essentially
the same problem.

## Goals

[An explination of the Adapter, Facade and Bridge design
patterns](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/d67f0f913d795f703b89)

The first goal is to make it easier to make useful Beach-like multi-protocol
interface connectors.

The second goal is to make it easier to migrate away from obsolete protocols.

# Components

## Beach for the Rest of Us Continually Evolving

- BRUCE is the the project as a whole. 
- WonderBRUCE is the project's theory, design, protocols and standards.
- MightyBRUCE is the implementation: scafolding, tools and included modules.

## Field Evaluated Lightweight Testing

FELT is the test system.
