PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

Thanks, I fixed this. I turned off something to try to avoid the timeout, but I guess it didn't work. Oh well, at least the moo gets some excitement for a bit, even if it's at my expense.

Expect some downtime this afternoon, most likely on the order of 30-60 minutes, while alberich (MOO server box) goes on a (brief) road trip.  If all goes well, we'll be back up via my new ISP, with mail and everything.  I'll do updates on lambdamoo.blogspot.com as things happen.

The IP address will be changing but DNS should deal with that for you.  However, if the blog says the move was successful and your local nameserver is still resolving lambda.moo.mud.org as the 67 address and failing to connect, and you can't convince your DNS cache to flush itself, try new.lambda.moo.mud.org.

The server has been up for 18 days, 15 hours, 20 minutes, and 15 seconds.

FYI: I've been trying off and on since it went down and never got a connect. Yesterday I upgraded from a 2.4 kernel to a 2.6 kernel. Trying to connect today and imagine my surprise when it worked and I find Lambda has been up for weeks. This may explain otherwise phantom inability to connect.
