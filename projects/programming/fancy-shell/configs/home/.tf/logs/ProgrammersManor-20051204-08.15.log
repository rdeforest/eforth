stormagnet wavies
stormagnet won't be here long, but wavies anyway!
stormagnet says, "I went to go check my scroll, and realized I had none, for I had forgotten to log back in after the outage!"
stormagnet says, "WOE!"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME!"
stormagnet says, "Eddie Izzard on emusic!"
stormagnet | http://www.emusic.com/artist/11578/11578083.html
stormagnet says, "Wow"
stormagnet says, "We can get a complete backup power solution for about a grand"
stormagnet says, "That's not so bad AT ALL"
stormagnet says, "That includes a 5000 watt gas generator, installation, and a small UPS"
stormagnet says, "generator is between $600 and $1,200, and installation runs $200-400"
stormagnet says, "UPS on pricegrabber is $60-200"
Crag says, "wow!"
Crag says, "Would that be enough to power the house?  I wonder"
Crag says, "The computers are probably around 300 watts each, and there are currently four of them"
Crag says, "the sparc with all its drives would probably draw 500-600 watts if I got it running again"
Crag says, "So that's 1800.  The lights are probably 200-500 per room, so maybe 1200 typically, so that makes 3000"
Crag says, "If we didn't run kitchen appliances and such we'd be fine"
Crag says, "That's pretty exciting"
Crag says, "I wonder if our net would stay up if the modem had power"
Crag says, "I'm guessing it would"
stormagnet says, "Hiwstuffworks.com was what I used for a reference, and they said a 5000 watt generator is enough for a full house"
stormagnet says, "HOWstuffworks.com"
stormagnet says, "We wouldn't want to be running laundry and the dishwasher while watching TV or anything, but it should be plenty"
Crag says, "Heh, ShaoDeng is a woman"

stormagnet says, "Also, do you want to do Aikido classes with me?"
stormagnet says, "Tuesdays and Thursdays, 7-8:30pm"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "We usually have band practice Tuesday nights from 6:30 to 8"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "I can't eat the satsumas, they'd negate the Adderall"
stormagnet says, "CRAP"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry, I was half asleep when I made that ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "For that matter, until we get specifics on that Vitamin C thing, you're pretty much off the hook for ALL fruits and veggies"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I realized this morning that I was drinking orange tea yesterday"
Crag says, "Avoiding citrus is hard"
Crag says, "I'm pleased to see you up early this morning :)"
stormagnet says, "Plumber"
stormagnet winces
stormagnet says, "He DIDN'T CALL BEFORE COMING OUT, EITHER"
stormagnet dressed with record alacrity
Crag says, "Ahh"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Do you think berries and cream yogurt is safe?"
Crag says, "I already opened it"
Crag says, "nevermind, it has citric acid as an ingredient"
Crag sighs
stormagnet blinks!
stormagnet says, "godDAMN"
Crag says, "It's probably used as a preservative or something"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, we really need some specfics on that"
Crag says, "I'm going to do some more googling"
Crag says, "It pisses me off that all the ADD and Adderall stuff I stumble on assumes the patient is a child"
------------------------------- stormagnet --------------------------------
    * In addition, citrus juices, Vitamin C and foods that cause your intestinal tract to be acidic can reduce absorption and therefore effectiveness of this medication. 

------------------------ stormagnet stops pasting -------------------------
stormagnet says, "Heh"
stormagnet says, "Great minds think alike- I was googling when you posted that :)"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "I suspect the real trick will be to find a dosage that works for you, and then adjust it slightly to allow for routine intake of vitamin c"
Crag says, "Could be"
Crag says, "I took 20 again today"
Crag says, "because yesterday was so mild"
Crag says, "But now I wonder if that was because of the tea I was drinking"
Crag says, "Dr. Wood left me a voicemail yesterday morning asking for more information.  In retrospect I shouldn't have deleted her message, because I would have liked for you to listen to it and see if she sounds stern or something."
Crag says, "Because if you think she's fine, I'm crazier than I realized."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Maybe I could come to one of your appointments with you?"
Crag says, "I was just thinking about it"
Crag says, "about that"
Crag says, "I will ask her today if that's ok"
Crag says, "I wonder if the pudding is ok for me to eat"
Crag says, "Here's another thing"
Crag says, "I'm looking at the adderallxr.com website and reading their ADD symptoms"
Crag says, "hold on, work getting busy"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet needs to get busy, too
Crag says, "I decided to eat the yogurt anyway"
Crag says, "I'll go into it at length later, but my basic point about the symptoms is that the answer to their yes/no questions is not a simple yes or no"
stormagnet says, "But is it ever?"
Crag says, "Of course not"
Crag says, "But that doesn't negate my point"
Crag says, "Which is that just because I don't answer in the negative to a diagnostic question doesn't mean I have whatever problem that question is about in the way that is pertinent to the diagnostic."
Crag says, "HR says I can only count driving you to the oral surgeon as sick time if you couldn't drive yourself"
Crag says, "I know they mean 'because she is dopped up on pain killers'"
Crag says, "But I'm including 'because she has no driver license'"
Crag says, "It's those kinds of things"
Crag says, "No, she can't drive herself to the dentist, but that doesn't mean she's loopy"
Crag says, "Again, I'm not saying the diagnosis is wrong."
Crag says, "I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not convinced."
Crag says, "But I have an over abundance of doubt in all things, so I guess it doesn't matter"
Crag says, "I'm looking at http://www.adderallxr.com/adult_adhd/undiagnosed_adhd/adhd_symptoms.asp"
Crag says, "And I have almost ALL of them, depending on what the thresholds are"
Crag says, "But I could (and want to) argue against any of them being to a sufficient degree to merit concern."
Crag says, "I'm going to take their online test though, so maybe that will help me understand the thresholds and stuff"
Crag says, "The quiz doesn't give an answer. :P"
Crag says, "You can go ahead and ignore this whole monologue"
Crag says, "I'm just being a big dork"
Crag says, "I kinda feel like I'm trapped in the paradox that a crazy person might not know he's crazy."
Crag says, "But a sane person and a crazy person would both say they're not crazy."
Crag says, "and so on"
Crag says, "I saw on C-SPAN that the judge dealt a blow to DeLay's case by not rejecting the laundering charge"
Crag says, "So it's Wednesday now."
Crag says, "And I've just notice I've been starting a lot of sentances with So"
Crag says, "how strange."
stormagnet sortof wakes
stormagnet says, "Holy shit dude"
stormagnet says, "I was going to just check my scroll before showering, but daaaamn"
stormagnet scrolls way the hell back
stormagnet says, "Oh wait, there we go"
stormagnet says, "okay"
stormagnet says, "The point I was trying to make earlier is that I think your answers ARE pertinent to the diagnostic, even if the diagnostic is geared towards people who don't think as deeply about their answers."
stormagnet says, "NONE of those criteria would apply to everybody all the time"
stormagnet says, "But if they apply often enough that you're worried that you have a problem in the first place, then they apply as a point towards the diagnosis"
stormagnet says, "The Adderal page is not a good criteria to go by"
stormagnet says, "Their diagnostic checklist looks geared towards the ADHD kind, or whatever they're calling it now"
stormagnet says, "The hyper and aggressive kind, not the Primarily Inattentive whatsit"
stormagnet says, "So only that first chunk"
stormagnet says, "When I look at the Primarily Inattentive type criteria, I don;t see anything that DOESN'T apply"
stormagnet says, "Which is why I thought that medication sounded like a viable option"
stormagnet says, "It has NOTHING TO DO with CRAZY"
stormagnet says, "Though it does have a bit to do with DENIAL"
stormagnet says, "YOur prejudices against doctors and medication are pretty strong, so I worry that you'll reject options out-of-hand that might help you"
stormagnet says, "NOT that that is what you're doing right now"
stormagnet says, "Just that, with that kind of reluctance, it's harder to step back and have patience"
Crag says, "Hi!"
stormagnet says, ":hehs"
stormagnet says, "ck"
stormagnet says, "ACK, GODDAMMIT"
stormagnet needs a typo mallet
Crag nods and agrees with all your comments
Crag says, "I'm starting to feel better about the whole process now"
stormagnet cheers!!
Crag says, "I still dread calling Dr. Wood back, but that's a different problem having to do with me and phones."
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "Jenny said I seemed more cheerful this week"
stormagnet says, "I think that might be a thing that gets better too"
stormagnet says, "The phones things"
Crag says, "I sure hope so"
stormagnet says, "YAYS"
stormagnet says, "I could see how you'd get stressed trying to pay attention to a phone conversation, which is harder than paying attention in-person, because of all the social cues"
stormagnet says, "And would explain why we talk so well over the MOO and email instead :)"
Crag says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "That's why so many ADD types go the ubergeek route"
Crag says, "makes sense"
Crag says, "I still think my way is better, but I want to work with other people, so I want to get better at their ways of working too"
stormagnet says, "I think we should find you someone to work with who uses email with their clients"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "yeah, that would help a lot"
stormagnet says, "You want the OPTION"
Crag says, "I never asked Dr. Wood if she has email"
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet says, "The idea isn't to force you into anything, but to make it possible for YOU to force YOURSELF"
Crag says, "More options means more freedoms means more ways to consent means more informed consent"
stormagnet NODS!
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag says, "Text is way better for me"
Crag says, "It's silly"
stormagnet NO
stormagnet says, "It's not"
stormagnet says, "It makes tons of sense"
stormagnet says, "And I prefer text for the same reason"
Crag says, "I think the upsetness when we're talking techie in person may have more to do with the talking in person than the other stuff"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "The cues go wrong"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I may be glossing over, but I don't think I've ever gotten upset with someone online"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Not a friend"
Crag says, "Except some particularly poinient romance related email sessions"
stormagnet says, "Family, yes"
Crag says, "but yeah"
Crag says, "Oh yeah"
Crag says, "family..."
stormagnet says, "And techie compatriots, HELL yes"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
stormagnet says, "well"
stormagnet says, "Yes, but not often?"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "occasionally."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "AND"
Crag says, "Each time had extenuating circumstances"
Crag says, "Like Kia being a bitch"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "There's no format that wouldn't hurt in"
stormagnet NODS!
Crag says, "But there's no reason why I should have been upset while working on techie stuff with you in person"
Crag says, "My reactions were completely disproportionate"
Crag says, "And I don't think I've had THAT happen online"
stormagnet hugs
stormagnet says, "Nope"
Crag hugs too
Crag says, "I also don't think I was born like that"
stormagnet says, "It may even be really good for us to be spending more time apart physically, and together virtually"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "I think it can be traced to my childhood and isolation"
Crag says, "And I think I CAN get better enough to not need chemical assistance"
stormagnet says, "Your social-cue-parser is kind of ludgy"
stormagnet says, "kludgy"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "Because it was trained on faulty input"
stormagnet says, "And it's hard for you to form a new one on your own"
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet says, "Because the kind of attention it requires"
Crag sighs with relief
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "These are the things I'd been thinking all along"
Crag says, "I agree about the value of spending more time together virtually"
stormagnet says, "They WHY of it was what eluded me before"
Crag nods.
stormagnet s/they/the
Crag says, "I had lots of whys, but they all seemed like excuses to me"
Crag says, "ANd none of them led me to a solution"
stormagnet says, "That sounds really familiar"
Crag says, "As something you've been through too, you mean?"
stormagnet says, "One of the very common characteristics of ADD is the low self-esteem and self-recrimination"
Crag says, "I was talking with Bruce about that this week"
Crag says, "It's hard to say whether a symptom is ADD or depression because either one could cause the other"
Crag says, "As I told him:"
stormagnet says, "Because all the things ADD puts a handicap on are things that we value as sourcse of Personal Character"
Crag says, "Who wouldn't be depressed if they could never find anything, and kept forgetting important appointments and paperwork?"
stormagnet s/sourcse/sources
stormagnet says, "Precisely!"
Crag says, "Likewise, if one were terribly depressed, they wouldn't have energy to find things or deal with stuff"
stormagnet says, "The place where those two hinge is where I needed more data"
Crag says, "And as I'm typing this, I think I am in a better mood than I was last Wednesday before I took any Adderall"
stormagnet says, "chicken vs egg"
Crag says, "SO maybe this is working"
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "So no wonder I felt trapped"
Crag says, "I was/am"
stormagnet says, "From my standpoint, I could see a lot of improvements while you're on Adderall, but they were hard to point out, because it was more an absence-of-the-symptoms-that-you-had-never-really-noticed kind of thing"
Crag says, "My own feeling is that the depression came first, but I'm not sure how useful that assessment is"
Crag says, "yeah?"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "It's possible to have both"
Crag says, "It's terribly uncomfortable for me to disagree on reality with you, because I know you're much more likely to be right."
stormagnet says, "The question is, does the depression have a CAUSE, or is it just sort of THERE, against all (non-chemical) logic?"
Crag says, "s/uncomfortable/scary as hell/"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I know"
stormagnet says, "Which is why it's hard for me to pint to specific things, because they'll just hurt you"
Crag says, "I think the depression HAD a cause which has since gone away, but I'm still in the hole, years later"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "But if you're unhappy about one thing, that thing can swap with another"
stormagnet says, "Emotional redirection"
Crag says, "I think the cause was growing up isolated and surrounded by people who denied their own emotions and used them against each other."
Crag says, "I don't think I had any external reason to be depressed after 1996"
Crag says, "Even including my Seattle time"
Crag says, "I don't think I'm SAD either"
Crag says, "Because the lamp just doesn't do anything for me"
stormagnet says, "The real question is, are there times when you think, rationally, "I should be happy. There is nothing I can point to that would make me unhappy" (INCLUDING yourself)- and you still feel depressed"
Crag says, "I think it's purely association"
Crag says, "Ok, lemme think about that"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, the SAD didn't seem to make sense to me either"
stormagnet says, "Associations can be altered, but it's HARD"
Crag says, "I'd say I've found many things inside me to be unhappy about, but that they tie closely to the ADD symptoms we've previously discussed"
stormagnet says, "And it requires a lot of deliberate, internal focus"
stormagnet says, "The ability to be thinking something, notice yourself thinking it, and changing what you think"
Crag says, "Chet calls that stalking yourself"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Chet's so cool :)"
stormagnet says, "Okay, I REALLY need to shower"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "You'll probably get busy after that"
stormagnet says, "Otherwise I won't finish before it's time for my appointment"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So I guess I'll see you around 4?"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "Have a good shower!"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet will :)
