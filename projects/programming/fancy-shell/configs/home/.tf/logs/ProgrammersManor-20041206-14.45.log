The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.

You say, "HAH"
You say, "Welcome!"
A rather tall fellow, indeed.
He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 23 minutes.
You sit on the large maroon couch.
You say, "How goes development of the new BBS?"
devil says, " it goes apace"
devil says, "we've got some rude post writing methods and network communication."
devil says, "next up: DB for posts instead of flat file"
You say, "Excellent"
You say, "The email I exchanged with Shannon recently was encouraging.  It sounds like his mood has improved considerably."
You say, "Which pleases me."
You say, "How've you been?  How're Laws and Rachel?"
You say, "What's the haps?"
devil says, "things are good good.  R's nearly done with this semester's classes, which is good."
devil says, "she has been in this astro lab class that's been eating all of her time and making her kinda of crazy"
devil says, "but it's alsmost done."
Robert nods.
devil says, "L's doing alright.  Working, finally. "
devil says, "I'm back to working full time. learning java from a book for most of the time i'm at work. heh."
devil says, "Stuff like that"
devil says, "How's tricks with you and the house and stormy?"
You say, "Well, of course the elections were hard on us"
You say, "More so for her, but then on me by association"
You say, "I don't know if you heard already, but her friend Kia confessed her love for Raine on Raine's birthday in October, so now Kia and her husband Nathan are living with us. :)"
You say, "Work is getting better.  We had a good year, so they're loosening the purse strings a little."
You say, "I just got our backups majorly upgraded, which is going to improve my work life lots."
You say, "We're planning a road trip for March"
You say, "If it happens, we'll certainly be visiting you."
You say, "I think that's about it"
You say, "Oh yeah."
You say, "Kia's running a game with Raine, Nathan and me in it, and we're having a blast."
You say, "That's definitely everything."
devil says, "oh! that's fairly exciting.  I'd not heard that stuff with Kia. Interesting."
devil says, "Shannon's running a Call of Cthulhu game for us and some more peoples. It's been fun. Lots of madness and death."
You say, "Yay!"
You say, "I don't know anything about that."
You say, "The best thing I can tell you is that I routinely leave work around 4pm."
You say, "Ohhh, look at the time!"
Robert idles: Mama, mama I'm comin' home...
[Idling at 3:55 P.M. on Tue, Dec 7: Mama, mama I'm comin' home...]
Robert wakes.
devil waves
Minty has connected.
Robert waves
You say, "I'll be awake in a few minutes."
Minty says, "ok"
Minty says, "BRB, gotta go put some CD's away."
Minty says, "back"
Minty says, "Hello devil :)"
You say, "Ok, I'm back too"
Minty says, "Yay!"
You say, "BURRITO"
Minty says, "mmmmm"
You are already sitting on the large maroon couch.
You say, "So where were we"
You say, "OH yeah, you knew what you wanted and you just went for it"
You say, "ANd an inheritance helped."
Minty says, "Ohhh, yep"
You say, "I feel a little spoiled for thinking these things are difficult."
Minty says, "whyee?"
Minty says, "some things are difficult to get."
You say, "I mean the knowing what I want"
Minty says, "Ohhhh"
You say, "I still don't really know"
Minty nods.
You say, "I have some leads"
Minty says, "good :)"
You say, "Obviously the harem thing is a good start"
Minty grins.
Minty nods.
You say, "So I feel spoiled that I have all this opportunity and success and I don't know if I want it or not."
Minty says, "hrm"
You say, "And I have the gual to not be happy"
Minty frowns.
You say, "I've got food, shelter, love and recreation"
Minty nods.
You say, "What right do I have not to be satisfied?"
You say, "That's why I ask people these questions"
Minty says, "You should be."
You say, "I know."
You say, "I think so too"
Minty nods.
You say, "I'm not miserable like I used to be"
You say, "I'm very nearly content.  I think."
Minty says, "good then!"
You say, "Some days I'm quite pleased."
You say, "Others, not so much"
Minty says, "hrm"
Minty says, "complicated."
Minty says, "But everyone has days like that."
You say, "I suppose."
Minty nods.
You say, "Eating helps :)"
Minty says, "well, ya ;)"
You say, "I was pretty darn skinny before I met Raine"
You say, "Now I'm just about normal."
Minty eeks!
Minty yays!
You say, "This is a good burrito"
Minty says, "Coolies!"
You say, "Do you have any projects you're working on?"
Minty says, "Me?"
You say, "Yeah."
Minty says, "Nope."
You say, "Do you get bored?"
Minty says, "Sometimes."
You say, "What do you do to deal with boredome?"
You say, "horedom"
You say, "bordeom"
You say, "oh jeeze"
Minty says, "I usually make myself busy doing things, or I listen to music."
Minty says, "Like, I'll attack a project that I've put off."
Robert nods.
Minty . o O ( cleaning out a closet or something )
Minty ughs.
Robert grins.
You say, "Do you have any creative outlets?"
Minty says, "Then when I do that, I come across things that I haven't thought about in a long time."
Minty says, "Nah, I'm not real creative."
You say, "Hm"
Minty grins.
You see a player who is too experienced to have any excuse for not having a description.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 a MOOShaker                             a Goat
You say, ""
You say, "I have lots of pent up creative energy"
Minty says, "Ahhh"
You say, "But whenever I try to do anything with it I get tired"
Minty nods.
You say, "Or something interrupts me or whatever"
Minty nods.
You say, "Maybe that's some of my agitation."
Minty says, "Very possible."
devil says, "Hello Minty. "
Minty smiles.
devil says, "Hello Robot!"
Robert grins.
Minty laughs.
You [to Minty]: he calls me that in person too.
Minty giggles.
You say, "It sounds awesome when he says it."
devil grins
Minty says, "aww"
You say, "Like the terminator or something."
Minty laughs!
Minty says, "Cool!"
Robert levels massive destruction
devil says, "It all came about from when I was telling lawra that he and r were maybe coming to visit and she misread robert as robot and it stuck"
Minty giggles.
Robert monotones, "I COME IN PEACE."
Minty laughs!
You say, "That was a great visit"
You [to Minty]: We ended up staying an extra day because Devil and Laws were so fun and accomodating.
devil says, "Actually it was about the visit that didn't happen."
Minty says, "awww"
You say, "Oh"
You say, "Well that would have been a good one too :)"
devil says, "The motorcycle fisco of 200X"
You say, "It's all been so long ago"
devil says, "And Ratchet and Clank consumed you"
Minty blinks.
You say, "THat's true"
You say, "Which goes nicely with the Robot theme."
devil help commu
You say, "MOO needs a package system"
devil nods
You say, "So I can @apt-get install fancy-stuff"
devil says, "Shammom was talking about at least keeping code for stuff offline so ifwhen the moo gets wiped again it'll be easier to reimplement things. like murder"
You say, "yes"
You say, "I used to do that"
You say, "when I programmed MOO more"
You say, "Now I'm all scatter-brained"
You say, "And more talk than action"
You say, "murder was fun"
Minty gulps.
devil nods.
Robert grins atta Minty.
Minty giggles.
Minty /murder = not a good mix..
Robert laughs
Minty giggles.
You [to devil]: Nathan has a game system (don't we all) which I might try to implement in MOO
You say, "The advantage being that he lives with me"
You say, "So I can make him explain stuff to me or change his system if I need him to or whatever"
Minty says, "So what's this murder you mentioned?"
You [to Minty]: We had a thing in the last version of this MOO where people could stab each other
Minty eeks!
You say, "And sufficient stabbing caused them to be forcibly moved to a room called 'heaven'"
You say, "WHich had an exit to the entrance hall"
You say, "Then they'd have to walk back to join the party"
Minty says, "Ahhhh!"
You say, "And then I made it so people could 'duck' to avoid getting stabbed"
You say, "But if they ducked without getting stabbed they'd fall over."
Minty giggles.
You say, "and then there was a score system."
Minty says, "Coolies!"
You say, "So you could see who was the most 'stabby', 'nimble', or 'clumbsy'"
Minty nods.
Minty <- very clumsy.
Minty nods.
You say, "It was mostly a social system"
You say, "People would get stabbed for bad jokes"
You say, "or good jokes"
Minty says, "Ohh"
Minty grins.
You say, "And since one stab wouldn't always kill a person death was sometimes a surprise."
You say, "It led to some very funny conversations"
You say, "Especially when PG and Binder would go at it."
Minty laughs.
You say, "How do you do today? STAB STAB STAB"
devil whispers to you, "How do you direct conversation again"
You say, "I'm fine, thanks. STAB STAB STAB"
Minty says, "Yikes!"
You [to devil]: 'is whisper, `is directed speach
Robert | `devil 'is whisper, `is directed speach
You [to Minty]: it was funny
You say, "HAHAHAHA STAB"
Minty yays!
Robert grins.
Minty laughs!
You say, "Ok, I think my lunch is over now."
You say, "My burrito is gone, my 30 minutes are up."
Minty says, "soo, now back to work?!"
devil says, "ppor burrito!"
Minty laughs!
You say, "yep"
You say, "That burrito lived a full life."
You say, "It had no regrets."
devil says, "I must fetch my meatless corndogs from the microwave"
Minty says, "lol"
Minty says, "meatless?  what they made of besides corn?"
You [to Minty]: THanks for dropping by.  Feel free to stick around, of course.
Robert idles: work work work
[Idling at 12:30 P.M. on Wed, Dec 8: work work work]
Minty frowns.
Minty pats.
devil says, "Nrom brom mrom"
devil says, "these are way better than they have any right to be"
devil says, "soybased hotdog creation inside the cornmeal"
devil [to you]: AH HA! thanks
Minty ewws!
devil [to Minty]: but they're really really good
Minty yays!
Minty [to devil]: you vegitarian?
Minty . o O ( vegetarian? )
devil [to Minty]: Nope. I just don't trust meat that's been through a siv
Minty laughs.
Minty nods.
Minty [to devil]: I think they're sweepings off the floor of the butcher shop, myself.
Minty gags!
devil ndos
devil says, "Exactly. So, I tend to prefer fakemeat foodstuffs for things like hotdogs and sausages.  Not always, but a lot of the time."
Minty nods.
devil says, "Also there's a Trader Joe's right under work and they have the meatless corndogs and no meaty ones."
Minty says, "I'm thinking of picking up a calf to raise for our own use in the Spring again, along with chickens and maybe a hog or two.  Least that way, we know the meat isn't full of crap."
Minty says, "I don't think I could become completely vegetarian, although I eat very little meat."
Minty shrugs.
devil nods
devil says, "Mom cooked mostly vegetarian + fish when i was growing up.  I could probably do it again, but I don't really have any reason to"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "I generally stick with chicken/turkey/fish."
devil says, "I do try to get the high quality meats when I cook for myself though. Stuff without growth hormones and antibiotics"
Minty nods.
Minty says, "Which is why I prefer to raise our own meat."
Minty [to devil]: you ever try to buy beef right off a farm?
Minty [to devil]: like a half or quarter of beef?
devil [to Minty]: nope. a) i've no where to store that much meat and 2) It'd take me a year to go though that much
Minty [to devil]: ahhh.
devil [to Minty]: like how i switch from lettters to number?
devil grins
Minty laughs.
Minty says, "I get so annoyed coz in the stores around here, all you can buy is Angus meat, and we find the quality of it to be very poor, and it's expensive."
devil [to Minty]: Where is 'here'?
Minty says, "In Minnesota."
devil says, "Ah ha!"
devil says, "What part?"
Minty grins.
Minty says, "Northern."
devil says, "I lived in Minneapolis for 4 yrs befome moving to CA."
Minty says, "w00!  I'm about 200 miles North of Mpls./St. Paul."
devil says, "Nearly canadia!"
Minty nodsnodsnods.
devil says, "The girl i moved to Mpls with was from Fargo/Moorehead"
devil says, "We drove up to see her folks a couplefew times"
Minty says, "Ahh, that's East of us quite a ways."
Minty says, "I mean West, duh me."
devil says, "So, Duluthishly?"
Minty says, "Uh, Northwest of there."
devil nods
Minty says, "That's about 70-80 miles away."
devil nods
Minty says, "Ok, I need to go, coz I've got a few things to do before I start chores, and I have lag coz I'm emailing a file to someone."
Minty hugs, shags and stuff.
devil says, "Alright. Laters!"
Minty says, "Might be back later."
Minty says, "toodles!"
You hear a quiet popping sound; Minty has disconnected.
Minty has connected.
Minty pokes you guys.
devil looks around
devil waves
devil says, "Hi!"
Minty says, "Hiii!"
Minty just pokes Robert now.
devil pokes robot.
Minty giggles.
devil says, "he sure is sleepy"
Minty nodsnodsnods.
Minty [to you]: Geez, come back to life!  I'm here now!
Minty says, "He works too much."
Minty says, "Ok, I got some stuff to do before I have to go outside and do chores.. gonna idle here."
devil says, "every idle one of us."
Robert wakes
You say, "I do work too much"
You say, "And I get no recognition at work."
You say, "No respect!"
devil [to you]: po' bunny~
You say, "bunny robot?"
You say, "Like in Animal Crossing?"
devil says, "@addalias robot to robert to robert"
Alias "robot" added to Robert(#238).
Aliases for Robert(#238) are now {"Robert", "Crag", "robot"}
You say, "Done"
Robert | Aliases for Robert(#238) are now {"Robert", "Crag", "robot"}
devil says, "eee!"
devil [to you]: yay!
Robert laughs
You say, "Too bad I don't have Alan Parsons' I Robot to listen to at work."
Robert sings, "I don't care.... what you dooo....
Robert | I wouldn't want to be like you."
Robert sings, "Woaooooah"
devil laughs
You say, "I like that album a lot"
You say, "I was listenting to Pantera in mourning of Darrel's passing, but now I want to listen to something soft."
devil says, "I don't think I know much AP. And I don't have any Pantera. I'm not a very good metalhead"
You say, "worst. metalahead. ever."
Robert scream/sings, "YOU SEE US COMING AND YOU ALL TOGETHER RUN FOR COVER."
devil says, "I do have three slayer albums though."
You say, "That's two better than me"
You say, "I've been meaning to get more, but...meh"
You say, "I heard a song from their new album that I liked this week"
devil says, "reign in blood, south of heaven and ... something else"
You say, "I've got south of heaven"
You say, "reign in blood is on my wishlist."
devil says, "reign in blood is good too."
You say, "from a lacerated sky!"
You say, "I've heard the one song :)"
You say, "my amazon wishlist has gotten huge"
devil says, "seasons in the abyss. that's the other one, i think"
devil says, "mine finally has some books on it"
You say, "Is Seasons good?"
You say, "Roots by Sepultura has been on my wishlist since before I knew Raine."
You say, "Almost four years now."
You say, "I really should spoil myself better."
devil says, "you should. right now. "
devil says, "I can't really remember. I like the three I have all about the same."
You say, "Raine's brothers got me a Slayer album last Xmas that was horrible."
You say, "I think it might have been a 'worst-of' album."
devil says, "which one?"
You say, "I don't know"
devil says, "so i don't get it."
devil says, "heheh"
You say, "I only listened to it once"
You say, "I should memorize the title so I can warn others."
You say, "I'll look at Slayer's discography and see if anyone sound like it"
You say, "The three you have are the most popular."
You say, "I have no idea."
devil says, "hehehe."
devil says, "I think R has a slayer tribute album that has something like three versions of the song south of heaven"
devil says, "some of them are pretty ok"
You say, "slayer are a strange band"
You say, "South of Heaven has terrible production quality, and the songs are paper thing, but there's something about them that's very compelling."
devil says, "this, being a tribute album, is all other bands and stuff, but yeah. weirdos"
devil nods
devil says, "yes! exactly."
You say, "I want Slayer to work with another band"
You say, "Someone more mature"
You say, "Or maybe just with Dave Mustaine"
devil says, "like tool"
You say, "YES"
You say, "TOol would be ideal"
You say, "Damn, a Tool/Slayer project would be incredible."
devil says, "i'm not sure meynard would put up with them though"
You say, "Yeah"
You say, "And he seems to be the meat of Tool"
Robert heh
devil nods.
You say, "Well whatever"
You say, "THere's a lot of room for colaboration in metal"
devil says, "The rest of them are competent enough, but yeah. he's the thing that makes them special"
You say, "The whole metal genre needs more diversity and new blood"
You say, "I think that's why I like the metal/hip hop crossovers so much"
You say, "Too bad the Beastie Boys got old"
You say, "They could have headed up a new metal revolution :)"
devil says, "yeah. they're damn hippies now, just about."
Robert grins.
You say, "Or geeks"
devil says, "no more Slayer guitarist guest spots for them."
You say, "yeah"
devil says, "geekhippies?"
You say, "There's a lot of overlap, isn't there."
devil says, "there sure is!"
Minty says, "Whoa!  I didn't know I was gonna idle this long."
Minty has reconnected.
Minty says, "Geez, my power went out!"
Minty says, "K, gotta go."
Minty hugs, shags and stuff.
You hear a quiet popping sound; Minty has disconnected.
Robert laughs
devil squints
devil sits on the large maroon couch beside you.
You say, "WEEKEND"
