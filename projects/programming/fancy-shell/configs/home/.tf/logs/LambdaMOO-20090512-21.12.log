PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

NOTICE FOR JOURNALISTS AND RESEARCHERS:
  The citizens of LambdaMOO request that you ask for permission from all
direct participants before quoting any material collected here.

Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

For one day only, LambdaMOO will engage in a special endeavor to help the economy.  For every character you receive on your screen this first day of the month, we will donate ONE PENNY to a special bailout fund, which will assist those AIG executives who had to return their bonuses in recouping that money so they can continue to enjoy their accustomed standard of living.  Make sure you type a lot TODAY!

Subject:  todays outage

Server box got into a weird state today.  All checkpoints after 9am failed, so that's where we had to revert.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

I've now decreased $dump_interval from 4 hours to 20 minutes; which most likely wouldn't actually have helped today, but it may in the future result in earlier warning and less lossage.  I also just installed a minor batch of debian updates including a kernel patch (which may or may not have anything to do with what went wrong -- my money is on *not* at this point, but we'll see...).

hey, I've been claim jumping and I have about 15 things claimed so far. I tried to claim two more things, and they both issued the following tracebacks:
#68868:claim (this == #53333), line 13: Invalid indirection
.. called from #111168:claim unclaim claims v4 v5, line 1
(End of traceback)

I'm not sure where I should send these things so if this isn't the appropriate place, I apologize

So, what did you try to claim?  It looks like it doesn't do good arg checking, so if you mistyped the number and got an invalid object instead, you'd get that error.  I suppose it should be better...
