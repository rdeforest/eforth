There's a pair of handcuffs by the bed. They're surrounded by empty Chinese
food cartons, an empty bottle of wine, and two wine glasses. One of the
glasses has fallen over, leaving a red stain on the carpet which slowly
creeps towards the handcuffs.

The alarm clock went off an hour ago, but the room's inhabitants have shut
it off, preferring the warmth of their shared bed to the cold of the real
world.

The Hallway
You're standing in the hallway of what looks to be a run-down apartment building. The hall is illuminated by a small forty-watt bulb which threatens to end its young life at any minute. As you survey your surroundings, you see a cockroach scurry from your view and disappear in some crack in the stairwell. In front of you (to the north), a door has a small paper with the number Twelve written on it. Behind you (to the south), a door labelled Eleven stands closed. Steps, rickety but functional, lead back down as well. There is a ladder here, leading up into what appears to be the attic. You also know, though, that you can go out to the street. 
The apartment mailboxes are battered and recessed into the wall, but still lock. The OpalMOO Christmas/Holiday Tree stands before you. Its lights blink on and off annoyingly. Please feel free to create an ornament and hang it on the green, scented branches. You see a pleasant bit of mistletoe hanging on the wall. 
You see the OpalMOO Theme, the OpalMOO Rules, and a newspaper here.

Don't forget to take a look at the newspaper.  Type 'news' to see it.
@ho: I don't understand that.
