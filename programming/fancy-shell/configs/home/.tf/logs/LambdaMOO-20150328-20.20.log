to be careful who you associate with and what you say.

Storage room
Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.

You note that the 60 watt incandescent bulb implies that the owner either doesn't care about the environment, or hasn't changed anything since compact flourestent lights became affordable.

Long time no see all, got a question.... How hard do you think it would be to code/convert the server into java? thx - Sych

Just offhand, isn't there some sort of C++ port of the MOO server out there?

That might be easier to port to Java.  Then again, it's C++, so it might be an insane mess.

About as hard as writing a new server. A little harder in some ways since with a new server you'd be making up all the semantics, but if you wanted something that would run existing dbs it would need to be compatible. A little easier in some ways, since having the semantics already would skip a bunch of design work. A lot easier than it might have once been since you probably wouldn't need to do anything too heroic to get reasonable performance.

I suppose you could use a suitable compiler to compile the existing server into bytecodes for the JVM but I assume the purpose of your question was to see what it'd take to have a Java version of the server to hack on rather than just running on top of the JVM for some reason.

The most interesting related project I know of at the moment is https://github.com/verement/etamoo (though that's not Java). It's still incomplete but unlike the other projects I know if it introduces parallelism without changing the observed behavior for code which in theory would mean it can run existing dbs.

Mostly compatible-with-LambdaMOO server rewrites are interesting (to me, at least) if they permit the reuse of the database (which is in many ways is bigger and harder to recreate from scratch than the server) while (hopefully) also introducing some new capabilities that could not be introduced with more mundane extensions to the existing C server.

This is an attempt to code a working LambdaMOO replacement in Ruby. This could then be run in a Java process (via JRuby) if that's what people wanted to do, or plugged into a Ruby on Rails app, or whatever.

I'm starting with the parser, which will return an executable program. Many common language features are implemented, along with unit tests for them.

If anyone is interested in contributing, feel free to do so. I'll take pull requests on github.
