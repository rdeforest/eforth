stormagnet | lux0r223: it would be nicer if he had any clue how much i liked him.
stormagnet | evanbaumgardner@mac.com: have you hit him in the head with a frying pan and
stormagnet | told him "i only do this because i love you" and then pushed him down some
stormagnet | stairs?

You say, "Look at the rest of the house"

stormagnet <- Junk Aggregator
You say, "And how... :)"
You say, "Oh, you mean the BBS! :)"
stormagnet says, "Not necessarily :P"
Robert grins.
stormagnet says, "Kia just called me"
Robert nods.
stormagnet says, "She was apologizing for having overslept, and thus not being back from her errands yet."
stormagnet says, ""
Robert heh
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I was considerably perplexed by her feeling the need to apologize :P"
You say, "She's going through some difficulties"
You say, "She's very impatient for the four of us to fit together better."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Poor thing"
stormagnet says, "I think we're making a lot of progress, though."
You say, "I agree"
You say, "The only real problem is patience."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Not for me. I am as patient as the GRAVE!"
You say, "Yeah, I know :)"
stormagnet . o O ( That's the ticket... now if I can just keep that muscle from twitching... )
stormagnet says, "You know what I should do?"
You say, "Is this a test?"
Robert grins.
stormagnet says, "Yes"
You say, "Um..."
You say, "Nothing?"
You say, "I think you should do nothing for a month."
You say, "Did I win?"
stormagnet says, "This will be going on your PERMANENT RECORD!"
stormagnet says, "Yes!"
You say, "YAY"
stormagnet showers Robert with confetti
You say, "Wow, I feel clean."
You say, "papery, but clean"
stormagnet says, "Actually, I was going to propose getting an enormous bag a garbanzo beans and making my own hummus, since I eat so much of it :P"
You say, "That sounds like a good idea."
stormagnet says, "That's not paper!"
You say, "garbanzo is a great word"
Robert lol
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "garbanzo sounds like a Muppet!"
You say, "A long version of Gonzo"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet winces at a Junk post by Vy
Robert . o O [ ut oh ]
stormagnet says, "I seem to have gotten thinner skin over time, not thicker..."
You say, "probably from interacting with her"
You say, "so you can immagine her saying it in person"
You say, "which makes it worse"
Robert shudders
stormagnet says, "Probably because not actually seeing and interacting with her in this long has exempted her from 'friend-offriend-of-friend' protection."
stormagnet says, "And I know that there's no deeper reasoning or logic or cultural statement involved."

stormagnet | Subject: henry v
stormagnet |
stormagnet | personally, I found Henry V incredibly tedious.
You say, "What does she expect, when entertaining Royalty? :)"
stormagnet says, "YET SHE CLAIMS SHE LOVES SHAKESPERE."
stormagnet laughs!
You say, "oh, you know how full of crap she is"
You say, "She'll say whatever will get her attention"
You say, "good or bad"
You say, "gifted child, etc"
stormagnet says, "See, I can respect someone who just comes out and admits that it goes over their head, or they find it irrelevant, orr whatever."
stormagnet says, "But yeah. Jeebus."
You say, "I made plans to meet up with Dan Weatbrook next week, and he asked if you'd be coming. :)"
You say, "I had to tell him no because of your foot"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
Robert idles to pee :)
stormagnet sniffles
Robert back
You say, "the cold weather made my nipples sore"
stormagnet tries to stifle a giggle
You say, "He wrote me back to recommend the use of duct tape to help your foot heal :)"
stormagnet laughs
Robert . o O ( red green show )
The verb :@paste is nowhere to be found.
stormagnet says, "Crappity- now I need the bathroom!"
You say, "I've lots faith in astrology.com.  I don't think Kelli Fox is as involved as she used to be."
Robert laughs
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Kelli Fox is being ghostwritten- that's my hunch."
stormagnet idles: bathroom!
Robert nodsnods
You say, "I've been listening to the Dave Brubeck you bought.  It's good, but it's also clear why it's not as famous.  It's much harder to grok and less catchy."
stormagnet returns with cold nipples!
Robert laughs
Robert sucks on them to warm them up.
stormagnet blushes!
stormagnet says, "I can't wait to hear that Brubeck, then. I LIKE the idea of his doing something harder to grok."
You say, "Crap, I'm supposed to be filling the tape library."
stormagnet wavies
You say, "Well"
You say, "I'm not leaving you yet :)"
stormagnet says, ":cheers!"
stormagnet blinks
You say, "This other Brubeck seems to meander"
stormagnet . o O ( was that an echo? )
You say, "It's not as 'tight' as Take Five"
You say, "Er I mean Time Out"
stormagnet says, "hmmm... maybe not a good thing, then"
You say, "Yeah, it's odd"
stormagnet says, "I just like the idea of him taking on something more complex"
You say, "Yeah"
You say, "It's more mellow"
You say, "I think that's how he's losing me."
You say, "Some of it's lively, but it doesn't grab me."
You say, "I think you'll like it though"
You say, "It's kinda like Sesame Street instrumental music"
You say, "At least some is"
stormagnet LAUGHS
You say, "There's four CDs, so it's impossible to boil it all down like that"
stormagnet says, "Wow. Nothing like reading news posts and schadenfreud to make 18 months sound like too LONG."
Robert growls
You say, "Don't let those freaks get to you"
You say, "Junk is extremely biased."
You say, "And they're a bunch of wankers."
Robert tries in vain to stem the flow of hate.
stormagnet giggles
