stormagnet . o O ( thuoght? )
stormagnet . o O ( perhaps some southeast asian dialect spoken only on a tiny isolated archipelago? )
stormagnet says, "It's a long one, I warn you"
stormagnet says, "But worth it"
Crag says, "Yes..."
Crag says, "It is pretty funny..."
Crag says, "Through minutes of pure awesome, the smoke began to clear."
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "I'm not sure if this is really good or really bad."
Crag says, "I just got to the time machine."
stormagnet snickers
Crag: China: Ancient China
stormagnet says, "I'm laughing just remembering it"

Crag says, "Yes..."
Crag says, "yeah right!"
Crag says, "I'm sure whoever made this is very proud of themselves."
Crag says, "Wait, not presidents.  I meant volcanos."
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "wow, high tech CG"

stormagnet peers
stormagnet  http://erasing.org/i_ate_ipod_shuffle/

Crag says, "that would be pretty sweet"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Wow, Sancho is being pushy"

stormagnet says, "If someone doesn't post that in DAMN THAT'S HOT>, I will."
stormagnet proceeds to forget how to paste messages, resulting in logging herself out repeatedly.
stormagnet . o O (  in, out, in out... )
stormagnet . o O ( I'm a cat! )
That is not a valid command.
Crag lol
The Pasting Feature (#1020) is already one of your features.
Crag [to stormagnet]: @addfeature paste
Crag says, "I ported the pasting feature a couple weeks ago"
Crag says, "so you can @paste and stuff"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "That's a hell of a lot easier here than in Junk :P"
Crag says, "well, yeah"
Crag says, "You already know what I think of the BBS"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "That's why I feed you what I consider to be the good bits ^_^;;"
Crag grins.

stormagnet commences sitting up
stormagnet says, "sweet!"
stormagnet says, "I got all 50 done before he woke up to investigate"
Crag says, "That's pretty cute"
Crag says, "SO I'm talking with another manager about moving into his group.  It's a unix-dominated group, and they're mostly based out of NoHo, so there'd be a chance of relocation eventually."
Crag says, "I'm thinking of it as a fallback plan in case IBM doesn't work out."
Crag says, "It probably wouldn't be an immediate change in pay, but I think the opportunity for raises would be higher."
Crag says, "And I wouldn't have to rack servers, trace cables or reboot windows servers."
Crag says, "I'm having lunch with Elaine Pan tomorrow to talk about how she likes working in the group."
Crag says, "One of the group's projects is migrating their solaris environment to linux"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
stormagnet says, "Sounds like an awesome lead :)"
Crag says, "Could be"
Crag says, "A lot of people don't like this manager, but those people are grumpy people, so I'm hopeful that I can get along with him."
Crag says, "And it would be a lot of fun to work with Elaine.  She's a hoot."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "She was the super-energetic lady at that lunch I went to, right?"
Crag says, "Probably, yes"
Crag says, "I don't remember the lunch..."
Crag says, "What was the occasion?"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "YEs!"
Crag says, "I remember now."
Crag says, "That was she"
Crag says, "Er, that was her"
Crag says, "English is stupid"
Crag says, "I want the universal language"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll try to speak and write in e-prime from now on"
Crag says, "as a first step to linguistic manipulation"
Crag says, "In which case I should have said, "I believe you are remembering the same woman I am refering to.""
Crag [to stormagnet]: I have been informed, that it is totally. wide. open.
Crag says, "But open like what?"
stormagnet ponders
stormagnet says, "Like a sewer?"
stormagnet says, "Like a mind?"
stormagnet says, ""Like an invitation?"

stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "They wouldn't be able to see me until th 18th- even if I WANTED to go there"
stormagnet says, "The Women's Health Clinic could see me tomorrow at 9:30am"
stormagnet says, "Which is awesome""
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "They need a copy of my medical records from my last annual exam"
stormagnet says, "Which the Planned Parenthood won't release to them without a signed waiver from me"
stormagnet says, "I need access to a fax machine"
stormagnet says, "Grr"
stormagnet says, "Okay, that egg flash is fucking genius"
Crag says, "I'm glad you like the egg thing"
stormagnet says, "Oy"

Crag says, "Yeah :)"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "Any dinner requests?"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "nothing comes to mind"
stormagnet says, "In honor of your awful day, I could make a Real Dinner"
stormagnet says, "Like, baked chicken breasts and potatoes au gratin and salad"
Crag says, "That sounds pretty tasty"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "Wait"
Crag ...
stormagnet says, "I used up the milk"
Crag says, "aww"
stormagnet says, "So, I could make wild rice, or you could get milk on the way home or whatever"
stormagnet says, "Or cous-cous"

Crag says, "couscous!"
stormagnet grins
