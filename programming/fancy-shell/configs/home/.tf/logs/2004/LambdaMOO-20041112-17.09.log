PLEASE NOTE:
   LambdaMOO is a new kind of society, where thousands of people voluntarily
come together from all over the world.  What these people say or do may not
always be to your liking; as when visiting any international city, it is wise
to be careful who you associate with and what you say.
   The operators of LambdaMOO have provided the materials for the buildings of
this community, but are not responsible for what is said or done in them.  In
particular, you must assume responsibility if you permit minors or others to
access LambdaMOO through your facilities.  The statements and viewpoints
expressed here are not necessarily those of the wizards, Pavel Curtis,
or Roger Crew, and those parties disclaim any responsibility for them.

Boxes, crates, scraps of stuff, and a dead rat are strewn about this small room. The air and everything else are dusty. Cough, cough. A hammock has been strung between two walls, and a single 60 watt bulb casts a dim light about the place.
