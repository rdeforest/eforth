I once read an article which identified somewhere between nine and eleven
programming language features which are frequently identified as "object
oriented". I can't find the article now, so I'm writing this.

# Features

## Inheritance

## Operator Overloading?

Not sure whether to include this one or not.

## [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science))

### "Ad hoc"

Behavior changes according to types of parameters (especially message receiver).

### Subtyping

For type-strict languages. Anything expecting type T will (probably) also work
on children of T.

## Encapsulation

This is generally described as the combination of data and code, but this
description is insufficiently specific for my tastes.
