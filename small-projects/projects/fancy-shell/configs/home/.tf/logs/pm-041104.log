Total: 3 people, 1 of whom has been active recently.
colin says, "Hi"
You say, "hi!"
You say, "You're awake :)"
colin says, "Yeah, I went to bed with the radio on and there was a programme about your election."
colin says, "Couldn't sleep :)"
Robert grumbles.
You say, "yeah"
You say, "It's been a rough week"
colin says, "Who'd have thought people could vote for him again."
You say, "No matter how I look at it I get depressed"
Minty says, "Bush sux... just sayin'.."
You say, "Either that many people are that stupid/misinformed/whatever, or it's fraud"
colin says, "What makes me angry is that 80% of the people who voted for him did so because of his morality."
colin says, "'morality'"
You say, "yeah, that too"
colin says, "Fraud, mmm.  Nice if it were."
You say, "I dunno"
colin says, "People never seem to fail to disappoint me, no matter how cynical I get they can always surprise me."
You say, "heh"
You say, "It's even getting to me"
colin says, "I was thinking ... you could claim asylum :)"
You say, "So what happened to XaoMOO?"
You say, "Could I?"
You say, "How would I go about that?"
colin says, "Well, your government can imprison you without trial, torture you, etc."
Robert pounds on the church door, screaming, "Sanctuary!  Sanctuary!"
You say, "Yes, that's true..."
colin says, "If you had a real fear of that you could apply for political asylum."
You say, "Hm"
You say, "I wonder if I could demonstrate a real fear..."
colin says, "If a lot of people did it, it could be interesting."
You say, "Except for being registered Libertarian, I don't think I'm high on Their List"
You say, "My wife's parents are Communists, though"
colin says, "The moment you made it public that you were aplying for political asylum and publicising it, you'd be justified in being afraid."
You say, "It's worth investigating, to be sure."
Robert laughs
You say, "That's true :)"
colin says, "Xao - bild moved premises and was then overcome with a vast wave of slack."
Robert heh
You say, "I kinda thought that might be the case"
colin says, "How've you been?  Still at Disney?"
You say, "People are welcome to congregate here as long as I have net"
You say, "Yeah, I'm still at Disney"
You say, "I've been investigating transfer to one of our international offices"
colin says, "Sweet.  Linuxified it all yet?"
You say, "We're about 20% linux in Seattle"
colin says, "Could be worse."
You say, "Which is awesome considering our division used to be a Paul Allen company"
colin says, "'specially so near to redmond."
You say, "Yeah"
You say, "Exactly"
You say, "The only thing slowing us down is training our engineers"
colin says, "Fucking Chinese fell through in a big and bitter and nasty way."
You say, "The PHBs love Linux 'cause it's 'free as in beer'"
You say, "Damn"
colin says, "I knew we were in trouble when our man there asked for the address of the linux community."
You say, "ouch"
You say, "Where does that leave you?"
colin says, "Where it finally touched cloth - they hatched a mad scheme to implement a system with both windows and linux syscalls."
Robert peuks
colin says, "I still have it, will eventually release it and people can have a good old laugh at it."
colin says, "Well, we're pootling along with the chinese agribusiness."
You say, "ahh ok"
colin says, "We have a publically listed company about to go."
You say, "Sweet"
colin says, "And it ought to be worth a bit.  Of course I'll have a tiny shareholding in it."
You say, "Still"
colin says, "Yeah, better than a poke in the eye."
You say, "So I officially married Raine a few months ago..."
colin says, "Congrats!"
You say, "Thank you"
colin says, "I don't quite know how to put this ..."
You say, "We've always been married in our heads, but this way we can use it as international leverage: "my wife needs me!""
Robert heh
colin says, "Wife and child?"
You say, "No no!"
You say, "No children even on the horizon"
You say, "However"
You say, "We also have a mistress"
You say, "Two actually"
You say, "But one is serious."
colin says, "Oh, ok.  Where I come from the usual form of a proposal is 'YOU'RE WHAT????'"
Robert laughs
colin says, "A mistress?"
You say, "Our marriage was for legal purposes"
You say, "yes"
You say, "We're polyamourous"
colin says, "Wow!"
You say, "But there's a point to all this"
colin says, "Your mistress isn't called umm Eva?"
You say, "Our main mistress is a native Austrailian who speaks fluent Manderin"
colin says, "oh, cool :)"
You say, "No, her name is Yevdokia"
colin says, "Where's she from?"
You say, "She's half Russian"
You say, "She's from Townsville"
You say, "Moved to the US when she was 5"
colin says, "Gets around!"
You say, "But her stepdad has a house in Townsville"
You say, "yeah :)"
You say, "She rocks"
colin says, "Wild life."
You say, "It gets wilder... :)"
colin says, "Townsville is all sugar cane and ummm naval bases."
You say, "Hm"
colin says, "Or something, is it an aluminium transshipment place?  There's a big port around there."
colin says, "I have rellos in Townsville."
You say, "I don't know yet"
You say, "I have lots of research to do still"
You say, "Oh, I have a house now"
colin says, "My second cousing came from there."
colin says, "You own it?"
You say, "Two mortgages, but yeah"
colin grins.
You say, "And Kia's stepdad is a property manager and would be willing to manage my house for me while we're gone."
You say, "So we've got that covered, more or less"
You say, "ANd he'd rent his place in Townsville to us"
You say, "SO"
colin says, "So you can get out.  I should mention - we elected a right wing cunt too.  Not as bad, though."
Robert heh
You say, "How could yours be worse than ours? :)"
colin says, "Bloody hell, what would you do in Townsville?"
You say, "That I don't know."
colin thinking... you're right.
Robert grins.
colin says, "Well there's bugger all there, in technology."
colin says, "Nothing for 1000km in any direction."
You say, "Kia thinks Ian (her stepdad) can get me a job.  I'm having lunch with them tomorrow"
You say, "damn"
You say, "That could be a damper"
colin says, "It's the sticks, man."
You say, "The other problem is Oz's immigration laws seem to be prohibitive"
You say, "I got 115 points on a scale I need 120 points on"
colin says, "I mean: Sydney's the sticks compared to Seattle, Brisbane is the sticks compared to Sydney, and Townsville ..."
You say, "Ah"
colin says, "What're the point?"
colin says, "points?"
You say, "It's how to figure out if I can get a work permit or something"
You say, "Ranie was showing it to me last night"
You say, "raine"
You say, "I didn't get the full scoop from her"
colin says, "Yeah, but ... surely you can fudge 5/120"
You say, "Maybe"
You say, "If I can scrape up a relative or something"
You say, "Or fake one"
You say, "I duno"
colin says, "Ahh, a long lost child :)"
Robert laughs
colin says, "You'd have to look at it carefully.  You're white, that probably counts for about 20pts."
You say, "Hm..."
You say, "I'll get more details from Raine tonight."
You say, "Last night I didn't have the energy to deal with it"
colin says, "In the old days, when I was a kid, they had the white australia policy."
You say, "I just wanted to forget everything"
You say, "wow"
You say, "I had no idea"
colin says, "Yeah, you couldn't come here if you weren't white."
colin says, "And the way they enforced it was really devilishly cunning:  the law said you had to demonstrate proficiency in a European language."
colin says, "But it didn't say *which* European language."
Robert nods solemnly.
You say, "bastards"
colin says, "So it was up to the discretion of the immigration official.  He didn't like the look of you, you got tested in Bulgarian."
colin says, "Unless you were Bulgarian, of course."
You say, "of course"
You say, "No matter where we go I'll have a lot of studying to do"
colin says, "I've never been to Townsville.  FAR too far north.  I've never been half way to Townsville."
You say, "How far is it from Sydney?"
Robert digs up a map...
You say, "looks like 2000mi on this very large map"
You say, "or 1500"
You say, "hm"
colin says, "Yep.  A looong way"
You say, "Farther than LA is from Seattle"
colin says, "Good news, it's a university town.  James Cook University."
You say, "So if I went to Townsville I wouldn't be visiting you much :)"
You say, "Oh, that helps"
You say, "It also shows up on my map of Oz, so it can't be TOO small..."
colin says, "http://www.jcu.edu.au/"
colin says, "It's more that there's not much else up there to put on the map."
Robert laughs
You say, "JCU has a page in Wikipedia"
colin says, "They do a lot of marine stuff."
colin says, "On the reef as they are."
You say, "I wonder if JCU needs a sysadmin... :)"
colin says, "Yeah, maybe."
Robert clicking on "Jobs at JCU"
colin says, "It's not a hopeless cause as I thought."
Robert | Job Title: HEAD, JCU OYSTER COURT APARTMENTS
You say, "I'm there."
You say, "Maybe Ian will know someone there."
You say, "Since he still has property there I'm sure he must have some decent contacts there."
You say, "He'll be a good resource."
colin | http://www.jcu.edu.au/app/jobs/positiondetails.cfm?reference=4252
You say, "Yes"
You say, "That's totally me"
You say, "Closing date: tomorrow."
You say, "I need to apply tonight."
colin sighs.
Robert heh
You say, "Hah, they want Novell experience!"
You say, "I have that!"
colin says, "Woo!"
You say, "A year at Coast Commercial Bank, Novell 3.11"
colin says, "Well, bung yer cv in the email and see how it goes."
You say, "Totally"
You say, "I'm not going to be getting much Disney work done today.  Heh."
colin says, "You can lodge it electronically, I see - they have a link."
You say, "Yeah, I saw that too"
You say, "I wonder if they'll be sympathetic to my cause"
colin says, "Hmmm.  Well, they are academic types, so that's possible."
colin says, "OTOH, they are from the deep north, so it's possible not, too."
Robert nods.
colin says, "play it safe."
colin says, "This is the tropics, btw."
You say, "Don't mention it at first, drop a hint if things look bleak."
colin says, "Yeah."
You say, "Yeah, Kia mentioned that."
You say, "She says the light is bright white and it gets hot."
colin says, "Yeah.  Cane toads and mosquitos."
colin says, "Hot and *humid*"
You say, "And other nasty stuff too"
You say, "She tells stories about toads, leeches, snakes."
colin says, "she tell you about box jellyfish?"
You say, "No, she didn't mention those."
You say, "What are they?"
colin smirks, stand by.
colin says, "You'll think I'm pulling your leg."
colin |http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_1box.htm?tqskip1=1
Robert!
colin says, "Then there are stonefish, cone shells and crocs too I think."
You say, "scary stuff!"
colin says, "They have bottles of vinegar on poles on the beach.  Apparently you can avoid the stings if you're willing to swim in pantyhose."
colin says, "This is not like drop bears, this is fair dinkum."
You say, "Drop bears?"
colin says, "A particularly vicious kind of meat eating koala, they hang around in trees and drop on unsuspecting tourists - devouring them."
colin says, "Only tourists, curiously."
colin says, "That is a leg-pull."
colin | http://grimwade.biochem.unimelb.edu.au/cone/index1.html
colin says, "That's about cone shells - poisonous sea molluscs."
You say, "Wow"
colin | http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/stonefish.htm
colin says, "That's stonefish, poisonous fish."
colin says, "These are just the ones capable of causing fatality."
You say, "Right"
You say, "I'll have to stay inside on the computer all day :)"
colin } http://www.dal.ca/~ceph/TCP/bluering1.html
colin says, "Blue ringed octopus - also deadly."
colin says, "And then there are various sea snakes."
You say, "Sheesh"
You say, "You guys have a lot of population control"
colin says, "Oh yeah."
colin says, "And it's all tiny."
You say, "Does any of this help cut down on idiots?"
colin says, "Ah, well ... I do have one amusing newspaper clipping."
colin says, "A bloke was driving drunk in the NT, and saw a puff adder or something, and wanted it as a pet."
colin says, "So he dropped it in a sack and stuck it in the back seat.   Then reached for a beer."
colin says, "It bit him a couple or ten times."
colin says, "However he didn't die, just lost his arm."
You say, "yeesh"
colin says, "His mate tried to put him out of his pain by bashing him with a full beer can.  Most unintentionally amusing story."
Robert laughs
colin says, "I don't think you go ocean swimming in Townsville, is the thing."
You say, "Kia jokingly said that the Oz national anthem goes, "More beer, more beer.  More beer, more beer...""
colin says, "Yeah, beer.  Pronounced: Bih"
You say, "I've never really been keen on swimming anyway"
You say, "Yup"
You say, "She even pronounced it that way"
colin says, "Yeah, but it's not stinking hot where you come from."
colin says, "I'm sure they've got plenty of swimming pools and such."
You say, "not so much"
colin says, "And Ice.  Ice == civilization!!"
You say, "Swimming pools are much more common in California"
colin meant in Townsville.
You say, "Oh right"
You say, "I mis-read"
You say, "I read they've as you've"
colin says, "I imagine that Olympic Peninsula is lovely."
You say, "It's not really to my taste"
You say, "It's very green"
colin says, "No?  Too much fog?"
colin says, "Oh.  Green.  Heh."
You say, "Just... not my thing"
You say, "It's pretty some days"
colin says, "You're from the midwest?"
You say, "No, I'm from here, actually"
You say, "I grew up in Oregon"
You say, "But I ran away at 15 to live with my sister in California"
colin says, "Oh, righto.  Didn't know that."
You say, "That's my favorite place so far."
colin says, "PatGently's from Oregon and living in Seattle too."
You say, "Raine loves it here."
colin says, "Not portland ... hmm ... where exactly."
colin says, "eugene"
You say, "That's a little south of my home town"
You say, "Well, a little meaning an hour or so"
You say, "maybe two"
colin says, "One thing that might not be immediately apparent to you while looking at a map ..."
colin says, "You see a map, you see Townsville and Cairns and Brisbane.  And you might imagine it's got people between those points.  It hasn't."
You say, "Hm"
colin says, "You may well have to drive 6 hours to get from one smallish city to the next."
You say, "Is it baren?"
colin says, "No, I don't imagine it's barren.  Riotous, tropical.  Just mostly empty."
You say, "Hm"
colin says, "Just that I know the US is pretty evenly and relatively densely populated."
colin says, "Oz isn't as populated."
You say, "Yeah"
colin says, "So a hospital might serve hundreds of square miles."
You say, "I wish I were in a position to visit a bunch of places before picking up stakes"
colin says, "It's a massive change."
colin says, "One person I know migrated to Oz from Virginia.  Her comment was about how shit the consumer goods are."
colin says, "The food's good, and plentiful and cheap."
colin says, "But you will find the clothing and footwear outrageous"
Robert grins.
colin says, "poor quality, high price."
colin says, "You'd be moving to the very edge of the empire."
You say, "That is sortof the point."
colin says, "I would suggest you consider New Zealand, btw."
You say, "Yeah?"
colin says, "Well, temperate zone, smaller place, no deadly animals, people are nice (except perhaps the maori), government is broadly left, female PM, fairly nationalistic."
You say, "Hm"
colin says, "not dry, a couple of biggish cities, pleasant, *nice* scenery"
colin says, "volcanos."
colin says, "umm ..."
You say, "Do you know if they need techies?"
colin says, "I guess so."
Robert nods.
colin says, "Aukland is kinda the equivalent of Sydney, I think."
colin says, "Smaller, about 1M people I guess."
colin says, "Remember Peach?  He grew up there."
You say, "Not very well"
colin says, "When Howard won here, I SMS'd SAU K telling her we're moving to NZ."
You say, "Heh"
colin says, "Exports: crowded house, sam neil."
You say, "I've heard of Crowded House"
colin says, "No, really?"
colin grins
You say, "heh"
colin says, "The NZers I've met have always struck me as pretty laid back."
colin says, "They really resent Australians."
You say, "For not being laid back?"
You say, "or what"
colin says, "For interfering with them all the time."
colin says, "Acting as US stooges."
You say, "Oh"

You say, "CREEPY"
colin says, "SAU K's been to aukland on business.  She says it's lovely."
colin says, "It's built on a volcano."
You say, "The pictures are certainly nice"
colin says, "Sydney's lovely too."
colin says, "Overdeveloped, though, and way too expensive, and overcrowded."
You say, "But lovely :)"
colin says, "Well, it has one of the best natural harbours anywhere."
colin says, "But it's not like you get much amenity from it, if you're not fantastically rich"
You say, "I will be about as poor as I've ever been after this move, no matter where I go."
colin says, "Honestly?  I think you would be better off not making a gesture."
You say, "I know"
colin says, "Keep your head down, it's only 4 years."
colin says, "Or 8 :)"
You say, "It's entirely Raine's thing"
You say, "heh"
colin says, "Right, she's dead set on moving, huh?"
You say, "She thinks Bush will take over completely"
colin says, "There's a chance, for sure."
You say, "She thinks we're pre-WWII Germany"
colin says, "Yes, it's quite possible.  A lot of stuff is similar."
You say, "She thinks we need to get out while we still can"
You say, "Yeah, I can't really argue with her"
You say, "I've tried :)"
colin nods.  She might be right.
You say, "She might."
colin says, "Stay near Canada."
You say, "Which is even more depressing in a way"
You say, "One of our plans is to hide in Vancouver to see if he shows his true colors and what shakes down from that."
You say, "Which would be much more practical"
You say, "Australia's on the list of targets because it sounds cool, you're there, and Kia's stepdad can help us."
You say, "Hungary's on the list because I might be able to get a transfer within Disney."
colin says, "It is on some target lists, yeah."
You say, "heh"
colin says, "EU would be safer, probably."
You say, "That's probably true."
colin says, "And more economically and culturally rewarding"
colin says, "Understand, I'm not trying to dissuade you, I'm trying to paint the worst case."
You say, "Yeah, I understand"
You say, "The primary deciding factor will be personal economics"
You say, "getting a job"
colin says, "Townsville is a definite dead end."
You say, "I've already told her I'm not going anywhere without accepting a job offer first."
You say, "Hm"
You say, "The only advantage to Townsville is Kia and Ian's contats."
colin says, "Oh, shit man, it's a long long way from anywhere.  It's less than 1M population.  There aren't many jobs at all, let alone specialised skilled jobs."
You say, "It all seems so hopeless though"
You say, "bleah"
colin says, "Its advantages are tropical climate."
colin says, "If there was a conventional war, though, it'd be swarming with yanks."
You say, "According to wikipedia the pop of Townsville is 155.5k"
colin says, "Right, a town."
Robert nods.
You say, "It's about three times as big as Santa Cruz."
colin says, "And you're a *long* way from anything resembling a city."
You say, "That could be depressing."
colin says, "Yebbut ... how far is SC from LA or SF?"
colin says, "An hour's drive in traffic?"
You say, "an hour to SF, four hours to LA"
You say, "And less than that to San Jose."
You say, "so yeah"
colin says, "You're looking at 6 hours to *anywhere* with nothing in between."
You say, "I'm getting the isolation thing :)"
You say, "6 hours of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome driving :)"
colin says, "And in this case, the 'anywhere' is Brisbane, which is about as close to nowhere as you can get."
colin says, "Nah, not dry.  Tropical."
You say, "Oh right"
You say, "hm"
colin says, "It's possibly almost as wet as Oregon, in the wet season.  They only have two seasons."
colin says, "Actually, possibly wetter."
You say, "Yeah"
You say, "most of Oregon is dry, actually.  It's only the coast and Willamet valley that are wet"
colin says, "Check out what else is at that latitude, to get an idea."
colin says, "Sydney is at the same latitude as SC."
colin says, "Well, Seattle then."
You say, "yeah"
You say, "ugh"
Robert heh
You say, "I really need to visit."
colin says, "155K, huh.  Fuck me, the suburb I grew up in was bigger than that."
You say, "I'm a small-town guy"
You say, "My home town was 15k when I left"
colin says, "To go to HS?"
You say, "And it was an hour to Portland, which was around 200k at the time"
You say, "To move to CA"
You say, "I was home-schooling at the time"
colin's always lived in a city.
You say, "Did two years of high-school while living with my sister."
You say, "My sister lived 4 miles from a town of 4000"
colin says, "This city, come to think of it."
You say, "heh"
colin says, "Ok, it's 5:18 am.  I'm going to try to sleep."

You say, "I talked to Raine some more last night and she agreed to wait 'till we can re-finance the house, or possibly sell it, which won't be until May '06."

You say, "and maybe she'll change her mind again before then."

You say, "Looks like my information is old"
You say, "So you're fine"
Minty says, "Whew!"
You say, "It used to be that satellite was broadcast only, and your upstream link was via dialup"
Minty nods.
You say, "And the downstream link was very high latency"
You say, "So you'd get fast downloads, but browsing and MOO would suck"
You say, "But apparently they fixed that."
Minty says, "God, I hope everything will be fine by the time we get it."
You say, "My information is 9 years old, don't mind me"

Minty says, "We're gonna be getting it through our electric company, coz it's gonna be cheaper than through Direct Ineternet.. modem will be at least half the price of Direct."

Robert | 12. Is satellite Internet access faster than DSL ?
Robert |
Robert |
Robert | Not necessarily. Satellite broadband is used mostly in places where DSL isn.t available, thereby giving people who live in rural areas a broadband solution.
Robert |
Robert | Different satellite providers commit different speeds and offer different packages. In general, satellite has the disadvantage of high latency, hindering its performance in any real-time online activities such as gaming and voice/video over IP. If latency is an important factor, DSL broadband has a definite advantage, if throughput is the determining factor, satellite may have an advantage in some cases (not considering download quotas, or the DirectWay "fair Access Policy").
You say, "Note the 'high latency' part"
You say, "That means MOOing may be laggy for you"
Minty says, "Yeah"
You say, "But it might still be better than dialup"
Minty says, "Anything would be better than dialup.. at least I wouldn't have slow downloading, the constant disconnecting I get on windy days, etc."
Robert nods.
Minty says, "But still, the thoughts of it being icky for MOOing, would suck."
You say, "How far are you from civilization? :)"
Minty says, "Hmm.. about 15 miles."
You say, "that's not too bad"
You say, "You'll probably get serious net in a few years"
Minty says, "The internet service I use (uslink) is based in Pequot Lakes, which is really far away from me, and it serves parts of three States."
You say, "The main problem is just that low population density areas aren't worth the investment for internet providers to make connections to."
Minty says, "DSL and cable are out of the question for us."
You say, "Yep"
Minty says, "Basically, it's up in the air still."
You say, "It's just not cost effective to run high-speed lines out to a handful of families."
You say, "But the costs are coming down"
Minty says, "yeah"
You say, "Eventually fiber will be cheap enough to use for everything"
Minty says, "I booked marked that URL you gave me, gonna have hubby read it later."

Minty says, "I don't think I got to know any of them."
You say, "They've all been a circle of friends from long before I ever knew them."

ADMIN
=====

There are three separate (but not necessarily disjoint) groups of administrators, with different roles and responsibilities.  You can get help about each of the following groups, listed here with a brief explanation of what it is they're responsible for.

steering-committee[1]
      defining and maintaining the MOO's goals and objectives
tech-group[2]
      technical development and maintenance of the MOO
community-group[3]
      handling social problems and promoting a sense of community

By defining the responsibilities of the various types of administrators, we hope to clear up any confusion about what a person `in charge' is supposed to be doing, and what authority that person has.

FEATURES
========

Features are objects that provide you with commands not covered by the ordinary player objects.  The advantage of using features is that you can mix and match the things you like; whereas if you like a command that's defined on a player class, you have to also get all the commands it defines, and all the commands its ancestors define.

You can list your features (see `help @features'[1]), and add or remove features from your list (`help @add-feature'[2] and `help @remove-feature'[3]).


Note to programmers: In order to be available for general use as a feature, an object must have a verb or property named "feature_ok" which returns a true value.

When a feature is added to a player's features list, feature:feature_add is called, if it exists, with the player in question as its argument.  Likewise, when a feature is removed, feature:feature_remove is called.

Property #246.feature_ok already exists.

$STRING_UTILS:PARSE_COMMAND
===========================

:parse_command(cmd_line[,who])

 => {verb, {dobj, dobjstr}, {prep, prepstr}, {iobj, iobjstr}, {args, argstr},

     dobjset, prepset, iobjset}

This mimics the action of the builtin parser, returning what the values of the builtin variables `verb', `dobj', `dobjstr', `prepstr', `iobj', `iobjstr', `args', and `argstr' would be if `who' had typed `cmd_line'.  

`prep' is the shortened version of the preposition found.



`dobjset' and `iobjset' are subsets of {"any","none"} and are used to determine possible matching verbs, i.e., the matching verb must either be on `dobj' and have verb_args[1]=="this" or else it has verb_args[1] in `dobjset'; likewise for `iobjset' and verb_args[3]; similarly we must have verb_args[2] in `prepset'.

-----
$STRING_UTILS:PARSE
===================

That object does not define that verb.

-----
$STRING_UTILS:WORDS
===================

This breaks up the argument string into words, the resulting list being obtained exactly the way the command line parser obtains `args' from `argstr'.

-----
ME:TELL
=======

(No documentation.)

-----
ME:NOTIFY
=========

now properly understands extra args, even if it ignores them, and returns 1 on success like notify() does in 1.8.0

6/13/96: extra args are now passed through in the case where linewrap and pagination are turned off. --Rog

11/18/97: fixed OOB quoting --Rog

-----
STRING_HASH()
=============

Syntax:  string_hash (str <text>)       => str
         binary_hash (str <bin-string>) => str

Returns a 32-character hexadecimal string encoding the result of applying the MD5 cryptographically secure hash function to the contents of the string <text> or the binary string <bin-string>.  MD5, like other such functions, has the property that, if
    string_hash(<x>) == string_hash(<y>)
then, almost certainly,
    equal(<x>, <y>)
This can be useful, for example, in certain networking applications: after sending a large piece of text across a connection, also send the result of applying `string_hash()' to the text; if the destination site also applies `string_hash()' to the text and gets the same result, you can be quite confident that the large text has arrived unchanged.

`HELP MATCH' AMBIGUOUS
======================

Sorry, the topic `match' is ambiguous.  I don't know which of the following topics you mean:

`help #1:match'[1]      `help match()'[2]

MATCH()
=======

Syntax:  match (str <subject>, str <pattern> [, <case-matters>])   => list
        rmatch (str <subject>, str <pattern> [, <case-matters>])   => list

The function `match()' (`rmatch()') searches for the first (last) occurrence of the regular expression <pattern> in the string <subject>.  If <pattern> is syntactically malformed, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  The process of matching can in some cases consume a great deal of memory in the server; should this memory consumption become excessive, then the matching process is aborted and `E_QUOTA' is raised.

If no match is found, the empty list is returned; otherwise, these functions return a list containing information about the match (see below).  By default, the search ignores upper-/lower-case distinctions.  If <case-matters> is provided and true, then case is treated as significant in all comparisons.

The list that `match()' (`rmatch()') returns contains the details about the match made.  The list is in the form:

    {<start>, <end>, <replacements>, <subject>}

where <start> is the index in <subject> of the beginning of the match, <end> is the index of the end of the match, <replacements> is a list described below, and <subject> is the same string that was given as the first argument to the `match()' or `rmatch()'.

The <replacements> list is always nine items long, each item itself being a list of two integers, the start and end indices in <string> matched by some parenthesized sub-pattern of <pattern>.  The first item in <replacements> carries the indices for the first parenthesized sub-pattern, the second item carries those for the second sub-pattern, and so on.  If there are fewer than nine parenthesized sub-patterns in <pattern>, or if some sub-pattern was not used in the match, then the corresponding item in <replacements> is the list {0, -1}.  See the discussion of `%)' in `help regular-expressions'[1], for more information on parenthesized sub-patterns.

    match("foo", "^f*o$")        =>  {}
    match("foo", "^fo*$")        =>  {1, 3, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foo"}
    match("foobar", "o*b")       =>  {2, 4, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}
    rmatch("foobar", "o*b")      =>  {4, 4, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}
    match("foobar", "f%(o*%)b")
            =>  {1, 4, {{2, 3}, {0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}

See `help regular-expressions'[2] for information on the syntax and semantics of patterns.

Minty [to you]: Ok, just came to tell you we're pretty sure we'll be getting satellite internet sometime between January and April of next year.  If you wanna check it out, go to www.wildblue.com and maybe let me know what you think.  It sounds good to me, but.. what do I know, eh?
Minty winks.
