Subject: Re: tangent re: icmp blocking

No, not manually, but do script kiddies have scripts that scan a subnet for hosts using ICMP, then concentrate on attacking the hosts they find exist?  I'm not sure what the state of the art is in scripts here...  Might also be a DDOS type of opening...

But Point taken.  ICMP is a part of the internet, and not all ICMP is bad.

To:      *Site-Issues (#72243)
Subject: Re: tangent re: icmp blocking

Script kiddies don't bother checking to see if the host is pingable.  Why bother checking when it's so easy to block ICMP anyway?  Just because you can't ping the host doesn't mean you can't exploit it.  An attacking client will spray SYNs at hundreds of potentially vulnerable IPs, and then follow with those from which they get a reply.  Sending an ICMP packet and waiting for a reply would just unnecessarily complicate and slow down an attacking script.
