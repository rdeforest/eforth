The Reading Room in the Library
This is a portion of the vast library bounded on three sides by bookcases and on the fourth by a wall hosting a large fireplace.  A coat of arms gleams over the fireplace.  As in all of the library, the floor is plushly carpeted in brick red.  There are gaps between the bookcases leading to other parts of the library.  A large maroon couch is here.  A low table is here.  A bookcase is part of the wall.
enceladus is here, off in another world.

You say, "Welcome"
You sit on the large maroon couch.
You see a player who should type '@describe me as ...'.
E is awake, but has been staring off into space for an hour.
You say, "I'm going to be bringing up a different database tomorrow, and I'll give everyone prog bits after that."
