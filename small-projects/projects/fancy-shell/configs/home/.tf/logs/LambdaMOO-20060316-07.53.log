LambdaMOO's maintainers have strict stability and prior testing requirements for acceptance to their server. As a result, 1.8.1 is quite stable and I'm not sure if there are really enough changes to make it worth a 1.8.2 release-- but that's their decision, and they'll probably decide to do so because I said the opposite. ;)
If you don't mind risking a bit of untestedness for a more current interpretor, I maintain the GammaMOO server which is at version 1.8.1g3r1:
http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/gammamoo/
I do testing and all, so it's still fairly stable (all known bugs are documented in Release Notes), but has more recent code that hasn't had the testing necessary. I found the first 'real' bug in g3 a few months ago that would cause a rare case to crash the server-- hence g3r1.

I wanted a shell script companion to restart for shutting-down the MOO cleanly from the shell instead of having to log in as a wiz and came up with the following. Any more elegant way of doing it? (I realize that if I take out the confirmation it can be done with one line: kill -INT `ps|grep "[0-9] \./moo"|sed -e"s/^ *\([0-9]*\) .*/\1/"` )


#!/bin/sh
mooproc=`ps | tee .ps.tmp | grep "[0-9] \./moo" | sed -e"s/^ *\([0-9]*\) .*/\1/"`
echo Confirm MOO process:
egrep "PID|$mooproc" .ps.tmp
read kill?"Kill process $mooproc (y[n])? "
if [ "$kill" = y ] ; then kill -INT $mooproc ; echo MOO shutdown ; \
else echo Shutdown aborted. ; fi

That's a simple Stream * declaration... at first glance, I don't see how it could be a problem, since it's syntatically the same as many earlier declarations in the file

P.S. Ignore Xeric; if anyone causes trouble, its the LambdaMOO team by trying to enforce insane-strict testing on any new features, apparently even in non-Lambda servers
(except, it seems, when a Lambda author is reponsible for writing the feature-- WAIF has an official branch, but is a pretty poor implementation of a numberless object)

Actually, at second glace... that's a variable declaration after code, so might requrie C99 compatibility... if your compiler doesn't like that, move the line up right after 'Var value;'... similar if you encounter more complaints.
Let me know if that helps the problem, and I'll commit the change for future releases

WAIF isn't an exception at all.  It's not in the main server due to shortcomings I'm too lazy to address.  Your code isn't in the main branch due to shortcomings you don't fully appreciate.

I also find it comical that you bash "insane-strict testing requirements" in the same thread where you're responding to a compile/portability problem with your own code.

Puff, if you're still looking for a MOO-to-IM solution, I've written an Jabber/XMPP interface that implements the server-to-server (s2s) protocol that allows MOO users to message other XMPP servers. You can find more information on it at http://www.the-b.org/~kenny/wiki/index.php/Jabber/XMPP_for_MOO  However, be ware that you have to use the WAIF branch from CVS (which totally rock, by the way).

Which shortcomings? There are a few cases I can understand the hackish nature of the code (unknown_bifuncs) wouldn't be acceptable, but in general, I keep GammaMOO-accepted patches pretty clean. In some cases, I have rewritten the patch to do so.

Old compilers aren't extremely important for portability, IMO. What I would consider a portability problem is if it failed to compile on a particular OS.
Note that this is the first actual problem report for GammaMOO, other than the one I found myself a few months back.
One or two bugs in a year really isn't that bad, when compared to most software.

Just to cover my prior claim, that should read "two unknown bugs", not "two bugs overall"

The full list of TODOs is at the end of http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/gammamoo/ChangeLog.txt

Someone quoted a year old moo-cows message at me flaming us so-called server maintainers over the use of lrand48.  Does anyone have a patch to improve the behavior of bf_random?  It looks like the right tradeoff might be to periodically reseed the PRNG with real entropy, such as is possible using srandomdev() on BSD.  The MOO could even generate bits of entropy for the seed itself.

Subject:  Potential support for nulls contained in strings

I was reading some Wikipedia artcle... Java apparently does serialization of its strings using some non-standard UTF-8 encodings.
One of these changes is that the null character is encoded as two bytes instead of one.
Seeing the MOO server's current problem with being unable to handle a null in a string, that gives a possible alternate solution for someone who might wish to patch it.
1. (most obvious, nothing new) Make all strings counted.
2. (depends on UTF-8 support) Write null characters into/from strings as two bytes.
Just thought I'd throw this up here for commentation for now.

Actually it's pretty easy to do (1).  You can expand the hidden storage used for refcounting to keep a strlen.  I've got that change in a cvs view right now (merged it from an experiment in MOO JIT a few years ago).  I really did it as a shortcut to calling strlen, but you could track down the strcpys and turn them into memcpys (actually slower, in my tests, probably because memcpy has a breakeven at a larger size than most strings).  Then the challenge would be to fix the string indexing operations (O(n) if you don't have constant width character encoding) and do output filtering.  Are there any unicode capable clients?

tkMOO-light and tinyfugue works if your system supports utf-8.
tkmoo in linux and windows.
Can't check other windows clients right now.

I've done limited testing with GammaMOO, but once I figured out how to make basic settings I've found no problems with Unicode support in some versions of telnet (BusyBox, OpenBSD, WinXP), ssh, and MOOzilla. PuTTY has partial support, displaying Unicode from the MOO, but garbling Unicode input by the user.

I had planned that a while ago, but I forget where I stopped.

Which branch? If it's already done, might as well merge it into GammaMOO.

Maybe it's just me, but I've never had much of a problem with MOO CPU usage-- the internet latency takes more time usually...

MOOzilla has been, for a long time.
