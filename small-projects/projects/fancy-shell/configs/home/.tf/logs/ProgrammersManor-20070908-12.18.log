You see a particularly dreary corner of the room, a Punching Bag for Binder, a bucket, a mop, a round tuit, a hunk of quartz, a cheese, a whitespace, and a Wind-Up Mariachi Band here.

stormagnet says, "yo!"
stormagnet says, "waitaminnit"
Crag says, "We definitely have to setup VoIP or I will forget your voice"
stormagnet says, "i used telnet instead of tf by mistake"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "You probably need to go to bed soon anyway, right?"
stormagnet says, "how the fuck do I quit telnet again?"
stormagnet says, "so I can start tf?"
Crag says, "@quit to do it from the MOO side"
Crag says, "^]quit to do it from the telnet side"
stormagnet says, "how do I stab this MUD?"
stormagnet has reconnected.
Crag says, "yays!"
stormagnet says, "THAT'S better! :)"
Crag hugs you like he's trying to make you squeak like Sancho.
stormagnet says, "so... the herbal cigarettes"
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet squeaks!
Crag says, "Yes, tell me about the harbals (har har)"
stormagnet says, "are apparantly illegal in Japan O_O"
Crag ?!
stormagnet says, "but I got them in anyway, because Customs don;t bother checking ANYTHING"
stormagnet says, "Um, or herbal cigarettes specifically with marshmallow in them"
Crag says, "What a strange thing to outlaw!"
stormagnet says, "they said that they're supposedly hallucinogenic or something"
stormagnet says, "psychotropic"
Crag says, "I've never heard of such a thing"
stormagnet says, "which they are, um, definitely NOT"
stormagnet says, "neither had I!"
stormagnet says, "I mean, wtf?!"
Crag says, "Is there a kind of non-tobaco cigarette you can get there?"
stormagnet says, "dunno"
stormagnet says, "I'll wait and see?"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I can't wait to read all your broadcasts"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I brought some, and I rarely ever use them"
stormagnet says, "hee! "
stormagnet  ^_^
stormagnet says, "But I'm starting to think that those might make unexpectedly good omiyage if they have THAT kind of reputation! O_O"
Crag says, "So illegal is better?"
Crag reads your new post now.
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I am glad I packed as much as I did"
Crag says, "I'd never made the Kasabian vs Franz Ferdinand comparison.  I think I know what you mean."
stormagnet says, "while carrying it was embarrassing, things really are shockingly expensive here"
Crag says, "FF seems more intimate to me."
stormagnet says, "definitely"
stormagnet says, "their voices are really similar, though"
Crag says, "Definitely"
Crag says, "I wish I could have gone with you because then you could have packed more stuff. :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "I could've packed YOU!"
Crag says, "Hee!"
Crag says, "Disney would be helpless without me..."
Crag says, "or something. :)"
stormagnet says, "it's TRUE!"
Crag says, "Speaking of which, I should seriously get ready for work"
Crag says, "I had a plan to get super ready this morning so I'd feel better about the day"
Crag says, "Cereal, shower, the works"
Crag says, "Though now I'm feeling kinda like skipping the shower"
Crag says, "Especially since I'm planning on walking"
stormagnet says, "yay"
Crag says, "Any idea how long it will take me to walk to the downtown library?"
stormagnet says, "eat well!"
Crag says, "I was going to give myself an hour"
stormagnet says, "and have good exercise!"
Crag says, "I will!"
Crag says, "Exercise will not be a problem"
stormagnet will sleep well, then :)
Crag says, "I haven't driven since you left."
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'll be as online as I can"
stormagnet says, "so will I :)"
Crag says, "I'll look into VoIP stuff while I wait for you to de-idle"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
Crag says, "I'm feeling much better now that we've chatted"

Crag idles: shower
[Idling at 6:20 P.M. on Mon, Sep 10: shower]
Crag back
Crag sleepy, lies down for a while
Crag idles: maybe nap
[Idling at 7:24 P.M. on Mon, Sep 10: maybe nap]
Crag deidles breifly
Crag says, "briefly"
Crag says, "One of the cats knocked something over and woke me up.  heh"
Crag idles: back to sleep
[Idling at 12:55 A.M. on Tue, Sep 11: back to sleep]
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "jet lag finally caught up with me- I slept until 2:30"
stormagnet says, "and now I'm going to try and get some groceries :)"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "I'm still up after all"
stormagnet says, "wow!"
stormagnet says, "I'm back from getting froceries now"
stormagnet says, "um, *G*roceries"
stormagnet says, "wonder how far this LAN cable will stretch..."
stormagnet says, "Nuts"
stormagnet says, "Not far"
stormagnet says, "I should get a wireless hub"
Crag says, "Or a longer cable?"
Crag says, "Cable will always be more reliable and faster."
Crag says, "But wireless is more convienient, of course"
stormagnet says, "definitely"
Crag says, "I should try to sleep again"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "yes you should"
Crag says, "But my schedule's all funky now"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "AW"
Crag says, "It's partly because of FreeCIV"
Crag says, "and OpenArena"
Crag says, "But mostly because of the weekend"
Crag says, "Work was pretty weird today"
Crag says, "because of the new building"
Crag says, "and not sleeping enough"
Crag says, "but the new building is pretty cool anyway"
Crag says, "The elevators are AMAZINGLY fast"
Crag says, "Faster than the WOC elevators as far as I can tell"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
Crag says, "Everything is more modern"
Crag says, "They have those hands-free spigots in the bathroom"
Crag says, "The conference rooms have terminals outside them for managing reservations"
Crag says, "And it links into the mail system"
Crag says, "So if you reserve a room from your desk, someone walking up to the conference room can still check its status at the control panel outside"
Crag says, "That's probably the most useful innovation I've seen in the new building so far"
Crag says, "The controls for the A/V equipment are pretty fancy too"
Crag says, "And facilities said in email that they're working on a discount with the YMCA and childcare companies hosted in the building"
Crag says, "And walking to work was much easier than I anticipated"
Crag says, "There's hardly and slope at all along the path I took"
Crag says, "I may end up getting one of those electric skate boards after all.  I wouldn't have to lock it up at the bike rack because I could take it with me to my desk,."
Crag says, "And it's about the same price as a good bike"
Crag says, "I need to check with the company that makes them to see whether they are OK to use in the rain."
Crag says, "I wouldn't think it would be a problem as long as I'm not submerging the thing."
Crag . o O [ crag spam fill page ]
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I need to turn on tab completion"
stormagnet says, "I ran into the other room real quick to put away the groceries"
stormagnet says, "those electric skateboards are pretty awesome"
stormagnet says, "leaving the TV on in the background is really distracting, too- but it's really good language practice"
stormagnet says, "there's a story on the nedws right now about this bear that was raiding people's garbage"
stormagnet says, "and in an hour, there's some kind of manzai comedy special that I'm looking forward too ^_^"
stormagnet says, "I was feeling guilty earlier for spending time hanging out and watching TV, instead of studying for the exam"
stormagnet says, "and it actually took me a couple minutes to realize that what I was doing counted as studying :P"
Crag says, "bear!"
Crag says, "You are funny"
Crag says, "It's great when what you want to do is the same thing as what you should do"
Crag says, "I wish the MOO had tab completion"
stormagnet says, "oops- not tab completion"
stormagnet says, "the scroll thing ^_^;;"
stormagnet <- dum
stormagnet says, "mmmmmm... I love all these convenience stores"
stormagnet says, "I got some onigiri"
stormagnet says, "and it is delish"
stormagnet says, "and there's an awesome shortcut I can take through campus to get to the main strip"
Crag says, "Scroll thing?  /more?"
Crag says, "Yay shortcut!"
Crag says, "Ok, I'm totally going back to bed in 14 minutes"
Crag says, "dammit :)"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "this stupid game will be my downfall"
stormagnet says, "THAT"

Crag says, "doh"
Crag says, "It's still nice over here"
Crag says, "Dry, mild, a little windy"
Crag says, "basically perfect"
stormagnet says, "the climate here is a lot more different than I expected"
stormagnet says, "really hot"
stormagnet says, "but wet"
Crag says, "That's how I like my women!"
Crag says, "Amazing coincidence"
Crag says, "ok, seriously going back to bed now."

stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "good timing- that manzai show just started :)"
stormagnet idles: manzai
stormagnet says, "good morning!"
stormagnet says, "I just realized I should have been in bed a while ago"
stormagnet says, "I was working on my windbag of a first day post again"
stormagnet says, "I *still* haven't finished writing about the first 24 hours"
stormagnet says, "After that, things will get a lot briefer and easier to write"
stormagnet says, "But that first day, I want to get down as much of that as possible"
stormagnet says, "Because it was so incredibly intense of an experience"
stormagnet says, "I mellowed out a little on the second day"
stormagnet says, "And the third day was almost boring in comparison- all paperwork and getting settled"
stormagnet says, "And today was so mellow it'll barely warrant a paragraph"
stormagnet says, "Also, I bought some lemonade at the store"
stormagnet says, "And lo and behold, it is BOOZE"
stormagnet says, "I should read the can more carefully next time O_o"
stormagnet pokes
Crag returns from work
stormagnet says, "hi hi!"
Crag says, "YAY BOOZE"
Crag says, "Hello :)"
Crag says, "It's about 10am over there now?"
stormagnet says, "I was about to give up and take the laptop into the other room"
stormagnet says, "so I could study by the TV"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "yup"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "just woke up a little while ago"
Crag says, "I just got home"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "nice timing, isn't it?"
Crag says, "Perfect, I'd say"
Crag says, "When does your regular schedule start?"
stormagnet says, "Not quite sure yet"
stormagnet says, "I think I find out at orientation"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "Orientation is Friday, the test Saturday"
Crag says, "Test?"
stormagnet says, "Tokyo time"
stormagnet says, "Placement test"
Crag says, "oh, ok"
stormagnet says, "The one I'm all stressed about :P"
Crag says, "Understandably"
stormagnet says, "I should really get a wireless hub"
stormagnet  :/
Crag says, "Should be pretty cheap over there"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, I'll look for one when I go to buy my cellphone"
Crag says, "The cats haven't given any indications either way, but I'm sure they send their love."
Crag says, "Heh, Christian sent email announcing that he and the mother of his child got married. :)"

All-

It's official! Dylan and I have tied the knot.

We did it quietly, a simple signing of documents on a sunny day in the
beginning of August.  A three friends from officiated and acted as
witnesses.  Our rings are simple titanium bands, nearly identical.
We celebrated with a key lime pie that Dylan baked.

It was a perfect day.

There are pictures on my flickr account.

Done @pasting.
Crag says, "Yay titanium!"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "that's awesome :)"
stormagnet says, "hmm, come to think of it"
stormagnet says, "I was thinking that I wanted to get a cellphone I could use as a wireless modem"
Crag says, "You might have to pay for air time"
stormagnet says, "yeah..."
stormagnet says, "I just wish I could find something that would let me be online all the time"
stormagnet says, "I gather cellphones here are really easy to use with websites"
stormagnet says, "but ssh et all is likely another matter entirely"
Crag says, "probably"
Crag says, "The concept of the cellphone modem is awesome"
Crag says, "The reality will probably continue to disappoint for a few more years"
Crag says, "But I think ubiquitous TCP/IP will be as natural as ubiquitous nation-wide no-roaming cell phone service in a few years"
Crag says, "There's weird stuff going on in that space"
Crag says, "I think that's the main thing Google's been trying to nudge with the FCC airspace auction"
stormagnet says, "I hope so"
Crag says, "In the very near term I think a longer cable ought to be the simplest solution."
stormagnet says, "Probably :)"
stormagnet says, "For now, though, I'm going to go ahead and idle a little while I go study"
stormagnet says, "I have to leave soon for my campus tour, anyway"
stormagnet says, "Maybe the student store will have a nice long LAN cable or a wireless hub :)"
Crag :)
stormagnet  :)
stormagnet idles: benkyooooooooooooo

stormagnet says, "yay! "
stormagnet says, "in other news, I succeeded in finding a nice long LAN cable"
stormagnet says, "and made some progress on stocking up the kitchen :)"
stormagnet says, "also, weirdly enough, I've had the TV on almost constantly, and been flipping channels"
stormagnet says, "but I have yet to see any anime!"
stormagnet says, "also, though there are a lot of insanely gorgeous chicks all over the place"
stormagnet says, "I must admit some relief to finding that there are lots of totally ordinary looking ones, too"
stormagnet says, "ah- found anime"
stormagnet says, "it's all boring so far, though"
Crag yawns and stretches
Crag says, "Yay gorgeous chicks"
Crag says, "Long cable is loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong"

stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I hope you sleep well"
stormagnet says, "my sleep schedule is a little b0rked, too"
stormagnet says, "Japanese tv is *very bad* for my natural night-owl tendencies"
stormagnet says, "turns out all the major tv shows start around 10pm, and continue until 3 in the morning"
Crag says, "that kinda figures somehow"
stormagnet says, "Yup"
stormagnet says, "Probably around that time that the salarymen finally get home from work, and the kids from cram school"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "There was a section in thaty Dogs and Demons book that resonated pretty strongly"
Crag says, "Be strong, stormy!"
stormagnet says, "About how the #1 way of controlling the masses to conformity in Japan is to keep them too sleep deprived to think straight, much less for themselves"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "Heh, Mariners finally won another game"
Crag says, "THat's their third win in 18 games, I think"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "um..."
stormagnet says, ".....yay?"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "they had a really hard time on the road"
stormagnet says, "was it.... hot?"

Crag says, "And neither team was local"
Crag says, "hee"
Crag says, "You should check dieselsweeties :)"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "one peek couldn't hurt, right?"
stormagnet says, "after the test on Saturday, I have another week off before classes"

stormagnet says, "I've found some kind of Japanese Monty Python"
Crag says, "awesome!"
stormagnet says, "a short sketch variety comedy show, anyway, with similar sensibilities"
stormagnet says, "I'm turning into a terrible couch potato"
stormagnet says, "It's terrible, because this really isn't thebest way to study for a *written* exam"
stormagnet says, "I'm sort of poking at my vocabulary flashcards, but my heart's not in it"
Crag says, "you need books"
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to try to catch the name of this show, it's hilarious"

Crag says, "I am not swayed by their rhetoric."
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm dodging spoilers for Nanoha"
stormagnet says, "it's airing on the same channel I'm watching, and they keep showing ads for it"
stormagnet says, "I accidentally watched a little last night before figuring out what it was"
stormagnet says, "Saw a new character ^_^;;"
Crag says, "hee!"
Crag says, "The Hot Toddies continue to rule after repeated listenings"
Crag says, "Unlike a lot of gimick acts"
Crag [sings]: We - died at see, and furthermore I lost my keys.
Crag says, "er, "sea" even"
Crag says, "Of course, they're not _really_ a gimick act, they just seemed like it to me at first."
Crag idles: sleep/work
[Idling at 2:20 A.M. on Thu, Sep 13: sleep/work]
stormagnet went out to dinner, stumbled upon an awesome basement izakaya that seems to be a favorite of Keio professors
stormagnet says, "The wall shelves were filled with keep bottles labled ~sensei"
stormagnet says, "And photos"
stormagnet says, "Old, beat-up, faded photos along with newer"
stormagnet says, "And some kind of memorial plague with the Keio logo on it"
stormagnet says, "AWES"
stormagnet says, "It was slow going, so I got to sit and drink and shoot the breeze with the owners"
stormagnet says, "Including this totally ancient little Jii-san, with all of one tooth left, one the bottom and to the right, sticking out"
stormagnet says, "And grey hair, and stopped, and slightly deaf"
stormagnet says, "Hilarious"
stormagnet says, "Totally perfect image of the family elder"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure the dude in the kitchen and the one working the floor were his sons"
stormagnet says, "That or in-law sons"
stormagnet says, "Tatami along the sides and back of the room, tables to the front"
stormagnet says, "I got two pics, and will take more another time"
stormagnet says, "It was just too perfect- I'm probably going to spend a lot of time there :)"
stormagnet says, "They also gave me directions to a liquor store where I could buy some decent scotch"
stormagnet says, "So I laid in a bottle of Laphroig"
stormagnet says, "Which I"
stormagnet says, "erm"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to save until Machiko and Yoshito come to visit Saturday"
stormagnet says, "They said they want to give me a little "congratulations on finishing your exam" party"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "And now I'm going to take a quick bath before watching a drama, and then bed :)"
stormagnet says, "Orientation in the morning"
stormagnet idles waku waku ofuro
Crag says, "Honey, I'm home"
Crag says, "I hope orientation and stuff went well."
Crag idles: sleep: thief in the night
[Idling at 12:04 A.M. on Fri, Sep 14: sleep: thief in the night]
stormagnet says, "it did go well"
stormagnet says, "but it took forever"
stormagnet only just now got home
stormagnet hasn't even had time to get food yet
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "I got my mo-nay today"
stormagnet says, "So that's all good"
stormagnet says, "After my test tomorrow is done, I'm going to go on a posting spree ^_^"
stormagnet says, "Tonight, I think I'll get myself a treat at an izakaya somewhere to fortify myself"
stormagnet says, "Review kanji a bit"
stormagnet says, "But mostly take it easy"
stormagnet says, "I'm in danger of getting flustered and forgetting everything, if I work too hard tonight, I think"
stormagnet says, "Besides, there are a lot of people in the program who are starting from total scratch- don't speak Japanese *at all*"
stormagnet says, "So if those students are taking the bottom level, and only one level higher than that is necessary for taking regular courses..."
stormagnet says, "I think I"m ok"
stormagnet says, "Plus, I keep forgetting which language I'm speaking, which is a really weird feeling"
stormagnet says, "I'll be watching TV, and someone will say something I don't understand, and I glance reflexively for the subtitles"
stormagnet says, "And I panic for a second when they aren't there"
stormagnet says, "And then I remember that I've been watching the same program without subtitles that whole time with no problem"
stormagnet says, "But there's this stupid moment where the panic, losing my subtitle and rewind and pause safety nets, I feel like suddenly I can't understand anything"
stormagnet says, "without noticing that I'm *still following the program while panicing*"
stormagnet says, "wtf, self?!"
stormagnet says, "And I'm going to definitely complete two levels out of 4 while in the program"
stormagnet says, "That's kind of a default"
stormagnet says, "So, as long as I'm not starting from total scratch, and don't flunk a semester, then I should be able to take classes outside the exchange program for at least one of the two semesters"
stormagnet says, "But until I calmed down enough to run through that in my head, I was freaking out a little "
stormagnet says, "Not taking Japanese in three quarters has taken a real toll on my kanji reading skills"
stormagnet says, "But it turns out a whole third of the test tomorrow is listening comprehension"
stormagnet says, "So fukkit"
stormagnet says, "I also continue to be surprised how much of what I'd been kind of thinking of "stereotypical" Japanese culture is still alive and well and all over the place"
stormagnet says, "There's sumo on the tv right now"
stormagnet says, "And earlier I saw a judo tournament while chanbel surfing"
stormagnet says, "channel"
stormagnet says, "and a *children's show* giving tea ceremony lessons"
stormagnet says, "today's edisode: how to do the three different types of bows in the tea ceremony"
stormagnet says, "and the proper way to take eat candy during tea ceremony"
stormagnet says, "that, and a variety show that happened to have the episode centering on taking this old dude to rakugo lessons"
stormagnet says, "and I just realized that those old buildings I keep passing on the street are *temples*"
stormagnet says, "and that this is a major temple district"
stormagnet says, "because-"
stormagnet says, "SHOCK"
stormagnet says, "just down the street is *Temple University*"
stormagnet says, "right next door to the sort of Japanese version of Fred Meyer"
stormagnet says, "where I went to get some miscellaneous apartment crap"
stormagnet O_o
stormagnet says, "dude"
stormagnet says, "sumo is suprisingly fun to watch"
stormagnet says, "getting my scholarship was a bit sobering, too"
stormagnet says, "of the 300 odd students coming to Keio, there were maybe 20 of us"
stormagnet says, "and I learned that there's a special term for recipiants of the JASSO scholarship"
stormagnet says, "like there is for those who get the Monbukasho scholarship"

Crag idles: birthday party for Nicole and Ty
[Idling at 5:05 P.M. on Sat, Sep 15: birthday party for Nicole and Ty]
Crag says, "I miss you so much"
Crag says, "You and I are the only sane people in the world, as far as I can tell"
Crag idles: sleep, maybe
[Idling at 1:24 A.M. on Sun, Sep 16: sleep, maybe]
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "Was there a lot of navel gazing at the party?"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry I wasn't able to go with you :("
stormagnet says, "I should have told Nicole Happy Birthday earlier"
stormagnet says, "She messaged me on Google Talk"
stormagnet forgot a bit, with all the business
stormagnet ^_^;;;
stormagnet says, "I miss you too"
stormagnet says, "Sorry I wasn't online more :("
stormagnet says, "I went to an art museum today, though"
stormagnet says, "And saw an awesome exhibit on late 19th/early 20th century Russian ballet and opera costumes"
stormagnet says, "Really cool"
stormagnet says, "I took some pictures outside"
stormagnet says, "couldn't inside, though :("
stormagnet says, "Tomorrow I'll upload them and finish posting about everything"
stormagnet says, "I love you"
stormagnet says, "I hope the cats are cuddling you fiercely"
stormagnet says, "Though not fiercely enough to wake you"
stormagnet says, "As Marcos are wont to do"
stormagnet O_o...
Crag says, "oooog"
Crag says, "I had a lot of cider"
Crag says, "I didn't notice if there was naval gazing"
Crag says, "it was a different kind of insanity"
Crag says, "there were a lot of people"
Crag says, "I don't remember what specifically inspired me to make that sanity comment"
Crag says, "But I do remember feeling alienated"
Crag says, "In other news, I did a load of laundry yesterday.  It's still in the dryer, though."
Crag says, "Marco was lovin' on me pretty hard just now, rolling around in my lap, basically."
Crag :)
Crag says, "SLG changed the 1/2 price sunday deal to not include drinks"
Crag says, "And they were PACKED today.  I would have had to wait for a table if I hadn't been by myself."
Crag says, "It's finally raining again"
Crag says, "I think it's getting me down, too."
Crag says, "Just remembered some news from last night I'm happy to relay.  Billy is doing auto salvage work now.  He described the job to me and it sounds pretty cool.  Folks pay his company to haul away their cars, then his company strips out various parts of the car and sell them to companies that specialize in reclaiming materials from those parts."
Crag says, "That was weird.  I just saw Sancho attack Marco."
Crag says, "Not like a real fight or anything"
Crag says, "But usually Marco's the aggressor.  I don't know how to interpret that interaction."
Crag says, "I need a cat psychology book or something. :)"
Crag ..
Crag says, "I'm kinda freaking out again"
Crag says, "Liz called and convinced me to visit her next month."
Crag says, "So that's something."
Crag says, "Now it's six o'clock and I still need to go to the store to buy more food for Marco.  Or maybe I could pick some up on my way home from work tomorrow."
Crag says, "yeah, that's an idea"
Crag says, "no, I should go out"
Crag says, "I'm going out.  Be back in a while."
Crag idles: shopping?
[Idling at 6:07 P.M. on Sun, Sep 16: shopping?]
Crag back
Crag says, "Went to Alfies, didn't have cash and decided not to pay the ATM fee.  Went to World Market.  Came back with unfiltered apple cider (not hard) and half-n-half."
Crag says, "yays"
stormagnet says, "yays!"
stormagnet <- overslept again
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "I think that Sancho attacking Marco means that their relatiojnship has equalized"
stormagnet says, "I think it's a good thing"
stormagnet says, "Cats play by fighting a lot"
stormagnet says, "Yay World Market!"
stormagnet says, "THere's this booze here called Chu-hi"
stormagnet says, "It's the kind I thought was soda at first"
stormagnet says, "And then realized had sake in it later"
stormagnet says, "Or rather, shochu"
stormagnet says, "It tastes like soda"
stormagnet says, "There's lemon, lime, grapefruit, and this thing called acerola which is DELICIOUS"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I still need to run some errands today- I haven't gotten a cellphone yet"
stormagnet says, "And I need to buy omiyage for the neighbors- Machiko reminded me, and I'm glad she did, I'd totally forgotten"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "So far, though, between being thrifty myself and by being spoiled rotten by Machiko and Yoshito, I'm managing to do pretty well"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to start looking for a tutoring job, too"
stormagnet says, "Sadly, Keio has taken down the bulletin board I was relying on to find a job"
stormagnet says, "Apparantly, there was an 'injcident'"
stormagnet says, "incident"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "One of the employers was..... inappropriate, in some way that they wouldn't specify"
stormagnet says, "My imagination, of course, runs wild"
stormagnet says, "But since Keio didn't have any way of controlling or providing oversight for the job board, they took it down altogether"
stormagnet says, "to prevent more..... incidents"
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "So now I'll have to check one of the newspapers"
stormagnet says, "THere's one that caters to foreigners, and I gather its classified section is always crammed full of ads requesting English tutors"
stormagnet says, "But I'm not allowed to even (apply* for the permit that would allow me to work part time until mid-Octopber :/"
stormagnet says, "October"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "But it looks like you've been living hella cheap!"
stormagnet says, "I mean, damn boy"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "DAMMIT ENTER KEY"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad to hear that you're eating, and going out, and getting groceries and parties and happy hours"
stormagnet says, "I was worried"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "I guess SLG cutting drinks from the Sunday deal means they've built up their clientel"
stormagnet says, "Half Price Sunday probably won't last much longer"
stormagnet says, "But I'm really glad we went as much as we did when they had it ^_^"
stormagnet says, "Anyway, with that spurt of posting, I'm going to go take a shower and get ready to go run errands"
stormagnet says, "I'll check in here again before I head out :)"
Crag says, "You're here!"
Crag reads scroll
Crag says, "Hee"
Crag says, "I need to get the BofA login from you at some point"
Crag says, "I kinda failed to do most of the extra stuff I had planned for this weekend"
Crag says, "Like reconfiguring the network so I can use mldonkey again"
Crag says, "And opening all the mail and paying bills"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I remembered another thing from the party.  Nicole and I are going to get serious about running technical classes for folks like Lindsay.  I think Shea may help us out too, but I'm not counting on it, of course."
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "the BofA login is my usual"
Crag :)
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I tried billing@ and the long password"
stormagnet says, "just user name"
Crag says, "oh oh"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'll try that right now"
stormagnet says, "The Capital One card is probably due for a payment"
stormagnet says, "I can do that now, from here"
stormagnet says, "The phone, utilities, and vehicle registrations will need paying too"
stormagnet says, "Man, mosquitoes here are eating me alive"
Crag says, "You should tell me how to do the capital one payment :)"
Crag says, "noes!"
stormagnet says, "I found new bites while I was showering O_o"
stormagnet is delicious
Crag says, "It's true!"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm really ichy, though"
stormagnet says, "I'll have to get some vcalamine or something while I'm on my errands :/"
stormagnet says, "damn typos"
stormagnet roots around for her malled
stormagnet says, "MALLET"
Crag says, "BofA wants me to tell them what year you graduated from high school.  Would that be 2000? or 1999?"
stormagnet says, "nooooo"
stormagnet says, "where did it go...."
stormagnet says, "2000"
Crag says, "Is the duck-billed tree the correct SiteKey? :)"
stormagnet needs mallet, badly
stormagnet says, "Yes"
Crag says, "i've never used the BofA site before, clearly"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "Our utilities, small as they are, will pry be overdue by now"
stormagnet says, "I think the bill is on the table by the door"
Crag says, "doh"
Crag says, "I have all that stuff by my desk now"
stormagnet should have reminded you sooner
Crag says, "No, I knew"
stormagnet got wrapped up in crap here
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I was waiting for the rent check to clear and for another paycheck before doing anything"
stormagnet is having a lt of fun ^_^;;
Crag says, "good!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm sure I'll have fun again eventually too :)"
stormagnet says, "huh"
stormagnet says, "They're re-running Fushigi Yuugi on tv"
stormagnet says, "suddenly hearing it in the background messed with me a bit"
stormagnet says, "can you see BofA ok now?"
stormagnet says, "last I looked, it was doing pretty good"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "rent check overdrafted, but whatever"
stormagnet says, "eeeep"
Crag says, "That'll be the last overdraft on my watch"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I had even moved $200 from the capital one to cover it"
stormagnet saw that
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry"
stormagnet hates on the enter key some more
stormagnet kicks a rock
Crag says, ""Oh"
stormagnet ?
Crag says, "It was the therapy check that I didn't account for"
stormagnet says, "therapy?"
Crag says, "The place with the pool in shoreline"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet d'ohs
Crag says, "It went through on the 10th"
stormagnet goddammit
Crag says, "oh well"
stormagnet says, "sorry"
Crag says, "can't be helped"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I will take care of it all from now on"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I will get a tutoring job as soon as allowed, too"
Crag says, "I know :)"
stormagnet says, "I made curry last night"
Crag says, "Yum"
stormagnet says, "Except Machiko and Yoshito wouldn't let me do any work, so really they made it :/"
stormagnet says, "But it was delish"
stormagnet says, "and I have lots of cheap leftovers"
Crag says, "I'm contemplating having the last frozen lasagna"
Crag says, "Alternatively, I could go get a half-price Sunday hamburger"
stormagnet says, "yum!"
stormagnet says, "Both are good options ^_^"
Crag says, "How much longer will you be online?"
stormagnet says, "I might get some cheap ramen or something while I'm out running errands"
Crag says, "I want to make the most of our realtime chat opportunities."
stormagnet says, ""aw"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "In an hour or so, I'll really have to head out, though"
stormagnet says, "A lot of the errand type places close really early"
stormagnet says, "Even though Tokyo stays vawake all night"
stormagnet doesn't get it
stormagnet says, "the banks close at 3pm"
stormagnet says, "THREE"
stormagnet says, "PM"
Crag says, "I can't remember how late SLG is open on Sunday"
stormagnet says, "unfuckingbelievable"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "That's crazy"
stormagnet says, "you should go eat"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
stormagnet says, "wtf, Japan?!"
stormagnet says, "even the ATMs close"
stormagnet says, "ATMS"
stormagnet says, "not as early, but at like 10pm"
Crag says, "ATMs can't close.  That's just wrong."
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "YES IT IS"
stormagnet says, "It's one of the ways Japan is b0rked"
Crag says, "something must be done"
stormagnet says, "Bureacracy and inefficiency are its biigest problems"
stormagnet says, "or rather, symptoms"
Crag says, "I think I will have that burger after all"
stormagnet says, "it freaks me out, the way everything is done in cash here"
stormagnet says, "when I got my scholarship, they just handed me the equivelant of about $2300 in CASH"
stormagnet says, "after standing in a LINE"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "which everyone knows is for SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS"
stormagnet says, "I know Japan has a low crime rate"
stormagnet says, "and that the incredible risk of being mugged for that cash just doesn't occur to them"
stormagnet says, "But me?"
stormagnet says, "DAAAMN"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You should post about that on junk!"
stormagnet says, "I jetted over to pay my rent right away"
Crag says, "and on your blog"
stormagnet will
stormagnet says, "It's the sheer quantity of writing that's slowing me down"
Crag says, "Will your stipend be direct deposited, or do you have to pick that up every month?"
stormagnet says, "there's a LOT of material"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "After this, it should deposit automatically"
stormagnet says, "The first payment is cash"
stormagnet says, "because"
stormagnet drumrolls
stormagnet says, "IT TAKES FOR FUCKING EVER TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT HERE"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "Not only do the banks close at 3"
Crag says, "But they open at 2:45!"
stormagnet says, "But you have to get your foreign resident registration first"
stormagnet says, "which also takes forever"
Crag says, "oh right"
Crag says, "what a hassle"
Crag says, "I don't think I could do it"
Crag says, "I wonder what it's like in France."
stormagnet also wonders
stormagnet says, "Hopefully, I'll be done with the majority of this hassle soon, though"
stormagnet says, "but it's making me crazy"
Crag says, "understandably"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"
stormagnet kills the enter key
Crag says, "You need to do something about that apostrophy/enter key problem"
stormagnet stops using contractions
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I am getting very hoooongry"
stormagnet says, "I would like to go get food soon"
Crag says, "alright"
Crag says, "I'mma go eat now"

stormagnet says, "muah"
stormagnet says, "the monthly charge is cheap too"
stormagnet says, "but it doesn't cover much, so I'm likely to get nickel and dimed a lot until the monthly bill as more"
stormagnet says, "but I'll find out if that's true later"
stormagnet says, "since my first month is free too"
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "IT HAS A KARAOKE FEATURE"

Crag says, "Someone should make a Firefox plugin where it merges the behavior of tabs and bookmarks."
Crag says, "And sessions"
Crag says, "So if you bookmark something and close the tab, enough of the state is persisted that you could go back to that page while offline."
Crag says, "Your tabs would basically just be one of your bookmark folders, like the toolbar folder is."
Crag says, "And if your browser stops, intentionally or otherwise, when you bring it back up, everything is restored that isn'"
Crag says, "that isn't going to cause it to crash"
Crag says, "I suspect this kind of change might be more than can be implemented with just a plugin"
Crag says, "It might require changes deeper in the browser"
[Idling at 9:36 A.M. on Mon, Sep 17: work, dinner]

stormagnet says, "b) there were no other foreigners around"

stormagnet says, "didn't notice that my sessions had dropped"
stormagnet says, "and I had crap to do on campus"

stormagnet got lazy

Crag heh
Crag says, "checking mail"
Crag says, "yay picture!"
Crag says, "I think you might need to tinker with the settings on your phone to get the colors to look more natural"
Crag says, "I should reciprocate with a daily picture of my own."
Crag says, "I'll see if I can get a battery for that camera this weekend"
stormagnet says, "yeah, I've noticed that the color balance on the new phone is wonky"

Crag says, "I think I'm successfully running mldonkey-gui on ildana"
stormagnet says, "awes!"
Crag says, "Interestinly enough, it looks like the gnome desktop in ubuntu has a built-in torrent client"
Crag says, "I clicked a torrent link to see what happens and it treated it like a normal download or something"
Crag says, "So I'm not going to bother with the donkey unless this default client gives me grief"
stormagnet says, "Ok :)"
Crag says, "I feel so out-of-touch with all the latest free software goodies"
Crag says, "So now I'm going to try to get all the Lovely Complex, as you suggested a few days ago"
Crag says, "These downloads are going to give you pr0n lag on the MOO :P"

stormagnet says, "yeah!"
stormagnet says, "I can do video calls wit this cellphone, too O_o"
stormagnet says, "though it's probably better to do it with the laptop"
stormagnet says, "thoug I didn't find the stand for that little blue camera...."
stormagnet says, "I might need to go get a webcam"
stormagnet says, "I know where I can buy one, though"
stormagnet says, "and for reasonable enough of a price"
Crag says, "I'm sure you'd be better off with a new camera"
stormagnet says, "yeah"

[Idling at 10:17 P.M. on Wed, Sep 19: maybe sleeping]
stormagnet says, "oh crap"
stormagnet says, "I've finally realized something that I'd been trying to avoid thinking about too hard"
stormagnet says, "The redonkulous barrage of cuteness that is Japanese television has a seriously detrimental side affect"
stormagnet says, "It's not just that I'm surrounded by things that I want because they are cute"
stormagnet says, "But the cuteness of the advertising campaigns is actually compelling me towards buying things I DON'T EVEN WANT"
stormagnet says, "I know this has always been the *intent* of advertising, but until now, it's never been *effective* on me"
stormagnet says, "Sex, explosions, and personal insecurity do not sell to me"
stormagnet says, "adorable mascots, little girls smiling with ridiculously huge puppy eyes, and catchy little jingles DO"
stormagnet says, "more so that I was even remotely prepared for"
stormagnet says, "there are these vitamin supplements, for instance, that I'm pretty sure I would be violently allergic to"
stormagnet says, "But every time the ad comes on, there is this redonkulous cute little girl with a tooth missing talking about how this vitamin gives her energy to work hard at growing up"
stormagnet says, "and I melt a little inside"
stormagnet says, "She is combing her hair"
stormagnet says, "and putting bows on her pigtails"
stormagnet says, "in front of this little vanity"
stormagnet says, "covered in teddy bears"
stormagnet says, "and then, at the drug store, I pass those vitamins, and I actually get halfway through the thought that 'hey, maybe I should get some of those...' "
stormagnet says, "before I catch myself, and think "
stormagnet says, "A) I have an enormous jar of vitamins at home still"
stormagnet says, "and B)"
stormagnet says, "THOSE VITAMINS ARE FULL OF @%##@!!!^$@%#@!! ROYAL JELLY"
stormagnet says, "WHICH MADE ME PROJECTILE VOMIT THE LAST TIME I ACCIDENTALLY CONSUMED SOME"
stormagnet says, "What the hell is wrong with me?!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "needless to say the effect this is having on my craving for certain items that would theoretically be of some use to me"
stormagnet says, "I am suddenly so, so glad that Japan is so cash based"
stormagnet says, "and that I finished opening my bank account, and finished depositing my money into it"
stormagnet says, "you know that squishy looking sleeping bear on one of my school folders?"
stormagnet says, "his name is Relakuma"
stormagnet says, "a mashup of relax and kuma (bear)"
stormagnet says, "and the Lawson's chain of drugstores is doing this thing right now"
stormagnet says, "where not only are there various Relakuma sweets"
stormagnet says, "iceream"
stormagnet says, "melon pan"
stormagnet says, "pudding"
stormagnet says, "etc"
stormagnet says, "but there are these little omake (extras) that you get free when you buy $6 worth of stuff"
stormagnet says, "and they are limited edition"
stormagnet says, "and change each week"
stormagnet says, "I took pictures"
stormagnet says, "but this has basically DOOMED me"
stormagnet says, "if the sweets weren't so perishable, I would ship some back home for the peeps"
stormagnet says, "and if I (god help me) lose control to the point of accumulating multiples, I will part with those"
stormagnet says, "but"
stormagnet says, "daaaaayyyuuuuuumn"
stormagnet says, "I *am* taking pictures"
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet laughs her ass off
stormagnet says, "there's a special on the TV right now"
stormagnet says, "asking a bunch of guys about their hair care"
stormagnet says, "footage of these stylish guys in Shinjuku and Shibuya pulling these enormous piles of hair products out of their backpacks"
stormagnet says, "Pomade, hair spray, gel, and a *curling iron*"
stormagnet says, "all this out of ONE GUY's bag"
stormagnet says, "and that's just what he *carries around with him*"
stormagnet says, "OMFG!!"
stormagnet says, "this one guy gets busted on camera in front of his mom for sneaking all her products and using them up!!"
stormagnet says, "bwahahahahahahahahah"

Crag says, "Had a meeting going around in circles for about 45 minutes, then I went up to the whiteboard and made columns describing the three things we were talking about because nobody would DEFINE THEIR TERMS, BITCHES."
Crag says, "Once I had those three columns on the board we were able to sort out all our issues, and Joe said from now on he'll refer to the thing in the middle column as 'The Middle One' because the old names were to confusing."

stormagnet says, "w00t!"
stormagnet says, "I will download it right away"
stormagnet says, "Also, Japanese hospitals are officially AWFUL"
stormagnet says, "They're like airports, except with no security, LESS privacy, and more quiet desperation"
stormagnet says, "And longer waits"
stormagnet shudders
stormagnet got up at 6:30 am to be at the hospital at opening time, and it STILL took 2 hours to finally see the doctor
stormagnet says, "And another hour of waiting for him to respond as to whether or not he could prescribe my medication"
stormagnet says, "To pay, on your way out"
stormagnet says, "You stand in line to get a ticket with a number"
stormagnet says, "You wait for that number to come up on a big display screen"
stormagnet says, "(again, for a ridiculously long time)"
stormagnet says, "To get your turn to go to your choice of:"
stormagnet says, "A) another counter"
stormagnet says, "or B) an ATM-like machine"
stormagnet says, "To do the one *good* thing about Japanese Hospitals"
stormagnet says, "Pay a grand total of 800 yen"
stormagnet says, "which, if I save my receipts, I can get 30% of refunded by the JASSO scholarship fund, and 90% of the remaining from that paid by Cigna, and 50% of the remainder after THAT by the UW student insurance"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet says, "one other sad thing, though"
stormagnet says, "it is fucking impossible to get ramen with no meat in it"
stormagnet says, "I made my second try today"
stormagnet says, "I was so fed up with trying that I just picked the pork slices off the top"
stormagnet says, "Since theoretically, Salt Ramen broth is made with, well, salt, right?"
stormagnet says, "Nope"
stormagnet says, "Feeling kinda sick now :("
stormagnet says, "But now I can relax and chill out for a little while, which is nice"
stormagnet says, "I just got the bill for the National Health Insurance plan that made that visit only cost $8"
stormagnet says, "It's $8.70 (870 Y) a month"
stormagnet says, "daaaaaaayumn"
stormagnet says, "But the hospitals are another excellent example of the bureaucratic aesthietic here, though"
stormagnet says, "Like the line to get the ticket to pay your bill"
stormagnet says, "Mind that the tickets with the numbers are handed out by a *person*"
stormagnet says, "I can see the advantage of trying to reduce the amount of time people spend in line, but forming another line is NOT the answer"
stormagnet says, "DAMN"
stormagnet just woke up from taking a nap to recover from getting up so early
stormagnet had another apocalypse dream
stormagnet says, "That's how bad that hospital was, I guess"
stormagnet says, "I woke up with one of those paniced, dazed feelings"
stormagnet says, "The whole world was sliding into these patches of lost cohesion"
stormagnet says, "Which were, as we all duly noticed, spreading towards us from the East"
stormagnet says, "and in the end, we had wired up these cars and busses "
stormagnet says, "they were either going to take us to a new world, or just blow us up"
stormagnet says, "but do to the cohesion loss, we couldn't tell which"
stormagnet says, "I woke up frantically repeating the control code to myself"
stormagnet says, "2AC"
stormagnet says, "'Francisco'"
stormagnet says, "'Antonio'"
stormagnet says, "35/66"
stormagnet says, "and most panicked of all, a number I *couldn't quite remember*"
stormagnet says, "someone interrupted me while I was repeating it with extraneous data on the ignition and seat and such that I already knew"
stormagnet says, "like, reminding me that this was Japan (even though it was Seattle) so I had to remember that everything was on the other side"
stormagnet says, "oh, and I think the 2AC was actually my way of repeating 'AAC' to myself"
stormagnet . o O ( wtf, self? )

Crag says, "I thought available was always LESS than regular"

Crag says, "The first in this series, which I think I pasted a link to before, but I don't remember:"
Crag | http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/1050.html
Crag says, "It wasn't what you'd call .. good ..."
Crag says, "but it's definitely something we would watch together."
stormagnet says, "I just sent today's photo"
stormagnet says, "I think I found a setting that's helping with the color values"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "I tend to find anything tagged with "comedy, romance, high school" to be very watchable :)"
Crag says, "Checking mail..."
Crag says, "Image received!  This one does have more color to it, and facing the light helps too"
Crag says, "or rather, facing the light helps make you look healthier"
Crag says, "I am worrying WAY too much"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "I'm fine"
Crag hugs fiercely.
stormagnet says, "Machiko and Yoshito are taking really good care of me"
Crag says, "ok"

Crag says, "I sure am glad you have family over there"
stormagnet says, "They're coming by later to take me out *again*"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I'm getting along with them really well, too"
Crag says, "I suspect they're awfully fond of you"
Crag says, "I know I am"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "hee"
Crag says, "I got to be a hero at work again today"
Crag says, "just briefly"
Crag says, "Back when I was in the SOC I setup a redirect which converts urls like kbn/blah into the url for the KB artical numbered 'blah'"
Crag says, "But it didn't work for NoHo folks because their proxy is retarted"
Crag says, "It's been messed up forever, but it only came to the SOC's attention after I left."
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "They passed it around amongst themselves for months, I contributed suggestions, they got nowhere"
Crag says, "Today Allison called me up and asked if I had two minutes to talk about it"
stormagnet says, "now they know what they lost :P"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "So I went over to her cube, we talked about it, came up with a solution"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I implemented the solution before Allison could find and assign me the ticket"
stormagnet says, "in like 5 loses"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "There were many possible solutions"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "But the Right Answer was hard for them to swalow"
Crag says, "swallow"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
Crag says, "they had to do it my way :)"
stormagnet got a terrible image in her head then
Crag snorts
Crag says, "SUCK IT, BITCHES!"
Crag says, "ohwait"
Crag says, "was that me just then?"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "ANYway"
stormagnet says, "naw, it was my evil visual imagination"
Crag says, "that little victory was a sunny 30 minutes out of a week of crap"
stormagnet says, "doing a force_input"
Crag says, "awesome"
Crag says, "I spent about 20 hours this week pulling my hair out over a problem caused by Risk and NetOps as part of the move to the new building"
Crag says, "I finished most of the solution today"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "But only because I gave up on IIS and implemented it in Apache"
Crag hugs back some more :)
stormagnet says, "make 'em pay through the nose for it"
Crag says, "I might be about to get fiesty about The Right Tools at work"
Crag says, "Oh yeah"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I thought you might forget to bill for the hours"
Crag says, "they'll pay... oh how they'll pay..."
Crag says, "heh, no"
stormagnet says, "oh yes..."
Crag says, "I didn't even get 40 hours in this week, though I did bill for 40"
stormagnet says, "watch tv for an hour 'brainstorming'"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "bill them for the happy hour you spent stewing over it"
Crag says, "I had a REALLY hard time staying motivated this week"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs
Crag says, "almost everything I was doing was related to some stupid thing someone else caused that was unnecessary"
Crag smiles and hugs and just generally cuddles lots.
stormagnet says, "the line to get the ticket to wait for your number to go stand in line..."
Crag says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "yay cuddles!"
Crag says, "I feel your pain"
Crag says, "Especially because all paperwork feels like that to me, no matter how easy or useful it is"
Crag says, "oh yeah, more good news"
stormagnet ?
Crag says, "Jean and I are going to see The Go Team next month"
Crag says, "Bought my ticket today"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
Crag says, "Anne will watch the kids."
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "So yeah, me and Jean at Neumos.  Good times."
stormagnet says, "sweeeeet"
stormagnet says, "I miss seeing shows"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "pry won't happen while I'm in Japan"
Crag brb, gotta pee :)
Crag back
Crag says, "Your cats are driving me nuts :)"
Crag says, "They aren't getting this "different food for different cats" arrangement"
Crag says, "They seem to want to share?"
Crag says, "Marco even let Sancho eat from his dish first!"
Crag says, "and the 'fighting'"
Crag says, "Maybe they're just playing, but it bothers me"
stormagnet says, "I think they are"
stormagnet says, "the sharing food thing seems to confirm that"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "Though yeah, is it possible to seperate them"
stormagnet says, "or just get the specfial diet food exclusively?"
Crag says, "I have been feeding Sancho in the bathroom"
Crag says, "But it's such a hassle I might just go with the special food for both of them"
Crag checks the price on safeway.com...
Crag says, "You already have a login, right?  Is it billing@?"
Crag says, "heh, that got me in"
stormagnet says, "yup :)"
Crag says, "well, it looks like it's 35 cents a can?"
Crag says, "I need to weigh them to be sure, but I think the correct portion for them is two cans each, but that's still only $1.40 a day"
Crag says, "Which is doable"
Crag says, "Er, 35 cents is a special for a couple more weeks"
Crag says, "but it's 65 cents at Alfi's, so it's probably less than that at Safeway when it's not on sale."
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "and if it's possible vto seperate them just at night, we could give Sancho dry food then"
Crag says, "The label recommends against mixing it with other cat foods, but I don't know if that's for the cat's sake or for Purina's sake :)"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "I can't leave Sancho in the bathroom at night anyway"
Crag says, "They insist on sharing the bed with me"
Crag says, "Ah, I've deciphered the sale thingie.  Normal price is 49 cents"
Crag says, "So, $2 a day for cat food"
Crag says, "$60 a month"
Crag says, "I think that's fine"
Crag says, "Oh my, my shopping cart has stuff in it already! :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "Is there a minimum order?"
Crag says, "there must be"
stormagnet says, "there is for free delivery"
Crag says, "I've got $48 worth in the basket now and they want $10 for delivery"
Crag says, "They'll give me $5 off if I order more than $150 worth"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "do you need any groceries?"
stormagnet says, "lasagna? burritos? snapple?"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "frozen stuff could work"
Crag says, "gonna have to take something for this headache after all"
Crag says, "thought it would go away on its own"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet hugs
stormagnet massages temples
Crag says, "aw, thank you :)"
Crag says, "I think I will finish the Safeway order tomorrow and have it delivered Sunday."
stormagnet says, "sounds like a good idea :)"
Crag says, "I got up a little after 6 this morning, so I'm pretty out of it"
Crag says, "That being 18 hours ago and all"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, one more bit of work news - the splitting of the group is moving forward"
Crag says, "So I'll be on a four-week on call rotation starting on your birthday"
Crag says, "But I won't get any more calls for registration or data warehouse stuff anymore"
stormagnet says, "woof"
Crag says, "On the other hand, I'll be expected to provide better support for the ads and media distribution systems"
Crag says, "I think it will be an improvement overall"
Crag says, "but I wish I could stick to just unix systems"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So what's your online schedle like tomorrow?"
Crag says, "I'm thinking I might try to nap in such a way as to maximize my stormy time"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "you should do that"
stormagnet says, "Machiko and yoshito are going to take me out to dinner again tonight, then stay at my apartment overnight before taking me out again tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "I'll probably be pretty busy"
Crag says, "So I might not see you at all tomorrow"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I know overall this whole thing is good for both of us, but I'm coming with you next time."
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "I was vthinking the same thing"
Crag says, "Will you be around your Monday morning/my Sunday night?"
stormagnet says, "I only need to prove this to myself ONCE"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "I feel the same way"
stormagnet says, "and I wouldn't even have done that if you could have come vwith me this time"
Crag says, "I know"
stormagnet says, "without screwing up your whole career and all"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "just this one time is probably a good thing, overall"
Crag says, "Like dentistry?"
Crag says, "orthodontics"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "Will you include an online-time schedule with your next daily photo?"
Crag . o O ( I'm so needy )
stormagnet says, "totally!"
stormagnet apologizes for the delay
stormagnet had to use the toilet :/
stormagnet says, "and you can always message my phone!"
Crag says, "I don't have the info for your new phone"
stormagnet says, "oops!"
stormagnet says, "I thought I sent it to you!"
stormagnet says, "stormagnet@softbank.ne.jp"
Crag says, "oh, maybe you did"
Crag says, "Oh, I didn't know that was your phone"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I guess I'll shuffle off to bed now"
stormagnet says, "yeah, it can accept regular email just fine, too"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "sweet dreams"
Crag says, "thank you.  you too"

Crag says, "When I get your phone I'll switch the numbers around and see if I can work with Verizon to tighten down the account to be a little cheaper."

stormagnet says, "WATCH THAT!"
Crag checks it out...
Crag says, "Kittens... in bowls... and they're very sleepy!"
Crag says, "Do the lyrics or subtitles shed any light on what was going on there?"
Crag . o O ( Japan is weird )
Crag . o O ( neko nabe? nya nya? )
Crag says, "Safeway.com didn't like the BofA card, so I didn't put the order in."
Crag says, "But I did change the address and contact info"
Crag says, "And the email is now robert@defore.st"
Crag says, "I must have typoed the CC# last time, it went through just fine today"
Crag shrugs.
Crag says, "I ended up watching a bunch of anime"
Crag says, "I hope nobody's watching me through the window, with my cats and my anime"
Crag says, "The cats have been getting friendlier."
Crag says, "When I came back from half-price lunch and coffee today I collapsed on the bed and they surrounded and trapped me."
stormagnet wakes!
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry!"
stormagnet overslept
stormagnet was up late last night with Machiko and Yoshito
stormagnet says, "I only got a chance to get online when they told me to watch that Neko Nabe video"
stormagnet says, "friendly kitties!"
stormagnet says, "what did you watch?"
stormagnet says, "I'll queue it right now!"
Crag says, "Hee!"
Crag says, "I've been watching Lovely Complex, but I think maybe we've watched it before?"
Crag says, "Either that or it just matches the formula too closely"
Crag says, "I'm still watching it anyway though"
Crag says, "I just finished episode 10, which was why I didn't respond right away"
stormagnet says, "It's very similar to Bokura ga Ita in style"
stormagnet says, "I think it might be the same artist"
Crag says, "I also watched the first ten episodes of "Kenko Zenra Kei Suiei Bu Umisho", or just Umisho for short"
stormagnet says, "WHOA"
Crag says, "whoa?"
stormagnet says, "So a) that's why I had trouble finding the Umisho torrents on the php page, and b) I've got serious catching up to do!"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Umisho is pretty silly and two-dimensional"
Crag says, "Lovely Complex is much more like the deeper romance type stuff we like to watch together"
Crag says, "It reminded me of a lighter, faster Honey and Clover."
Crag says, "Now it doesn't remind me of it so much"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "I downloaded the last three episodes of Murder Princess, but haven't watched them yet"
Crag says, "ew, stink wave, I better go do something about that"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet has pr0n lag
stormagnet hadn't really started downloading in earnest

stormagnet  <- has teh dum
stormagnet says, "I had pirate dreams last night"
stormagnet says, "They were pretty all right"
Crag says, "Yay pirate dreams!"
Crag says, "brb, taking litter down to trash"
Crag says, "back"
Crag says, "The funny thing about my anime watching is that I was going to watch one episode of each to see if they were shows we'd want to watch "together" online."
Crag says, "And then I couldn't stop"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you liked it!"
Crag says, "See what you've done to me?!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag hee
Crag says, "I'm basically a completely different person from seven years ago"
Crag says, "basically"
stormagnet says, "And I am deeply amused that it wasn't just me making us watch so many episodes in a row :P"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "not JUST you, yeah"
stormagnet says, "I guess I started it :p"
Crag says, "I got the habit from you"

Crag says, "so..."
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I LEARNED IT FROM NWATCHING YOU, OKAY ?!?"
Crag lol
Crag says, "it's true!"
Crag says, "Lovely Complex is pretty great, but it's kinda hard to watch sometimes - in a that good way where I want to hug or strangle the charachters, sometimes at the same time."
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I got kind of the same impression out of watching the one episode on TV"
Crag says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "evenm though the Kansai dialect was so thick I really had trouble following some of it"
Crag says, "I'm totally going to bed after this episode, though"
Crag says, "probably"
Crag says, "I keep wanting to get up and get you something to nibble on or something."
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "I was actually just getting hungry, too!"
stormagnet says, "you should go get some sleep"
Crag says, "That's almost always true though :)"
Crag says, "I have to finish this episode at least."
Crag says, "... and possibly one more after that"
stormagnet says, "I've got a lot of anime to watch, and school starts tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
Crag giggles.
stormagnet says, "It's true... I am almost always hungry..."
stormagnet only wishes it were her metabolism
Crag says, "aw"

Crag says, "you should have seen the cats cuddled up to me today"
stormagnet says, "YEWS"
stormagnet says, "YES I SHOULD HAVE"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "that reminds me"
Crag says, "what _was_ going on?"

Crag says, "I dreampt that my alarm was waking you up and annoying you"
Crag says, "And then things outside were waking you up and annoying you so I was closing the window"
Crag says, "only it was like the REALLY old window at the house, only worse 'cause the glass was kinda chipped and stuff"
Crag says, "And there was also some video game type thing going on that was waking you up and annoying you."
Crag says, "So I was going to get up and make everything quiet for you"
Crag says, "And I actually did wake up, only to find that my alarm had never gone off (it's 5am) and there were no noises."
Crag says, "WEIRD"
Crag says, "and kinda sad-making"
Crag says, "yay, blogmagnet update!"

stormagnet says, "I dreamed that, as a prank, we stole The One True Cross and drove it through the Tokyo Tower"
stormagnet says, "It was in an appropriately cross shaped crate, and hoooge"
stormagnet says, "We loaded it on a big-ass flatbed"
stormagnet says, "And there was a street running underneath the tower (I still haven't actually *gone* so I couldn't say if that's true or not)"
stormagnet says, "and at the mid point, the satellite view made it look like the tower was stuck on the cross, like a decoration, or something"
stormagnet says, "And this group of hackers in Zimbabwe got a satellite feed of that view and posteed it all over teh internets"
stormagnet says, "And it caused mass hilarity and pissings off"
stormagnet says, "And then, in some unrelated tangent, I met Frank Oz"
stormagnet says, "And he *always* had somebody working a muppet, just to follow him around, mirroring him and lip-synching.""
stormagnet says, "And at some point, I ate an enormous cinnamon roll"
stormagnet says, "that's about all the interesting bits, I think"
stormagnet gets ready for school now
Crag says, "You would totally do that, too (the cross thing)"

Crag says, "Watching romantic anime and having lots of time to think about you by myself, I'm starting to reconstruct our time together as a romantic anime."
Crag says, "It's kinda freaky, but kinda sweet too"
Crag says, "To think our courtship all happened in the first few episodes!"
Crag says, "Some show's courtships take several seasons..."
Crag says, "heee"
Crag says, "I suppose your school day runs pretty long"
stormagnet returns, briefly
stormagnet says, "auuuuiiiiiiiiigh"

Crag says, "Did you have fun? :)"
stormagnet says, "A little"
stormagnet says, "....Not really"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "It was all bureacratic crap"
Crag says, "first day"
stormagnet says, "Textbooks, syllabus, curriculum, homework, contacts, etc"
stormagnet says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "But there's homework and a test rioght off the bat >_<"
Crag says, "goodness"
stormagnet says, "yeeeeah"
Crag says, "Well, this is Keio after all"

Crag says, "You worked hard to get there, and now you're gonna pay for it :)"
stormagnet says, "Did I mention that all of this was conducted exclusively in Japanese?"
stormagnet says, "Yup"
stormagnet says, "I mean, that was a given, but daaaaaammmmmnnn"
Crag says, "I'm so proud of you!"
Crag says, "It's killing me not being able to hug you in person"

stormagnet says, "wtf?"
stormagnet says, "I mean, I'm HERE"
Crag says, "Eh?"
Crag says, "You're totally here.  What broke?"
stormagnet says, "but FeedDemon and Firefox have teh HATE"
Crag says, "oh.  dns problem?"
stormagnet is absolutely perplexed
stormagnet says, "My Torrent is still downloading ok, too"
stormagnet says, "But it's not taking much bandwidth, and I've got no lag"
Crag says, "If it's DNS then your torrents will gradually slow down"
stormagnet says, "I tried resetting my LAN connection and everything"
Crag says, "hrm"
stormagnet says, "I just updatted Mozilla"
stormagnet says, "But normally, that wouldn't affect FeedDemon too"
stormagnet says, "annnnnnd, now Firefox is crashing outright"

Crag says, "it's tired"

Crag says, "so I know how it feels"
Crag says, "I had this plan to adjust my schedule, and I even accidentally woke up early because I was afraid stuff was gonna wake you up"
Crag says, "And then I went to work and did a lot of stuff"
Crag says, "And then I got home and waited for the groceries"
Crag says, "And then work called"
Crag says, "because one of the things I had worked on broke"
Crag says, "And then I had to wait online for hours only for them to decide to deal with it in the morning"
stormagnet says, "aaaand, just as Firefox started working again, my PuTTy session disconnected"
Crag says, "And then I had dinner at 10pm"

Crag says, "I liked that you were in my dream"
stormagnet says, "A little"
Crag says, "Even though you were grumpy"
Crag says, "I might even have liked that you were grumpy"
Crag says, "because that reminds me of you too"
Crag says, "me thinks your network troubles are not over..."

stormagnet is still up doing homework
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I just got out of the shower"
Crag says, "Yay that you're up, not yay that you're doing homework :)"
Crag says, "oh noes, there's only 24 episodes of Lovely Complex.  There's only five left for me to see!  ACK!"
stormagnet says, "DAMMIT"
stormagnet says, "We'll have to pick a different series for simultaneous viewing ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "I'll try to catch up as soon as I can"
stormagnet says, "the really irritating thing about this homework is that it really is WAY too easy"
stormagnet says, "just..... plentiful."
stormagnet says, "I think I'm going to try and get switched to the 3B class"
stormagnet says, "I was sort of waiting to see if anybody I knew was in the same class, but HELL no"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I'm heading out soon.  Sleep well and take good care of yourself."
Crag says, "make sure you get all the sleep, food, water, salt and medication you need :)"
Crag returns
stormagnet wakes, but has to leave right away
stormagnet hugs and kisses
stormagnet says, "I'll try to get online later"
Crag says, "ok!"
Crag hugs and kisses too, possibly too late.
Crag says, "I wish I could quit Disney and come join you right now."
Crag takes a nap now
Crag says, "so much for napping"
Crag says, "Had an hour and 45 minute phone call with Melanie.  She asked me to convey well wishes to you. :)"
Crag says, "I'm going to try to go to bed now, but I might not be able to sleep, so I might still see you online tonight."
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet is in class
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you got to talk with Melanie :)"
stormagnet says, "you should pry hang out with some people in person, though"
Crag says, "I should"
stormagnet heh
Crag says, "it's hard to get up the nerve to call anyone"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "they're pry waiting for you to call them"
Crag says, "MAYbe..."
Crag grins
Crag says, "I'll call someone... soon."
stormagnet says, "any news on the gaming group?"
Crag says, "no news"
Crag says, "I had another 1-on-1 with Jennifer today, which helped with some of my work stress"
Crag says, "It's really nice to have a manager who can verbalize my concerns as well as I can and agrees with them and talks about ways to address them"
Crag says, "I looked up Zippo's blue-book value.  Even with a condition of 'fair' he's worth over $5500."
Crag says, "SO that's something."
Crag says, "I still haven't payed all the bills yet"
Crag says, "and not for lack of money either."
Crag says, "I've been a little frozen"
Crag says, "I think I just need more time"
Crag says, "and a roomba"
stormagnet says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "And a furminator :P"
stormagnet hugs
stormagnet says, "I'm glad works going well"
stormagnet says, "or at least, with Jennifer"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "this class is way too easy"
stormagnet says, "I'm getting bored stupid"
stormagnet says, "jeebus keerist"
stormagnet says, "bored to the dangerous point"
stormagnet says, "like with that class last quarter"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "I almost forgot"
stormagnet says, "I was going to warn you that I used the CapOne card for the first time last night"
stormagnet says, "well, first time in Japan"
stormagnet says, "so they might call you to confirm"
stormagnet had to rebuy the reference books she couldn't find before leaving >_<
stormagnet bought the new Harry Potter book along with them as a consolation
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "I'll watch Lovely Complex tonight"
Crag says, "I haven't gotten any call yet"
Crag says, "from CapOne I mean"
stormagnet says, "Well, *some* Lovely Complex"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "I've seen all the Lovely Complex which has been subbed (22 of 24 episodes)"
Crag says, "Ok, I found one we should try to watch in sync"
Crag says, "Hayate no Gotoku!"
Crag says, "Hayate the Combat Butler"
Crag says, "I just watched the first two minutes and it's very funny"
Crag says, "I won't watch any more until you've downloaded some :)"
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
stormagnet says, "I'll download it tonight"
stormagnet says, "NO class should be longer than 3 hours"
stormagnet says, "this is just plain grueling"
stormagnet says, "and it's all insanely boring"
stormagnet says, "I'm starting to get that feeling that must be a lot more familiar to other people"
stormagnet says, "that class is something that has to be *endured*"
stormagnet says, "and I *like* studying"
Crag says, "3 hours!"
stormagnet says, "three AND A HALF"
stormagnet says, "theoretically, it is 3 hours"
stormagnet says, "But if you don;t arrive 15 minutes early, you're late"
stormagnet says, "the prof starts handing out and collecting homework and taking attendence then"
stormagnet says, "and I have to arrive earlier *than that* in order to be able to get into the classroom and move a desk so that I can fit into the room"
stormagnet says, "and we get a 15 minute break halfway through *theoretically*"
Crag says, "goodness"
stormagnet says, "except there's always a test right afterward, so everyone ends up studying through that too"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "and we're not allowed to eat in class"
stormagnet says, "and getting up so early, and with so much homework, I have no time to *buy* breakfast, much less eat it"
stormagnet says, "and on Mondays, I'm going to have a 90 minute class right after this"
stormagnet *dies*
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "enough griping"
Crag says, "I don't mind :)"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I don;t wat to worry you"
Crag says, "I'd rather read your griping than nothing at all"
stormagnet says, "but I do want to vent"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I'm here for you!"
stormagnet hugs
stormagnet says, "thanks"
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "Of course"
stormagnet says, "at least there's net"
stormagnet says, "that's making this a bit easier to endure"
Crag says, "Totally"
Crag says, "What's the subject of the class?"
stormagnet says, "Japanese"
stormagnet says, "oh, the second one?"
stormagnet says, "psych"
Crag says, "Either"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "So wait ... a Japanese class at the second-ranked school in Japan is boring you?"
stormagnet says, "I got placed down a level from my real one for review and my health"
Crag says, "ahh"
Crag says, "but still!"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to try and get moved up one"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "this is taking it TOO easy"
Crag says, "you are awesome"
stormagnet says, "it's the other way around"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "I know how important it is not to be bored"
stormagnet says, "the next level up class is the same time and length"
stormagnet says, "but the boredom is killing me"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "exactly"
Crag says, "Work has been boring me to death too"
Crag says, "Jennifer even commented on it"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "the 'tadashii' emphasis is killing me, too"
Crag says, "tadashii?"
stormagnet says, "Ie everything is route"
Crag says, "oh yeah"
Crag says, "I never do well under those conditions"
stormagnet says, "there is only one 'correct' way to do anything"
stormagnet says, "and anything else is wrong"
Crag shudders
stormagnet says, "even if the results and content are identical"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that's the sickness in Japan"
stormagnet says, "the inflexibility"
stormagnet says, "even in an instituion founded by likely the most flexibal Japanese who ever lived"
Crag says, "the bush spreads far from its original sprout?"
Crag says, "sortof like the opposite of the apple doesn't fall far from the tree :)"
stormagnet says, "the word for different is literally wrong"
stormagnet says, "they are equivelant"
Crag says, "wow, that's ripe for analysis"
stormagnet says, "oh, and it has been, believe me"
Crag says, "I'm sure"
stormagnet says, "oh god finally"
Crag says, "Class is over?"
stormagnet says, "and I'm missing Saturday, because I have to go to the doc"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "Yay!"
Crag says, "How long will it take you to get home?"
stormagnet says, "can't"
stormagnet says, "nother class after this in about an hour"
stormagnet says, "well, I'll get home eventually"
stormagnet says, "in another 3 hours or so"
Crag says, "ohhh"
Crag says, "goodness"
Crag says, "I'll probably be in bed by then"
Crag says, "You totally have to download and watch the Animal Crossing movie"
Crag says, "I think I pasted a link befoer, but here it is again, just in case:"
Crag | http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/1074.html
Crag says, "I'm going to bed now.  I might wake up a little early, so maybe I'll see you again then."

Total: 2 people, 1 of whom has been active recently.
Crag hugs and kisses
stormagnet says, "I'm watching Lovely Complex now"
stormagnet says, "I think I know two more things that struck you as familiar"
stormagnet says, "1: the main charachter bears a resemblance to the one in Peach Girl"
stormagnet says, "2: Her more feminine friend (Chiharu) is totally played by Osaka from Azumanga Daioh"
stormagnet says, "her other friend totally reminds me if Nicole"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I actually noticed point 2 on my own :)"
Crag says, "I went to an Alley 24 resident social.  I won a Starbucks gift card and met a nice woman named Kelly who's a network security engineer for AT&T, but she's probably moving away soon."
Crag says, "Later tonight I'm hanging out with Zoe and Clayton."
Crag says, "And Saturday I might go swing dancing with Kia"
Crag says, "And next Thursday I'm going to hang out downtown with Ty, Nicole and probably Ben"
stormagnet says, "YAY"
stormagnet applauds!
stormagnet says, "I can not believe how much I slept today"
stormagnet says, "Not having classes, I did not set my alarm"
stormagnet just woke up
stormagnet O_o
stormagnet says, "I went to bed at midnight"
stormagnet says, "and now it's nearly 3pm over here"
stormagnet says, "You're probably already asleep- or still hanging out"
stormagnet hopes for the latter
stormagnet says, "I'm going ot set my alarm from now on"
stormagnet has finished watching up to episode 12, and is downloading the rest right now
Crag back from hanging out
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "That's a lot of sleeping"
Crag says, "I skateboarded over to Porkchop's, but the weather got nasty so I had to take a cab back"
Crag says, "It's windy and cold and the rain feels hard"
Crag says, "We went to McMinneman's and then we played on the Wii after that."
Crag says, "It was fun"
Crag says, "We played a Kirby game that was kinda like golf, except the ball is Kirby"
Crag says, "And he can get all the powerups from the earlier kirby games to help out"
Crag says, "it's kinda crazy"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
Crag says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "It's still really hot here"
stormagnet says, "But whatever keeps biting me, I'm starting to think it's NOT mosquitos"
stormagnet says, "Because I always notice new bites when I wake up"
Crag says, "Spiders?"
stormagnet says, "On parts of me that were under the blanket"
stormagnet says, "I'm wondering if it's fleas"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "Or bed bugs"
Crag says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "But I think I might be developing an allergy"
stormagnet says, "Because the bites are swelling"
Crag says, "crap"
stormagnet takes some Benadryl as a precaution
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "Lovely Complex really is crack, though"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet watched all of those 12 in a row
Crag says, "The only thing that slowed me down was downloading them"
Crag says, "and work"
stormagnet says, "3 more finished downloading while I slept"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I should do some homework today"
stormagnet says, "But I think I'll watch more and chat with you first"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm somewhat pondering calling in sick tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "I'm spending tomorrow hanging out with Machiko, tho...."
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "those hours that I"m awake and out, you'd mostly be sleeping ANY way...."
stormagnet is skipping school tomorrow
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I WAS skipping for a doctor's appt."
stormagnet says, "But I had to reschedule that"
stormagnet says, "Or rather, postpone it"
Crag says, "ah"
stormagnet says, "AThe doc hasn't finished reading my files yet >_<"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "I still have to go to pick up my medicine ANYway..."
Crag says, "hee hee"
stormagnet could, theoretically, do that AFTER class
stormagnet says, "But since I got permission and someone to take notes for me already...."
stormagnet says, "Fuckit"
stormagnet says, "It's SATURDAY"
Crag . o O ( caturday )
stormagnet says, "HEEE"
stormagnet says, "OH MY GOD I FORGOT TO TELL YOU"
stormagnet says, "I saw it on TV"
stormagnet says, "It is in Shinjuku"
stormagnet says, "It is a Cafe"
Crag?
stormagnet says, "It is called the Curl Up Cafe"
stormagnet says, "You get in by payting for a 'drink' that's like, $9"
stormagnet says, "Like at a strip-club"
stormagnet says, "And this buys you 30 minutes"
stormagnet says, "IN A ROOM FILLED WITHY CATS"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "ADORABLE, FLUFFY, VERY SOCIAL CATS"
stormagnet says, "AND FILLED WITH CAT TOYS"
Crag says, "How do you get a job working there!"
stormagnet IS SO SO SO VERY GOING
Crag says, "CATS!"
stormagnet says, "CATS!"
Crag says, "NYO!"
stormagnet says, "NYOOO!"
stormagnet says, "NEKO NABE"
Crag says, "NYA NYA!"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to see if I can get Matchiko to take me there"
stormagnet says, "We're going to be in the area visting one of her friends"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "and the son of a friend who's been hospitalized"
stormagnet says, "with something pretty serious"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "they're hoping that I might cheer him up a little"
stormagnet says, "being all in a wheelchair but kicking ass anyway, or something"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "A visit from you would cheer anyone up"
stormagnet BLUSHES
Crag says, "He'll be all ZOMG, PRETTY GIRL"
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure he's old enough for that"
stormagnet says, "Might be ^_^"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I gather they're precocious that way here"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Sounds like an anime in the works right there"
stormagnet says, "Anyway, the friend is Canadian, but lives/works in Japan"
Crag takes a moment to feed DEMANDING CATS
stormagnet says, "So they wree also hoping I might relieve a little homesickness by speaking English"
stormagnet says, "YAY DEMANDING CATS"
Crag says, "ok, I'm back"
Crag says, "yeah, that might help"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "How's the cat food arrangement working out?"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "Marco is a punk"
Crag says, "I can't just feed them"
Crag says, "because he'll eat whatever Sancho's interested in"
Crag says, "So I still keep them separated"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I had that impression"
Crag says, "Even if I let Marco finish eating and THEN open the bathroom door, Marco will go for Sancho's food"
Crag says, "drives me nuts"
stormagnet says, "But I noticed that Sancho finishes up the soft food a lot faster, so that helps a little"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Sancho definitely likes the soft food"
stormagnet says, "It's definitely a lot trickier in the apartment, that in the house"
Crag says, "They're both digging on the special diet stuff"
Crag says, "yep"
stormagnet says, "I'm wondering about if, after we get the shelves put up"
stormagnet says, "We could put Sancho's dish somewhere up high"
Crag says, "maybe"
stormagnet says, "Since Marco doesn't jump very well"
Crag heh
Crag says, "I like that the food comes in containers, but I wish it didn't smell so much"
Crag says, "But it does keep me from leaving it out"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "As soon as their done eating I put it in the fridge, covered"
stormagnet says, "That's good"
Crag says, "they're"
stormagnet says, "I don;t mind the smell much, myself"
stormagnet says, "Have you been giving it to them in the Pyrex bowls?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "Awesome"
Crag says, "I think I dislike the smell in the same way that I dislike canned tuna"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "oooh brb bathroom"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet returns
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I'm starting to get sleepy.  Do we have any other business to cover before I crash?"
stormagnet says, "Did you eat well at McMinneman's ?"
stormagnet says, "Nope"
stormagnet says, "I was going to remind you to eat before sleeping, but that's pry taken care of"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "I had a bacon cheese burger with ... *drum roll* foot soup!"
stormagnet says, "w00000t!!!"
Crag says, "it was pretty tasty"
stormagnet says, "EXcellent"
Crag says, "Not enough cheese, but the bread was perfect"
Crag says, "I also had a cider, which was pretty good"
stormagnet says, "I am weirded out by how hard it is for me to find vegetarian food in Japan"
stormagnet says, "Given that Japan is so seafood centric"
Crag says, "Yeah, that is odd"
stormagnet says, "And traditionally pesco-vegetarian"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I blame the monster attacks"
stormagnet says, "but I guess when meat was introduced, it was introduced HARD"
stormagnet says, "It is in fucking EVERYTHING"
stormagnet says, "the other day I got some potato salad"
Crag says, "with meat?"
stormagnet says, "it had HAM in it"
Crag says, "lovely"
stormagnet says, "wtf Japan?!"
Crag says, "seriously, wtf"
Crag says, "meat is expensive, what are they thinking?"
stormagnet says, "that tangent was brought to you by the fact that, because of this, I am actually craving American food right now"
stormagnet says, "REAL American food, as opposed to Japanese takes on it"
Crag says, "ha ha"
stormagnet says, "which inevitably involve lots and lots of MEAT"
Crag says, "so if/when I visit, we'll both have a hard time finding food?"
stormagnet says, "Like, the other day, I was about to ask for minestrone soup at the cafeteria"
Crag says, "Or will I be fine?"
stormagnet says, "but then realized that it might be made with beef stock"
stormagnet says, "and then, as soon as I thought that, I thought.... given the trend so far, it WILL be"
stormagnet says, "YOU'll pry be ok"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "though confused"
stormagnet says, "like, why is there a side of rice with my omelette? confused"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'm often confused anyway"
Crag says, "So that's fine"
Crag says, "new confusion"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "same as the old confusion"
Crag makes his 'aroo?' face.
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "living here might get you to like Japanese food faster, really"
Crag says, "probably"
stormagnet says, "I bet you would LOVE fast-food Beef Bowls"
Crag says, "that certainly sounds intriguing"
Crag says, "I know I like the constituant words"
stormagnet says, "It's strips of steak, with scrambeld eggs and green onions, on top of rice"
Crag says, "That sounds like something I could get into"
stormagnet says, "it is THE fast food staple here"
Crag says, "no broccoli, ftw"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "st00pid broccoli"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, vegetables are actually shockingly scarce"
stormagnet says, "and EXPENSIVE"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet has basically been living on Melon Pan, rice crackers, and soba
Crag says, "you love melon pan!"
stormagnet says, "I DO"
Crag says, "hee!"
Crag says, "I knew that"
Crag says, "It's one of those things that I know"
stormagnet says, "It's dangerously enabling"
Crag says, "Are you getting enough salt?"
stormagnet says, "basically, I'm eating nothing but carbohydrates"
Crag says, "that can't be good"
stormagnet says, "lots of salt :)"
Crag says, "you need other stuff"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "my diet is pretty out of whack"
stormagnet says, "but everything has fucking meat in it"
Crag says, "Maybe ask Machiko for suggestions?"
stormagnet says, "and no vegetables"
stormagnet says, "Machiko keeps buying me food"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "It's the only healthy food I get, really"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "But seriously, I had been warned"
stormagnet says, "But I was NOT prepared for the land of $3 fir a head of cabbage"
stormagnet says, "A SMALL head"
stormagnet says, "THREE FUCKING DOLLARS"
stormagnet says, "I'm not even going to MENTION how much fruit costs"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "that is disturbing"
stormagnet says, "Onions, carrots, and potatoes are the only vaguely affordable vegetables"
stormagnet says, "so I *have* been making a lot of vegetable curry :)"
Crag says, "Well that's something"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "and I've been taking the vitamins I brought with me"
stormagnet says, "the school cafeteria opened again when classes started"
stormagnet says, "it's really crowded, but it's CHEAP"
stormagnet says, "and it has more vegetables"
stormagnet says, "so I'm going to go there more often"
Crag says, "ok, good"
stormagnet says, "but it has clued me in to the fact that, yes, my cooking is pretty damn good"
Crag says, "Of course it is"
stormagnet says, "because now I know what BAD Japanese cooking tastes like"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "anyway, you should go to bed"
Crag says, "For my part I've been eating pretty well considering"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah, that's true"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "I love you, Raine"
stormagnet says, "I love you too"
Crag curls up in your lap now :)
stormagnet says, "AW"
Crag zzzzzzzz
stormagnet rubs head
stormagnet watches some more Lovely Complex
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "I got an email from my prof"
stormagnet says, "They have realized that 2G is way too easy for me on the basis of the homework I turned in so far, and are APOLOGIZING"
stormagnet says, "Offering to bump me up to 3B, *if I don't think that it would be too easy*"
stormagnet is dumbstruck
stormagnet says, "I'm used to recognizing that things are too easy"
stormagnet says, "But I'm also used to being underestimated, particularly w/ the wheelchair"
stormagnet says, "I did NOT expect this"
stormagnet says, "Apparantly, they showed my essay to the prof from 3B, and she said it was better than any of the ones from *her* class"
stormagnet says, "And they went so far as to *tell me this*"
stormagnet says, "I had thought that they might mentioon the *possibility* of my moving up a level"
stormagnet says, "AFTER the auditing period was over"
stormagnet says, "Which is when they said they would be deciding things like that"
stormagnet says, "IF the student asked"
stormagnet says, "But the auditing period is only halfway through, and I haven't even asked them yet about switching classes, because I didn't want to sound arrogant or something"
stormagnet says, "So basically, all it took was ONE DAY'S HOMEWORK for them to decide this"
stormagnet says, "......"
stormagnet says, "DUDE"
stormagnet says, "I have been warned about being too ambitious many, many times"
stormagnet says, "I have had teachers stop calling on me because 'yes, we know you know...' "
stormagnet says, "I have never, ever, EVER"
stormagnet says, "Had a teacher actually APOLOGIZE, though"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "I'm actually kind of touched"
stormagnet says, "And sniffly"
stormagnet says, "Also, I can't believe it took those twop that long to get together"
stormagnet says, "I thought the one episode I'd seen wasn't a spoiler"
stormagnet says, "But I was WRONG"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "I didn't even *notice* the height difference when I was watching it"
stormagnet says, "It just kind of wasn't much of an issue in that episode"
stormagnet says, "But the opening and ending themes are the ones I recognize, so it's pry coming up soon"
stormagnet says, "Especially since the issue of Otani going off to University- and Koizumi not- has been broached"
Crag says, "WOW!"
Crag says, "Yeah, the university topic comes up in episode twenty-something"
Crag says, "I'm so happy to hear that your teachers recognized your genius!"
Crag says, "off to work..."
Crag says, "I got about three blocks away and realized I really am catching a cold"
Crag says, "Here's another show worth seeing:"
Crag | http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/187.html
Crag says, "I was going to go to bed early to fight my cold, but I decided I'd get back online in case you show up"
Crag says, "I guess it's only 1pm over there now."
Crag says, "You're probably having good times with Machiko"
stormagnet says, "Nope- missed it because of being stuck at the hospital"
stormagnet >_<
stormagnet says, "you should sleep, though"
stormagnet says, "take care of your health!"
Crag says, "I stayed home already, napped and stuff"
stormagnet says, "aaannd the one episode I saw was 22"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "so we're both caught up then :)"
stormagnet says, "yeah but"
stormagnet says, "dammit spoilers >_<"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "and now I STILL don't know what happens next!!"
Crag says, "there's only two more episodes, there can't be much that happens"
stormagnet says, "though I'm kind of suprised how much of that I understood the first time around"
stormagnet says, "even the parts that were really heavy in dialect, I got the gist of"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "How can you be surprised after your teachers appologized for putting you in too easy of a class?!"
stormagnet says, "DAMMMIT"
stormagnet says, "I knew it"
stormagnet says, "It had to be the end of the season"
stormagnet says, "because the new shows haven't started yet"
stormagnet m(_ _)m
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag hugs
stormagnet says, "while I was watching it, I kept getting thrown by the dialect, and trying to figure out the parts I didn't get was so hard, I didn't realize how much I *did* get"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "turns out most of it was kind of dirty language, so it's no surprise I didn't get it"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "In fact, if they'd just bleeped, it wouldn't have affected the meaning much"
stormagnet says, "Like, um- he's threatening to do something violent, I think"
stormagnet says, "Or, Chibi-something? then getting called hentai?"
stormagnet says, "Ok, I can guess that that must not have been a very nice word..."
stormagnet says, "I'm amused that earlier in the series, they really DID bleep things out pretty frequently"
Crag says, "Did they?  I didn't notice."
stormagnet says, "OH yeah"
Crag says, "I guess because I was following the subtitles"
stormagnet says, "which is a shame, because it really could have improved my vocabulary O_o"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "heh, those two charachters sure are animated, har har"
stormagnet says, "Watching it again with subs was kind of eerie"
stormagnet says, "because there were long chunks where I honestly didn't notice the difference"
stormagnet says, "a kind of cognitive dissonance, where I couldn't really remember that I HADN'T been watching it with subs"
stormagnet says, "I *knew* there weren't any"
Crag says, "I think I can kindof imagine what that would be like"
stormagnet says, "But it was like my memory was subtitling it for me, or something"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it's really, really weird"
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "One of my psych classes this quarter is nifty, in that the prof glanced briefly over what causes that phenomenon, neurologically"
stormagnet says, "Like that discordant, surreal. hyper-real feeling I had when I first got here"
stormagnet says, "It was my basal ganglia switching off"
stormagnet says, "or in other terms, "
stormagnet says, "I was thoroughly disequilibrateed enough that NONE of my functions were running on autopilot"
stormagnet says, "ok, that's an exaggeration- autonomic functions were still puttering away, more or less"
Crag says, "That's wild"
stormagnet says, "but there's a huge amount of processing power that's normally relegated to what's basically a subprocessor specifically for really routine functions"
stormagnet says, "when things get unfamiliar enough, it switches off, and everything becomes conscious"
stormagnet says, "I knew about the phenomena second-hand, and getting it first hand was one of the things I really, really wanted out of this"
stormagnet says, "which is why I tried so hard to get as much of it written down as possible, to remind myself later how it felt"
Crag says, "I thought it was some of your best writing, too :)"
stormagnet says, "but the only other time I've been that in the moment, my life was in immediate danger"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "now I have the equally weird dissonance that comes from those processes being mapped back into the subprocessor (basal ganglia), but in a totally different language"
stormagnet says, "and I keep flipping between the two so fast, there are times when they're basically simultaneous"
stormagnet says, "and since the syntax is reversed, it's like I'm running through each sentance both ways"
stormagnet says, "which feels REALLY WEIRD"
stormagnet says, "which is why I kind of freak out when I actually step back and pay attention to what I'm doing in my head"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "which disrupts it, in turn, so I lose it"
stormagnet says, "and for a second, I panic, and Japanese turns into gibberish"
stormagnet says, "as does English"
Crag says, "I'm really glad you've been able to go on this trip despite all the obstacles"
stormagnet says, "and then it switches back on as soon as I divert my attention to something else"
stormagnet says, "me too"
stormagnet says, "I really feel like I'm learning something important here"
Crag says, "And documenting it too"
stormagnet says, "trying to"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'm still logging everything I seein the MOO :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad we have MOO logs"
stormagnet losews
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I haven't been checking it into source control, though"
Crag says, "I need to get that working again"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "ooh... brb"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "toilet"
stormagnet . o O ( for posterity, stormagnet had to take a poo )
stormagnet says, "the downside to some of this is that I sometimes forget to take language into account"
Crag . o O ( poo .. for posterity? )
Crag [to stormagnet]: I see what you did there
stormagnet says, "like, I'll want to forward you something, and then I'll go... "crap, it's in  Japanese""
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "IT IS MY NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN"
Crag says, "Some day I'll learn Japenese and that won't be a problem any more"
stormagnet says, "yat!"
stormagnet says, "er, yay!"
Crag says, "wai! wai!"
stormagnet says, "another weird thing is that I'll be rehearsing memories or planned conversations in my head, but I'll get the language wrong"
Crag says, "Wow"
Crag says, "Well that kinda makes sense, though"
stormagnet says, "I'll be remembering a conversation that I had in English, only it gets all mixed up"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "It would be innefficient to store the actual sensations"
stormagnet says, "I don't even notice I'm doing it until I stumble for a word"
stormagnet says, "We DO store actual sensations"
stormagnet says, "but access them linguistically"
stormagnet says, "the more I learn, the more I find that my initial instincts were right in that regard"
stormagnet says, "the philosophy essay was rad"
Crag says, "Naturally"
Crag says, "Oh, I'm glad you liked it :)"
Crag says, "Paul Graham is great when he gets on the right subjects"
stormagnet says, "and when I got to the end, I remember thinking, 'vast holographic analogue stores aren't that far off, bucko'"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "TOTALLY"
Crag says, "yup!"
stormagnet says, "I just got to that part, which was conveniently right at the end, and thought 'Ah- this is where I come in'"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I think that's probably why I pasted the link at you, but I don't quite remember"
stormagnet says, "it was all good"
Crag says, "no, I remember"
Crag says, "It was the making fun of wankers that inspired me to paste it"
stormagnet says, "Hee"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "It was Raine crack straight through"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "you should go to bed soon"
Crag says, "nah"
stormagnet says, "take care of your cold"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "I can't sleep"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I'm not doing very well"
Crag hugs
Crag says, "I still haven't gone through all the mail and paid all the bills"
Crag says, "I did pay the parking though"
Crag says, "It was a month overdue"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "eep"
Crag shrgs
stormagnet says, "aheh...."
Crag says, "still doing well"
stormagnet had to use the BofA card to pay for her medicine, too
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "it was hellacious expensive"
Crag says, "How much was that?"
stormagnet says, "like, $115"
Crag says, "Oh ok"
stormagnet says, "But that's going to be a problem if I don't figure something out"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I mean, ok, $50 of that was a form-filing fee that won't have to be repeated"
stormagnet says, "But that leaves $60 for ONE WEEK of medicine"
stormagnet says, "eeeeeeep"
Crag says, "that adds up"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I know I can get some of that reimburseed"
stormagnet says, "but OUCH"
stormagnet says, "and in the meantime, I can't even start LOOKING for a part-time job for another couple weeks, due to visa restrictions"
stormagnet frets
Crag says, "it'll work out"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag *pat* *pat*
stormagnet says, "but crap like that makes me feel guilty for being sick, which is so fucked up"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "You should focus on your mission"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Take care of what needs to be taken care of, but don't let it distract you if you can help it"
stormagnet says, "speaking of which, I still haven't done mt homework ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "I don't even know what my mission is, so I envy you for that :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm wondering if I can get away with not doing it, if I'm switching cl;asses, but I'm not sure I want to push it"
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet says, "you'll find it!"
Crag says, "I know I will"
stormagnet says, "remember, you're rallying the troops right now!"
Crag says, "You should plan for the worst and do your homework anyway"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that's my policy :)"
Crag says, "Right, rallying the troops"
Crag says, "If I could just get up the nerve to leave this makeshift cabin"
stormagnet was going to take a brief nap, then hit the books
stormagnet says, "the hospital kind of wiped me out ^_^;;"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I can imagine"
stormagnet says, "don't let the wolves get you!"
stormagnet says, "did you get my emaqil?"
stormagnet says, "gah"
Crag says, "i haven't checked my mail in a while"
stormagnet stomps a stray typo
Crag says, "I'll go take a look"
Crag says, "Oh wow!  The horde automatically makes test in *asterisks* into bold test :)"
Crag says, "So your *after* and *taken* are bold for me :)"
Crag says, "The japanese hospital number board picture is not cute at all"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeet!"
stormagnet says, "NO"
stormagnet says, "NO.IT IS NOT"
Crag says, "I'm not sure if I want to file it in my "pictures from stormy in japan" folder"
stormagnet says, "nother one on the way :)"
stormagnet says, "OH I FORGOT"
stormagnet says, "One more hospital hatey"
stormagnet says, "the number they gave me that I was waiting for on that board?"
stormagnet says, "oops! sorry! did we say 14? we meant 24.... it's been ready for awhile"
stormagnet says, "this AFTER I inquired once and was told it wasn't ready yet, and to wait for my number to come up"
stormagnet says, "Note that the numbers are all greater than 20, and rising"
stormagnet says, "My *automatically printed* ticket said 14"
stormagnet says, "un-fucking-believable"
Crag . o O ( the new picture of the day is cute :) )
stormagnet says, "my texting you and taking that picture was my little way of giving the "no cellphones" announcement scrolling underneath the finger"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet blushes
Crag grins.
Crag says, "They probably just mean no talking on phones, right?"
stormagnet says, "a security guard was eying me the whole time, and I think he decided he did not want the hassle"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "who knows?"
Crag says, "good point"
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "but pretending not to speak Japanese does wonders at getting security guards to let you get away with things, and telemarketers to stop calling"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "especially hilarious when I proceeded to talk to the pharmicist in Japanese after"
stormagnet says, "not that the security guard said anything"
stormagnet says, "or that I had to use that ace in the hole"
stormagnet says, "because most of the time, again, they just assume"
Crag says, "that's awesome"
stormagnet says, "which makes it even BETTER"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "You've got to post all this stuff in your blog :)"
Crag says, "I've been telling everyone to go read it"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "no one except you commented, so I got kinda lazy..."
Crag says, "Clayton knew before I told him that you'd updated, but he hadn't read it yet because Long post is LOOOOOOOO...OOONG. :)"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet says, "see, now I have to post"
stormagnet says, "but post short"
stormagnet says, "hard!"
Crag says, "It's hard to follow up an awesome post like yours with an interesting comment"
Crag says, "I struggled :)"
Crag says, "You should post whatever you want"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "People will read it because if they don't I will cry at them"
Crag makes wiggle eyes
stormagnet says, "In my backlog of Stuff To Post are comparison shots of the price of My Good Friend Chu-Hi and Diet Coke"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
Crag says, "yay Chu-Hi!"
stormagnet says, "It is literally cheaper for me to buy booze here than a diet cola"
stormagnet says, "madness"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "that reminds me, though"
stormagnet says, "did we get a email-to-blog address set up"
stormagnet says, "I seem to remember setting it up, but that was before the wirdpress reinstall"
Crag says, "I don't think we did..."
Crag says, "I remember talking about it"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "huh"
Crag says, ""
stormagnet says, "I should really do that"
Crag says, "I have no idea how to proceed though"
stormagnet says, "It will improve my post lag enormously"
Crag says, "hm, maybe I can look into that this weekend"
stormagnet says, "WordPress has a plugin for it"
stormagnet says, "oooh, would you?"
Crag says, "maybe?"
stormagnet says, "that would rock"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I've been pretty miserable and weak lately"
stormagnet says, "I keep being too busy with homework and crap to do this stuff properly"
stormagnet says, "wtf?"
Crag says, "How are you going to have time to tutor?"
stormagnet says, "there's a keigo PA announcement outside"
stormagnet says, "the loudspeaker was really distorted, I couldn't make it out"
stormagnet says, "but it was listing areas"
stormagnet says, "Mita was in the list"
stormagnet says, "is this a typhoon warning?!"
Crag says, "meep?"
stormagnet says, "I'ma turn on the local news real quick"
stormagnet says, "not super meep"
stormagnet says, "typhoons really aren't a big deal unless you live by the coast or somewhere really rural"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet says, "but they can cause some mild flooding, and line downage, so it's considered best to stay inside until it's over"
stormagnet says, "it was raining really hard earlier, and pretty windy, and then it stopped just now, and then there was that announcement thing not long after"
Crag says, "I really wish I was there right now"
stormagnet says, "sorry about that"
stormagnet says, "I can't really figure out what's going on ^_^;;"
Crag says, "no prob :)"
stormagnet says, "but it looks ok"
stormagnet says, "I'm not hitting anything online"
Crag says, "I bet your guess is right"
stormagnet says, "and Japan really, really loves PA announcement is garbled keigo"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Hey guys, let's use the PA!  Ok, but make sure it's sufficiently formal and garbled!"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "Got it"
stormagnet says, "http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/story_page/tabid/55/cat/world/news/3693/default.aspx"
stormagnet says, "that's what's broadcasting on the local alert station too"
stormagnet says, "they're being over cautious"
Crag says, "Taking a peek"
stormagnet says, "and warning about tsunami potential"
stormagnet says, "but no way in hell a 7.4 that far off shore would cause anything major"
Crag says, "What if it's Godzilla?!"
stormagnet says, "I got confused because it's not Tokyo time"
Crag says, "Those scientists are always saying, "it's just an earthquake in the ocean, don't worry" :)"
stormagnet says, "So at first, I thought it was yesterday's news O_o"
stormagnet says, "but it was just posted about the same time I heard that announcement"
stormagnet says, "I know they take earthquakes VERY. SERIOUSLY. here"
stormagnet says, "which, given previous problems, makes sense"
stormagnet says, "but they also love to fly into a panic over nothing much, to make use of all the nifty alarm systems they have"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "yup, nailed it"
stormagnet says, "the emergency alert page (once I finally found it) has a yellow alert for 'high waves'"
stormagnet says, "bwah!"
stormagnet says, "we have a green alert for 'near gale' winds"
stormagnet makes a raspberry
Crag laughs
Crag says, "In today's cat news, Marco's mood is currently slightly bitey :)"
Crag says, "He's nibbling on your office chair and when I reached over to pet him he started to make the bitey face"
Crag says, "So I pet him on top of his head."
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "that is the thing to do when he is bitey"
Crag says, "But now he's wandered off"
stormagnet says, "push his ears back"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag yeah
stormagnet says, "I miss mah kitties!!"
Crag nods and smiles.
Crag says, "I put a towel over the synthesizer and now it's one of Sancho's favorite catball spots"
Crag says, "He's there right now."
stormagnet says, "AW!"
Crag says, "I gave him some lovies for you :)"
Crag says, "he says 'purrrrr'"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "I'm hella sleepy"
stormagnet says, "why aren't you sleepy?!"
stormagnet is flummoxed
stormagnet . o O ( when did we get switched? )
Crag says, "stress"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "If you were here I'd be sleepy"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "I promise to never ever worry you over a 'high wave' advisory again"
stormagnet says, "now that I know what they are"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "oh, I wasn't worried about that"
stormagnet heh
stormagnet yawns again
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag says, "I stressed about work, zippo, bills, that kind of stuff"
stormagnet says, "I blame this on the excessive expensiveness of cola in Japan"
stormagnet says, "it's fucking ridiculous"
stormagnet says, "AW"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "you have needs"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "Raine's need cola!"
Crag says, "And I have a lot of diet pepsi over here that I don't know what to do with"
stormagnet says, "I KNOW"
stormagnet says, "WHAT THE FUCK, JAPAN?"
Crag says, "If I had a potato cannon I could use them for ammo and do some serious damage"
Crag heh
stormagnet laughs!
Crag kicks japan in its stupid face.
stormagnet says, "Save them for me when I get back?"
Crag says, "Sure :)"
stormagnet says, "put them under the bed or something?"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I don't have anything else to put in the fridge, I'll leave them there"
Crag says, "They'll be cool even if you somehow magically appear unexpectedly"
stormagnet says, "I"m seriously craving one now, but that is dampened by the knowledge (haw) that I'll have to go out in the rain down to the vending machine and pay 150 yen for one lously little bottle"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
Crag heh
Crag says, "That's crazy"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "YES IT IS"
stormagnet says, "so now I'm always sleepy!"
stormagnet should just take a caffeine pill, but a nap sounds so much cosier.....
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Don't stay up on my account"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "I'll try to sleep again too"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to go take an itty bitty nap"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "you should really sleep too, yes!"
stormagnet hugs
Crag says, "I'll try"
Crag hugs
stormagnet says, "get better!@"
Crag says, "I'll try"
stormagnet says, "eat chicken soup!"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag smiles
Crag idles: chicken soup ... for the wang!
[Idling at 11:02 P.M. on Fri, Sep 28: chicken soup ... for the wang!]
stormagnet says, "that's not what you're supposed to do with it!"
stormagnet says, "you'll get a burn!"
stormagnet naps
Crag says, "Oh my, you'll be excited about this, I think:"
Crag | http://www.rpguru.com/series.php/1094.html
Crag says, "I'm snooping in your billing@stormagnet.com mailbox, looking for message from the utility bill aggregator company"

stormagnet wakes
stormagnet downloads
stormagnet says, "Machiko came over last night and treated me to sake and yakitori again ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "My delay in getting online was because she stayed over at my place again"
stormagnet says, "As I suspected, my strategic location vis-a-vis train times has served to my advantage :P"
stormagnet says, "Like, 'I *could* go spend an hour on the train, get home early, and have no where to go eat and hang out, so be stuck at home microwaving something and watching tv....'"
stormagnet says, "Or I *could* hang out in Mita, drink, eat, generally party until late, 'miss' the last train, and crash at this strategically located apartment what happens to have an extra bed..."
stormagnet says, "And since, in Japan,when dining with someone younger than you, you always pick up the tab, this serves much to my advantage.... ?"
stormagnet is getting hella spoiled
stormagnet says, "ALso"
stormagnet says, "I heard back from my prof- it has been arranged for me to go visit the 3B class Monday to see whether I want to switch to it"
stormagnet says, "This is awesome on two extra counts:"
stormagnet says, "1: I don't have to turn in any of my homework Monday"
stormagnet says, "2: There is a test on Monday in 2G that I will be missing"
stormagnet says, "3: That they would schedule my visit to the other class in light of the other two means that they really, really want to switch me in a hurry"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeeet"
stormagnet goes afk for a sec to run and get some @#%@!!! price-gouging cola from the vending machine
stormagnet says, "which, btw, is not any cheaper than I would find at a convenience store or supermarket"
stormagnet says, "erm, other way around"
stormagnet says, "not any more EXPENSIVE, and sometimes CHEAPER"
stormagnet idles: hanbaiki!
stormagnet returns
Crag says, "Oh hey"
Crag says, "I was just on my way to go hang out with Nicole"
Crag reads scroll first
Crag says, "wow, you are having some great fortune"
Crag says, "I'll probably be back in 3.5 hours or so"
Crag says, "between 11 and 12 my time, 3 and 4 yours, I think?"
Crag says, "Maybe I will be able to convince Nicole to log in and say hi :)"
Crag idles: back by midnight PDT
[Idling at 7:18 P.M. on Sat, Sep 29: back by midnight PDT]
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet awaits a Nicole :)
stormagnet says, "the most awesome thing about taking 3B is that it means I'll be in the 4 level *next* semester"
stormagnet says, "which is as high as it goes"
stormagnet says, "So, by the end of the year, when I get my language program cert, I will be certifiably fluent in Japanese"
stormagnet says, "which is RAD"
stormagnet says, "and I'll definitely be ready to take other classes in Japanes"
stormagnet says, "To give you an idea, the description of 4B reads"

Crag says, "I failed to get Nicole to login, BUT"
Crag says, "We came up with a plan for fixing WDIG"
Crag says, "so we did make some progress"
Crag says, "and I am full of box wine"
Crag says, "one great part about my meeting with nicole"
Crag says, "Is that we came up with a name for our project: virtual reality check"
Crag says, "ANd another great thing is that we came up with a bacronym: visual ? center"
Crag says, "I forget what the R part was"
Crag says, "but I made nicole email it to me"
Crag says, "so I will set it up tomorrow"
Crag says, "and now I will watch anime and pretend you are watching with me"

stormagnet is so. fucking. going.
stormagnet says, "I ordered myself a little birthday present...."
stormagnet will take pictures
stormagnet says, "Even with all those enormous duffels, I wasn't really able to pack enough clothes O_o"
stormagnet says, "People dress a LOT fancier here"
stormagnet says, "So I was kind of happy to find a Japanese online store that carried my sizes"
stormagnet says, "and happened to be having a major sale on precisely the sort of dressy clothes that I *under* packed"
stormagnet says, "dressy ones"
stormagnet says, "the sort that I, being from Seattle, figure I only need one or two pairs of, for special occasions"
stormagnet says, "right? right?"
stormagnet says, "um, no"
stormagnet says, "most of what I packed turns out to be strictly weekend hanging-out casual"
stormagnet says, "people dress for school here like I would expect somone to dress for work"
stormagnet says, "at an office"
stormagnet says, "with a really strict dress code"
Crag blinks
stormagnet says, "all the girls are in skirts and heels and blouses, 24/7- it's FREAKY"
Crag says, "You're awake!"
stormagnet says, "AND good MORNING!"
stormagnet says, "I shouldn't be"
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "I don't mind! :)"
stormagnet says, "I was going to leave some scroll to make up for being absent earlier"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag says, "I like when you do that"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag reads scroll now...
Crag says, "yay skirts, heels and blouses!"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I really should have gone with you :)"
stormagnet says, "that's why I thought you'd like pictures"
stormagnet says, "AW"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "I will take more pics"
stormagnet says, "LOTS"
Crag says, "cooool"
stormagnet says, "and since Japan has such awesome shipping infrastructure"
stormagnet says, "it will arrive on my birthday"
stormagnet says, "for no extra shipping cost"
Crag says, "excellent"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "just in time for Machiko to come treat me to dinner again..."
stormagnet whistles innocently
Crag says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "she seems honestly enthused about having found a good drinking buddy close to where she works"
stormagnet says, "did I tell you about that part?"
stormagnet says, "her office is like, maybe a mile from my apartment"
Crag says, "wow!"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You had not told me that"
stormagnet says, "crazy convenient"
stormagnet forgot
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "What does she do?"
stormagnet says, "It's a desk job of some sort"
stormagnet says, "I'm a little hazy on the details"
stormagnet says, "I think some sort of office supply company"
Crag says, "ah"
stormagnet says, "like, office machines"
stormagnet says, "I don;t know what her job's like, much"
stormagnet would kind of like to ask
stormagnet says, "but, meh"
Crag says, "Maybe you'll find out more while drinking together"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I had a lot of wine last night"
Crag says, "But Nicole gave me a mug of water too, so I'm not very hung over"
stormagnet says, "so whenever the trains get stopped for some reason, or she feels like getting dinner in town before going back to Kanagaw, she calls me up :)"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "That's works out nicely"
stormagnet says, "almost TOO nicely"
stormagnet says, "I know it's the custom here, but I feel kind of guilty"
Crag says, "I think you're justified in allowing yourself to be spoiled"
stormagnet says, "I've definitely reigned in my consumption when she's treating me, which is probably better for my health ^_^"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet blushes
Crag says, "I'm sure it's a big treat for her to hang out with you"
Crag says, "It's always a treat to hang out with you"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "You're fun for everyone"
Crag says, "And I expect possibly more so over there because of the novelty"
stormagnet says, "she's still totally amused by my love of traditionally hard-core Japanese food"
stormagnet says, "she's been telling stories about me to her co-workers :P"
stormagnet says, "I am definitely one hell of a novelty"
Crag says, "I'm not surprised."
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Zebra :)"
stormagnet says, "totally"
Crag says, "But think about it turned around.  Imagine if Thunder were from over some ocean and came to live really close to us in a few years."
Crag says, "You'd totally want to spoiler her and she'd make it worth it"
stormagnet says, "like, the friend of hers I was going to meet the other day, if not for the grrr hospital!, was asking her where they should get lunch"
Crag says, "And you're that kind of awesome"
stormagnet says, "she suggested Italian, since I was American"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "and Machiko enjoyed telling her that I would pry perfer an izakaya"
stormagnet says, "and then, of course, enjoyed telling me about it at the` izakaya later :P"
Crag says, "That reminds me of an Alaska Airlines ad that plays on KOMO"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
Crag says, "I don't remember if you've heard it"
stormagnet says, "I don't think I have"
stormagnet says, "tell me about it"
Crag says, "It goes something like - do you like mexican food? turns out the best mexican food is in Mexico.  They invented it!"
Crag says, "Or something"
Crag says, "And then at the end it says"
Crag says, "So head on down and have some Mexican Food.  Or, as they call it, 'food'."
Crag says, "that last part still cracks me up even though I've heard it hundreds of times"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "I had heard that!"
stormagnet says, "but I hadn't thought of it"
stormagnet says, "it totally fiots"
stormagnet says, "erm, fits"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "like, it's become fairly common knowledge here that many Americans like sushi"
stormagnet says, "but the harder core stuff, that most people get squeamish about, I get all starry-eyed and squealy over"
stormagnet says, "like a skewer of roasted ginko nuts and chicken livers"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "starry-eyed and squealy like a cute girl in a silly anime :)"
stormagnet says, "or, this one I got for free, as a novelty challenge round by the grampa at that one izakaya"
stormagnet says, "fermented squid intestines"
Crag says, "how was it?"
stormagnet says, "they actually tasted good to me"
Crag laughs
Crag hugs some more
stormagnet says, "but I could see how they would be off-putting for most"
stormagnet hugs!!
stormagnet says, "they comiserated over my distaste for natto"
Crag says, "See?  That kind of stuff will always make you popular."
stormagnet says, "which is what I always get asked about"
stormagnet says, "but then, most Japanese people don't really like natto either"
stormagnet says, "they just, some of them, kind of put up with it"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I clicked on the neko basu on that fuji zoo page you linked"
stormagnet says, "that grampa gives me some of his secret stash of umiboshi when I come in now"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "they have all kinds of animal buses"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "secret stash!"
stormagnet says, "YES THEY DO"
stormagnet must go
stormagnet says, "they aren't on the menu"
stormagnet says, "this was his personal jar"
Crag says, "that's totally awesome"
stormagnet says, "they're really high quality, too"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet beams
Crag says, "Is that the >_< SUPAI! stuff?"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "ha, I remember :)"
Crag says, "Martha loves those too"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "that's one of the ones they never see coming"
stormagnet says, "oooh"
stormagnet says, "another one just today"
stormagnet says, "konnyaku"
stormagnet says, "that slippery grey stuff"
stormagnet says, "I ordered two big chunks of it in my convenience-store oden for dinner"
stormagnet says, "and  had to convince the dude that yes, I meant it, yes I knew what it was, yes I'd had it before"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "you're going to be a celebrity in no time"
stormagnet bwahs
stormagnet says, "my occasional slip into an osaka accent is also the source of occasional hilarity"
stormagnet says, "and I was deeply amused that in my last class, there was one other student who was into classics, and would occasionally (like myself) slip up and use a really antiquated word or conjugation"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "which ends up sounding like a samurai movie to the prof, and cracked her up"
Crag says, "oh man I wish I could see that"
stormagnet says, "it was rad"
Crag says, "It'd be extra funny if you said it all serious and dramatic like"
stormagnet says, "oh, *I* do"
stormagnet says, "on occasion"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "particularly in the aforementioned izakayas"
Crag says, "to everyone's delight, I'm sure"
stormagnet says, "since I had to do so much memorization for that class, I can pull traditional seasonal stuff from things like the Pillow Book off the top of my head"
stormagnet says, "it is teh win"
Crag says, "Pillow Book?"
stormagnet says, "classic"
stormagnet says, "same period as Tale of Genji"
stormagnet says, "but diary-style essays"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet grins
Crag sighs happily
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm glad I got my dose of live stormy today :)"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "happy to oblige :)"
Crag says, "Have you downloaded any of the Animal Crossing movie?"
stormagnet says, "I should really be getting to bed soon, huh"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Did you watch any?"
stormagnet says, "haven't watched it yet, though"
Crag says, "I watched the first part"
stormagnet says, "I think the Torrents were killing my connecxtion"
Crag says, "it is teh cute and funny"
Crag says, "probably"
stormagnet says, "tho I'll fire it up again when I go to bed"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "heeee"
stormagnet says, "one other hilarity-"
stormagnet says, "Machiko keeps saying she doesn't know how I could have picked up an Osaka accent and bits of dialect"
stormagnet says, "and I keep catching her using them"
stormagnet says, "hilarity"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "she's from a generation that tried really hard to ditch dialects because they seemed countrified and uneducated"
Crag says, "Shinya doesn't try very hard, does he :)"
stormagnet says, "so she'd pry deny it to the bitter end"
stormagnet says, "nope"
Crag says, "He has Osaka English"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "you noticed that too, huh"
Crag says, "I think you pointed it out to me"
stormagnet says, "oh yeah"
Crag says, "when you were explaining some of that stuff"
stormagnet laughs some more
Crag says, "You used some of his Shinya-isms as examples"
stormagnet says, "was I drinking?"
Crag says, "Hah-nee, I don't like to wait."
Crag says, "I don't remember"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "probably"
Crag says, "odds are pretty good :)"
stormagnet says, "I remember doing that, now that you mention :P"
stormagnet says, "did you hear it at all when watching Lovely Complex?"
Crag says, "I didn't really notice"
stormagnet says, "nuts"
Crag says, "I was mostly trying to keep up"
stormagnet says, "it was the most pronounced dialect use I've ever heard on TV"
Crag says, "It might sound normal to me because of you, too :)"
stormagnet says, "even when they have a character noted for using it, in the past, they toned i"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "it down"
stormagnet says, "mine isn't anything like that strong and consistant"
stormagnet says, "you have to be listening for it"
Crag says, "such a good shwo"
Crag says, "show"
Crag says, "The last episode aired yesterday, according to Wikipedia"
Crag says, "but don't look, it's spoilery :)"
stormagnet says, "I've been avoiding it"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Oh, there appears to be a live-action movie, also"
Crag says, "and a game"
Crag says, "and of course a manga"
Crag brb, potty
Crag back
Crag says, "It looks like the creator of Lovely Complex hasn't done much else:"

Crag checks mail now
Crag says, "email"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "weak"
stormagnet hopes they do more
Crag says, "me too"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to head to bed now, I think"
Crag says, "aw, ok"
stormagnet says, "I have to get up in like, 5 hours anyway"
Crag says, "goodness"
stormagnet says, "maybe I'll be able to get online from class ^_^"
Crag says, "thank you for the stories, you cheered me up a lot :)"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'll be here"
stormagnet hugs
Crag hugs!!
stormagnet smooches
stormagnet curls up
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag smooches and cuddles
stormagnet idles: snooooooooooooze
stormagnet says, "yay, break!"
stormagnet says, "The 3B class is WAY better"
stormagnet says, "and the pace is more relaxed"
stormagnet says, "and the content more interesting"
stormagnet says, "I think one major problem with getting placed was the difference between instructions styles"
stormagnet says, "UW really cranked through the grammar, without spending much time on vocab and kanji (since those can be studied without instruction, same way either way)"
stormagnet says, "But these classes are kind of the opposite"
stormagnet says, "I've yet to really hit any *grammar* that I'm not familiar with"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I mean yay that you're online :)"

stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "back"
stormagnet  http://www.nataliedee.com/120206/get-on-it.jpg
Crag peers
Crag looks confused.
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I don't get it"
stormagnet says, "I was reading them in class"
stormagnet <- bad
stormagnet says, "the pace in this class is a little slower"
stormagnet says, "so I can follow along pretty well just by listening"
Crag says, "How will the homework load me?"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "be?"
stormagnet says, "doesn't look half bad"
stormagnet says, "it's actually seeming *lighter* than 2G"
stormagnet says, "since 2G was supposed to be an accellerated class"
stormagnet says, "I'm really glad they decided to send me over here"
stormagnet says, "I was going to *ask*, but I expected to have to *convince* them"
Crag smiles.
Crag says, "I told Nicole your class promotion story last night"
stormagnet says, "there's a couple other students from 2G that just got moved at the same time"
stormagnet says, "I think they decided to move us all at once"
Crag says, "makes sense"
stormagnet says, "Including the other dude who likes classics"
stormagnet says, "what blows my mind is the number of students from the Netherlands and Germany"
stormagnet says, "Their English is so good I had no idea they weren't from the US"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "daaaaamn"
stormagnet says, "US really needs to step up"
Crag says, "seriously"
stormagnet says, "I can't believe we don't do language ijnstruction in elementary school"
Crag says, "then again, it may be too late for the US"
stormagnet says, "it's such a fucking waste"
stormagnet says, "seriously"
Crag says, "We'll know in a few years, I think"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I think I might not sell or loan Zippo to Ty after all"
Crag says, "I'm having a hard time with the concept emotionally"
Crag says, "Even though I haven't driven since you left"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag smiles and hugs.
Crag says, "The main reason for not driving of course being that I still haven't fixed the tabs, lights or oil"
Crag says, "I don't like paying $170 a month to store Katie and Zippo, but I can't part with them either"
Crag says, "And when you get back I'll still have to deal with the issue"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "so I'm being silly"
stormagnet says, "loqaning Zippo out to a responsible party seems best"
Crag says, "rationally I know that"
stormagnet says, "But I'm not sure Ty is a responsible party"
Crag says, "that's true"
stormagnet says, "Martha might be better"
stormagnet says, "If she were willing"
Crag says, "She doesn't want Zippo"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's sticky"
Crag says, "The most sensible thing to do is probably to just sell it"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "I could probably sell it really fast if I priced it at $4k"
Crag says, "especially if I spent the money to fix the cosmetic stuff"
Crag says, "but I get panicky thinking about it"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "better to loan it to a responsible friend with the promise of getting it back later"
Crag says, "I don't think anybody besides Ty wants it"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that's the real problem"
stormagnet says, "any coworkers?"
stormagnet says, "looking for a short-term car?""
Crag says, "that's an idea"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'll ask around"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Do you know where the title is?  Is it in the filing cabinet in storage?"
stormagnet says, "yep"
Crag says, "good thing the filing cabinet is in front, heh"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "I was vreally happy to see that"
stormagnet says, "this prof spends a realluy long time explaining things everybody already knows"
stormagnet says, "which is kind of ok"
stormagnet says, "because it gives me the breathing room to tune in and out"
Crag says, "lucky me!"
stormagnet says, "which makes the class go MUCH faster, from my perspective"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I hate being forced via random participation to pay full attention to something BORING and EASY"
Crag says, "So all I've done today: watch anime, pick up tea and half-n-half from Whole Foods, half-price Sunday breakfast."
stormagnet says, "which makes this better on 3 counts"
stormagnet says, "EXCELLENT"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "i APPROVE YOUR SUNDAY"
Crag says, "I'm glad"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "you were hanging out yesterday"
Crag says, "For a while, yeah"
stormagnet says, "that was a good use of a Saturday, too"
stormagnet says, "I'm really glad"
Crag says, "And I paid the parking and utilities"
stormagnet says, "and though this stuff is stressing you out, I think it's a good opportunity to get better at it"
stormagnet hugs
Crag nods and hugs
Crag says, "I'm pretty shocked at how hard this has been for me"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I hope it gets easier"
Crag says, "It has to, somehow"
stormagnet says, "organizing it and doing it while doing something fun tends to help"
stormagnet says, "for me, at least"
stormagnet says, "treat it like work"
stormagnet says, "design an infrastructure"
stormagnet says, "and give it documentation"
Crag says, "my brain is too foggy"
stormagnet says, "so, like, document what date and how much something requires, and set up autobillpay, with a warning to let you iknow how much of the paycheck it will take"
Crag says, "Oh I did that already :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I have that table up on the whiteboard by the door"
stormagnet says, "then you're well on your way"
stormagnet says, "just iterate through it"
Crag says, "green circle next to stuff that's already done for this cycle"
stormagnet says, "eeeeexxxxceellllent"
stormagnet says, "and I thought"
stormagnet says, "it ought to be possible to drop my number down to a super few minute plan or something"
stormagnet says, "which will save considerable cash"
Crag says, "Yeah, I'm waiting to get the phone from you before I deal with Verizon"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet says, "I'd kind of been enjoying using it just as a music player and camera"
Crag heh
Crag says, "Can't you use your new one for all that?"
stormagnet whistles
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "but it can't take a 2g card, for some reason"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Do you want to hold on to the chocolate then?"
stormagnet says, "and  I can;t figure out how to get it to stop making this annoying shutter sound whenever you use the camera"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I was kind of thinking... since you weren't going to use it anyway...."
Crag says, "I was going to use it"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "That was the whole plan"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I thought you were reluctant"
stormagnet says, "and wanted to keep using your old phone"
Crag says, "my phone is about to die :)"
stormagnet says, "I will send it back, then"
Crag says, "I like my old phone, but it's not long for the world"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet hugs
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "I'm sure I'll get used to the new phone"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I didn't like my current phone at first, but after a few days I adjusted"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet remembers
Crag says, "And likewise with the one before that"
Crag says, "I do still miss my old Sony :)"
stormagnet says, "I will mail you a brick"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "with a notecard glued to the front"
stormagnet that you can write on
Crag says, "and throw at people?"
stormagnet says, "and then loses"
Crag laughs
Crag hi5s you :)
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "man, I just got a craving for a Chicago dog and an exploding handshake"
Crag says, "eh?"
stormagnet says, "can you explode on a hi5?"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "I suppose"
Crag says, "I have no idea how that would wor"
Crag says, "k"
stormagnet says, "I wish you'd come McLeoding with us more often while I was still there :/"
stormagnet says, "It's a lot more efficient for me to get homesick for things that are all in one place"
Crag laughs
stormagnet's brain is exhausted from running all over Memory Ln. in Downtown Seattle
Crag says, "I've been reviewing my memories too"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "nothing's come of it though"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "my best barometer for things is how interesting of a memory they'll make"
stormagnet says, "I think it's the best measure a person can have for how well they've lived their life"
stormagnet says, "not always *fun* memories, but interesting"
Crag says, "My memories with you are definitely the most interesting."
stormagnet beams
stormagnet says, "I was hoping to make some good memories for you too"
Crag says, "You have!"
stormagnet says, "which is why I kept bullying you into things :P"
Crag says, "I know, and I'm glad :)"
stormagnet hugs
Crag says, "everything is better with you"
Crag says, "even dental hygene"
Crag says, "Which reminds me"
Crag says, "There's a dentist in the new building work moved to"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "hope they're good"
Crag says, "yeah, me too"
stormagnet says, "I'm HELLA overdue for a cleaning, and will be moreso by the time I get back"
Crag says, "can't be helped :)"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "I brush really well, and floss and all that, so it's pry fine"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I think maybe I won't do half price dinner afterall"
Crag says, "It's a little too lonely to go to SLG by myself all the time"
Crag says, "I'm heating up some chili instead"
Crag says, "almost time for me to go to bed"
Crag idles: sleeeeeep
[Idling at 8:58 P.M. on Sun, Sep 30: sleeeeeep]
Crag says, "actually, I'm still up"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "yeah chili!"
Crag says, "I'm still here :)"
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "hugs"
Crag says, "I had too much tea"
stormagnet says, "oooog"
Crag says, "vocal hugs!"
stormagnet says, "me too, this morning"
stormagnet says, "it gave me the upset tummy"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet is awake, thoughy, which is what counts
Crag says, "Are you between classes now?"
stormagnet says, "nope"
Crag says, "oh, home?"
stormagnet says, "but again, the class is one in which the prof speaks very slowly"
stormagnet WISHES
Crag says, "oh, heh"
stormagnet says, "it's an intereswting class"
stormagnet says, "but it's not using all my bandwidth"
Crag says, "You have a lot of bandwidth to begin with"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "basically"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I'm pretending that this typing is me taking notes"
stormagnet says, "because I are studious"
Crag says, "Not only do you have enough bandwidth for this class, but you're thinking in two languages at once"
stormagnet says, "naw, this one's in english"
stormagnet says, "well, I do kind of switch in and out anyway"
Crag says, "Oh, they have classes in English?"
stormagnet says, "as does the prof- she toggles"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "the psych classes I'm taking now are in Enlish"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet says, "next quarter, I should be able to take some in Japanese"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's kind of crazy"
stormagnet says, "these classes are really easy"
stormagnet says, "but worth more credit"
Crag says, "The other class you were chatting with me in was in Japenese though, right?"
Crag says, "That is kinda crazy"
stormagnet says, "because anything taught in English seems to automatically be an 'advanced' class"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but I"m going to be way better at interpreting now that I'm doing this"
Crag says, "I bet!"
stormagnet says, "getting used to keeping both bands open at once"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "it totally rewires everything"
Crag says, "I've always thought live interpreters are amazing and cool"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "they are BADASS"
Crag says, "Which is also why I like when we're watching anime and you mention mistakes in the translations :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I"m no good at the real-time, though"
Crag says, "it won't be long"
stormagnet says, "when I do that, I tend to lose the thread"
stormagnet hopes so!
stormagnet says, "meh"
stormagnet is hooongry
Crag says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "I really need to start packing lunches"
stormagnet says, "the cafeteria was too slammed to get lunch"
Crag says, "bento!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag grins.
stormagnet WANTS
stormagnet says, "I could also bring myself just something small and snacky from the convenience store and hyave a late lunch after class, when the cafeteria is starting to empty out"
stormagnet says, "but before the dinner rush"
Crag says, "bringing food from home is clearly the winning move"
Crag says, "Now that I've scouted out all the nearby food at work and found it all lacking I may resort to brining food from home"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "sounds like a good plan"
Crag says, "I still don't have a working badge"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
stormagnet says, "classic wdig"
Crag says, "BAYsically :)"
stormagnet says, "muah"
Crag says, "I hear your voice when I think of that word now"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "our lecture has switched towards the growing trend of global nomadism"
stormagnet says, "the precise thing I was talking to you about, and forecasting for the future"
Crag says, "cool!"
stormagnet says, "that culture and identity and lifestyle are going transglobal"
stormagnet says, "yep"
stormagnet says, "sweeeet"
stormagnet says, "that we should expect that it will become common to live for a prolonged time in 3 or 4 different countries in our lives"
Crag says, "That ought to help out with some of the problems we've talked about"
stormagnet says, "personally, I'm hoping to go way past that :P"
stormagnet says, "oh yes"
stormagnet says, "those problems are walls closing"
stormagnet says, "they're reactionary/protectionist/nationalit urges"
stormagnet says, "an attempt to defend old roles and identities that are rapidly becoming irrelevant and obsolete"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "all that shouting over offshoring skilled labor?"
stormagnet says, "India is officially importing American and Japanese programmers now"
Crag laughs
stormagnet saw that one coming
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "didn't think it would be that fast, but then, I didn't count on Bush fucking up the economy as thoroughly as he managed"
Crag says, "There's a lot of stuff in place to speed up those kinds of changes now"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "and more are coming"
Crag says, "naturally"
stormagnet looks forward to suborbitals
Crag says, "it's like that whole "routing around the damage" thing of the internet, but for people"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "YES YES YES"
stormagnet says, "you get it!"
stormagnet hi5s
Crag laughs and hi5s. :)
stormagnet says, "hell, I can't wait until we can start *living* in orbitals"
stormagnet says, "get away from all this @%#$@! gravity"
Crag says, "yes, that would be pretty good for you"
Crag says, "and many others"
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "omfg the prof just rang a bell for quiet"
stormagnet curls up in a quivering ball of stifled laughter
Crag heee
stormagnet says, "also, oooh"
stormagnet says, "the answer to racism is to not look at people from other races!"
Crag?
stormagnet says, "if a foreigner is playing sumo, he should dye his hair black"
stormagnet says, "so that people will not feel uncomfortable"
stormagnet says, "in that traditional setting"
Crag says, "ahh"
stormagnet says, "looking at his blond hair"
stormagnet .....
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "oy vey"

[Idling at 11:17 P.M. on Sun, Sep 30: trying to sleep]
stormagnet says, "OH. MY. GOD"
stormagnet says, "I just *had* to look"
stormagnet says, "It was bugging me"
stormagnet says, "And now I know"
stormagnet says, "Out of roughly 3 MILLION college aged Japanese students with physical disabilities"
stormagnet says, "3000 take college entrance exams"
stormagnet says, "and 500b are accepted"
stormagnet says, "this is the *new* statistic"
stormagnet says, "they are *bragging* about it"
stormagnet jawdrops
stormagnet says, "I knew it was bad, but.... damn"
stormagnet says, "That's in ALL of JAPAN"
stormagnet says, "ALL physical disabilities"
stormagnet says, "we're not even TALKING about mental disabilities"
stormagnet says, "jesus fucking christ"
stormagnet says, "FIVE."
stormagnet says, "HUNDRED."
stormagnet says, "OH HAI"
stormagnet says, "THE NATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CHARGES FOR ITS COUNSELING SERVICES"
stormagnet says, "NICE ONE, GUYS"
stormagnet says, "that's it"
stormagnet says, "I lasted nearly a month"
stormagnet says, "but I'm really starting to feel militant"
stormagnet says, "at the very least, I'm going to hunt down any sort of publication, bureau, service, or organization for people with disabilities and try to use them as a broadcast point to say "HEY GUYS SRSLY COME STUDY IN THE US IF NOTHING ELSE, OK?! WE HAVE A *LAW* AGAINST KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR BEING DISABLED. SRSLY.""
stormagnet says, "Which, btw, exchange programs based in the US are bound to comply with"
stormagnet says, "Not that they would ever fucking dare try it"
stormagnet says, "omg so angry"
stormagnet says, "did I mention that that 500 was including 'special' programs"
stormagnet says, "including these half-assed 'vocational' colleges for 'special needs'"
stormagnet says, "that teach you how to work on an assembly line"
stormagnet fumes
stormagnet says, "oh so angry"
stormagnet says, "I had thought I had detected a seriously 'tatemae' aspect to what 'barrer-free' facilities there were on campus"
stormagnet says, "and that suspicion is confirmed"
stormagnet says, "I went looking because of that thing earlier about race"
stormagnet says, "and it popped into my head heading home from class that despite racism, which is still a massive unadressed problem here, there were more minority (in Japan) students at that University than disabled"
stormagnet says, "and then I started thinking"
stormagnet says, "I'd sort of been keeping an eye out"
stormagnet says, "not really expecting to see *much*, but *something*"
stormagnet says, "and I figured, you know, not all handicaps can be *seen*"
stormagnet says, "and being kind of new to this myself, I didn't really figure it was my place"
stormagnet says, "but now I'm sure of it"
stormagnet says, "I'm the only one"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "FIVE"
stormagnet says, "HUNDRED"
stormagnet says, "I cannot fucking believe it"
stormagnet says, "That wasn't even *counting* those who were institutionalized for their handicaps"
stormagnet says, "YEAH"
stormagnet says, "THEY STILL DO THAT HERE, BY THE WAY"
stormagnet says, "Not the nice 'retirement home' type, either"
stormagnet says, "and not just for the severely mentally disabled"

stormagnet says, "even though the whole time-zone thing pretty much invalidates that :P"
stormagnet says, "but, um, happy birthday to me!"
stormagnet says, "when Maciko took me out to hang out on Saturday, I had forgotten about it"
stormagnet O_o
stormagnet says, "I think I kind of forgot last year"
stormagnet says, "next year I'm having a little-kid style party"
stormagnet says, "with a pinata"
stormagnet says, "and cake"
stormagnet so swears
stormagnet says, "there's something wrong about forgetting your birthday, and not thinking it's fun"
stormagnet says, "I think that's the first step to getting old :/"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I'll see you when I wake up"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Happy birthday!"
Crag heads off to work
Crag says, "and now I'm home again"
Crag says, "whee"
Crag says, "I FINALLY got my new disney badge"

Crag says, "yay"
Crag says, "OH!  Lovely Complex 23 is out, as well as the last two parts of the Animal Crossing movie!"
Crag says, "Ah, also the last three episodes of Nana"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "If I'd known you were going to stay up I would have gotten up early to hang out with you at midnight your time."
Crag says, "the sigh is about Nana being over, not the midnight thing"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet wakes
stormagnet says, "slept in like crazy ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "I have no classes on Tuesday"
stormagnet says, "I do have an appt to go switch my classes at 1:30, though ^_^"

stormagnet downloads!
Crag says, "Happy birthday again :)"
Crag says, "I'm going to bed now.  Maybe I'll catch you in the morning."
Crag says, "active cats interfere with plans for sleep"
Crag says, "I've only seen a few minutes so far, but I think you'll like this too:"

stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I'm back from my appointment"
Crag says, "I'm still here :)"
stormagnet says, "I was all afk 'cause I thought you were asleep"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I should be, but oh well"
Crag says, "I'm watching the first episode of that last series I pasted at you"
stormagnet says, "I killed my torrents because they were killing my net, but I might turn them back on later so I can watch what you're watching"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "You will definitely like this one.  Cute and funny."
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "I will try to get my torrents to play nice"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "If you throttle them I'm sure they'll be fine"
Crag says, "There's a windows version of mldonkey if you need a better client"
Crag says, "I'm using the throttling to try not to subject you to pr0n lag :)"
stormagnet says, "oooh- that might be good"
Crag says, "mldonkey.sf.net"
stormagnet says, "I did have them throttled, even stopped"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "I'm having trouble figuring out what could be causing so much trouble"
Crag says, "maybe there's automation in place to make trouble for anyone using the default torrent ports"
stormagnet says, "I was wondering"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "see, I just turned it on"
stormagnet says, "I have it throttled, I'm only downloading one file, no seeding"
stormagnet says, "only getting about 8 kbps down"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "and my tcp/ip is hosed"
stormagnet says, "ssh is fine"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "SO"
stormagnet says, "WEIRD"
stormagnet says, "oh?"
Crag says, "What's your IP?"
stormagnet says, "dynamic"
Crag says, "private or public?"
Crag says, "If it's private you will get crap torrent performance"
stormagnet says, "can't tell"
stormagnet says, "192.168.168.11"
Crag says, "ipconfig will tell you your current IP and then you can tell from the prefix"
Crag says, "That's private"
Crag says, "192.168.*"
Crag says, "So that's why"
stormagnet says, "ah-hah"
stormagnet says, "didn't know how to tell private from public"
stormagnet says, "anyway I can fix that?"
Crag says, "The other two prefixes are 10.* and 172.16.* through 172.31.*"
stormagnet says, "er, any way?"
Crag says, "no way"
stormagnet says, "I knew 10."
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag says, "You'd need the router that's masquerading you to do port forwarding"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It took me several days to figure that out over here"
Crag says, "I was staring at these downloads which claimed to have no sources, while animesuki was saying there were dozens"
stormagnet says, "the download speed isn't all that big of a problem, I can be patient"
stormagnet says, "but I totally need to find a way to keep it from nuking my browsing"
Crag says, "it shouldn't interfere with browsing.  hm..."
stormagnet says, "can I just download the files you downloaded from wrqack?"
Crag says, "You could try.  I've been storing them all on ildana so I'll have to put them somewhere on wrack for you"
Crag says, "The stuff I haven't moved yet is in /usr/local/avclub/mldonkey/incoming"
stormagnet says, "I like the idea of our having a shared store"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "me too"
Crag says, "I'm tempted to get another hard drive so I can re-arrange all our files to be more sensible"
stormagnet says, "my laptop HD is pretty full, too"
Crag says, "a 500 gig drive is only $150 now"
stormagnet says, "I'm thinking of getting one of those big USB ones"
stormagnet says, "they're really cheap here"
Crag says, "oh, that'd be good"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I bet!"
Crag says, "want"
Crag says, "but what I really want now"
Crag says, "is..."
Crag looks it up
Crag says, "oh noes, it's gone!"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "there was a 24" 1920x1200 LCD monitor on pricegrabber"
Crag says, "for $299.99"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
stormagnet says, "shiny!"
Crag says, "Cheapest one is now $384"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag says, "I should have made an impulse buy!"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "we should totally get one of those an HD tuner card"
stormagnet says, "that would be awes"
Crag says, "Here's the model I was looking at:"
Crag | http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/48689851/
Crag says, "There were two sellers a couple days ago"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "how do I get to wrack now?"
Crag says, "I guess they ran out at the $299 price"
Crag says, "You'll want to try to scp"
stormagnet says, "I mean, as a network mount?"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "pooh"
Crag says, "I don't think I have samba running"
Crag says, "It wouldn't work well long distance anyway"
Crag says, "There might be a better way..."
Crag thinks on it
Crag says, "It's not coming to me"
Crag says, "I was thinking rsync would resume stalled downloads"
Crag says, "But I'm not sure"
Crag says, "Marco has claimed my lap in the name of the queen"
stormagnet says, "yeah it will"
stormagnet used rsync with resume before
Crag says, "That's the way to do it then"
Crag says, "rsync over ssh"
stormagnet says, "when that dead HD was giving us problems"
Crag says, "ah yes"
Crag says, "I think there's a switch you have to give it to tell it to do that on a per-file basis"
Crag says, "Why is Marco always loviest when he's stinky?"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Or is it the other way around?"
stormagnet says, "stink is pry his pheremones"
Crag says, "Maybe"
Crag says, "Smells like butt to me"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "He's very lovey"
stormagnet says, "I want to llloooooooooooove hiiiiiiiiim"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "ok, there's no point in my using the torrent thing"
stormagnet kills it
Crag heh
stormagnet tries scp
Crag says, "If scp or rsync works I'll make a "send to stormy" area for you to pull from"
Crag says, "Grab Lucky Star 01 first, you will love it"
Crag says, "It will make you hungry, though"
stormagnet says, "Oh NOES!"
stormagnet signals the Foodening Alert System
stormagnet says, "it totally works fine"
stormagnet says, "I'm using WinSCP, which takes a lot of the headache out of SCPing files"
Crag says, "Excellent"
Crag says, "I'll make an area for you in /usr/local/avclub later"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "You might have to remind me of which serieses I was recommending"
Crag says, "I know serieses isn't really the plural of series"
Crag says, "it's seriesessesesesesesseseses"
stormagnet says, ""It SHOULD be"
Crag heh
stormagnet loses
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "WinSCP isn't killing my browser, either, which is nice"
stormagnet says, "though over this distance, it's not much faster than torrents :/"
Crag says, "What rate are you getting?"
stormagnet says, "but that's fine as long as it doesn't give you pr0n lag of some kind"
Crag says, "Oh, let me throttle back my current torrent activity..."
stormagnet says, "it's not bad"
Crag says, "I just cut back the donkey from 300/50 to 200/30.  Did it make any difference?"
stormagnet says, "though WinSCP isn't telling me the rate in this`window, just the aount downloaded so far and the ETA"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "oooh, yeah, it did"
Crag says, "It helped?"
stormagnet says, "yup"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "thankee"
Crag says, "I wouldn't have thought I'd be the bottleneck between here and your dorm"
Crag says, "the internet has come a long way"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "mmmmmm.... sweeet, sweet University net"
stormagnet says, "I neeed this anime"
stormagnet says, "it's for my...... research"
Crag says, "I don't have Lucky Star 02 yet or I'd be watching it right now"
Crag says, "totally!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Dialects!  Culture!  Cute girls talking about food!"
stormagnet says, "SWEET"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Does WinSCP let you queue stuff up?"
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "I can copy a bunch at once, and it'll do them in order"
stormagnet says, "I'll see if it has more advanced queing features"
stormagnet says, "It doesn't seem to let me interact with the program while it's copying a file, though, which kind of sucks"
Crag says, "that would be a nice feature"
stormagnet says, "I can run multiple instances, though, which is pretty sweet"
Crag says, "I've created /usr/local/avclub/for-stormy and I'm dropping Potemayo in there"
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
Crag says, "Potemayo rulz"
Crag says, "the series is much too short though :)"
stormagnet says, "we have queing!"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "and auto-resume"
stormagnet says, "oooh- I LIKE this program"
Crag says, "Awesome!"
Crag says, "I'll let you know when Potemayo's done copying..."
Crag says, "Oh, you'll like Battle Programmer Shirase, too"
stormagnet says, "sweet!"
Crag says, "I've been downloading and watching a LOT"
Crag says, "Potemayo's done, so you should go ahead and queue up that whole directory"
Crag says, "I'll start copying BPS next"
Crag says, "oh, I better check disk space on wrack..."
Crag says, "30g.  I remember when that used to be a lot"
Crag says, "should be fine for now though"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "that's about the size of my HD on this laptop"
Crag says, "I thought it was more like 80?"
stormagnet says, "ergo my longing for a USB drive ^_^;;"
Crag says, "yeah, totally"
stormagnet says, "that was my old laptop"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "no, wait"
stormagnet says, "70g"
stormagnet says, "I suck"
Crag says, "Ok, that's more like what I thought :)"
Crag says, "BPS is done copying, so you should queue that up too"
stormagnet says, "how'd I even get that mixed up?"
stormagnet @_@
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Next to go in the stormy folder is Hayate no Gotoku!"
Crag says, "Which I have not watched more than 5 minutes of"
Crag says, "I've been saving it to watch together"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
Crag says, "It's ready to be queued up now too"
Crag says, "That ought to be plenty for now"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "thank you"
stormagnet says, "excellent birthday present :)"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Did you get a package from your mom?"
stormagnet says, "Luck Star one will be done in abouyt half an hour"
stormagnet says, "nope"
stormagnet says, "but she didn't have my address"
stormagnet says, "turns out she'd been trying to email me"
Crag says, "She asked me for your address, which I didn't have either, and I gave her your email"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "only my stormagnet.com address was totally a spam trap, so I didn't see it ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "ah, I thought you were still using that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "well"
stormagnet says, "I keep meaning to try and fix it up"
Crag says, "I led her astray"
stormagnet says, "I saw it today, though, and emailed her back"
Crag says, "She meant to get something to you by today"
stormagnet says, "I kind of thought that $500 they gave me *was* my birthday present ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet blushes
stormagnet says, "I really should get Skypse installed, now that I think of it"
stormagnet says, "er, Skype"
Crag says, "I still don't have a working mike"
Crag says, "mic"
stormagnet says, "at least until we come up with something better"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I mean, I have that big one, but I don't have the adapter to plug it into the computer"
stormagnet says, "doesn't your laptop have one built in?"
Crag says, "For software I'll be using Ekiga Softphone"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, the laptop..."
Crag says, "Hm..."
stormagnet says, "er, mic, that is"
Crag says, "Yeah..."
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "I hate using the laptop when I have a much better computer right here that we spent so much money on :)"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I think there's a Radio Shack near to my normal path to and from work"
Crag says, "I could probably pick up the adapter there tomorrow..."
stormagnet says, "you could gert one of those microphones like I got at radioshack"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "yeah, but if I'm in my underware I won't have anywhere to clip it :)"
stormagnet installs ekiga
stormagnet bwahs
stormagnet says, "you can loop them around your neck and clip it to itself"
stormagnet says, "the cord, that is"
Crag says, "I like the big microphone because it is decent quality and has its own stand"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm gonna try to sleep again now"
Crag says, "I probably won't be up early enough to see you in the morning."
Crag and the cats send lots of affection down the wire.

stormagnet returns, pleasantly drunk
stormagnet says, "the other drunk-ass salarymen in the izakaya were placing bets"

stormagnet says, "even though the place was *tiny*"

stormagnet says, "gimmee!!!!!!!"
stormagnet WANTS
stormagnet says, "I started craving a Taco Del Mar burrito as soon as I hit LAX"
stormagnet says, "and realized that it was on my list of things to do before leaving"
stormagnet says, "that I DIDN'T"
Crag says, "oh noes!"
Crag says, "I almost regret mentioning it"
Crag says, "almost"
Crag says, "The world is once again safe from the burrito menace"
stormagnet says, "I was right in suspecting that they would be freaking impossible to find here"
stormagnet says, "There are mexican restaurants"
stormagnet says, "most of them ridiculous expensive"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but they do not have Mission-Style Burritos"
stormagnet says, "I NEED THE BURRITO TUNNEL"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I want the tunnel to be real"
Crag says, "I want it badly"
stormagnet says, "I am so hoooongreeeeee"
stormagnet says, "again"

Crag says, "heh, no prob"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I don't have school on Saturday anymore"
stormagnet says, "so, um, yay!"
Crag says, "Oh, sweet!"
Crag says, ""Of course, once you can work, you'll probably be tutoring on Saturdays."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I was kind of planning on it"
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "But private tutoring does pay well enough that I shouldn't have to do too much of it"
stormagnet says, "though if I can get the students and time to do more, it would be a good way to help pay airfare"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "though thats starting to feel less and less realistic :("
Crag says, "I think you'll probably enjoy doing it too"
Crag says, "aw"

stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "Don't!"
stormagnet says, "I'll think of something!"
Crag says, "well, we'll see"
Crag says, "I won't do anything rash :)"
stormagnet says, "$1200 for one week just feels like too much, no matter how I look at it"
stormagnet says, "But if I could find a way to offset that somehow"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet ponders
Crag says, "It doesn't make sense to keep Zippo"
Crag says, "We're always going to need a van"
Crag says, "And we don't need two vehicals"
Crag says, "It's sad, but that doesn't change the situation"
Crag says, "I've had a lot of good times with Zippo, and now it's time for him to have good times with someone else"
Crag says, "holding on to him isn't good for any of us"
Crag says, "I don't think I'm going to name any more cars though"
Crag says, "Unless I get a Tesla some day :)"
Crag . o O ( I would name my Tesla 'Electra', of course )

Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I think I'll watch that first episode of Lucky Star while I eat my lunch"

Crag says, "I'm going to start watching episode 2 now"
stormagnet says, "there's more than 21 episodes?!"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeet"
stormagnet says, "the humor style ands pacing reminds me of Azumanga Daioh a little"
stormagnet says, "There's something that the animation reminds me of, but I can't remember what exactly it was"
Crag says, "I was thinking that too"
Crag says, "also the little girls er, ichigo marshamaro?"
Crag says, "Also class 5-3?"
Crag says, "Not sure if I'm remembering those correctly"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "the art style is a little like that"

stormagnet says, "omg I hate opening my eyes under water too"
Crag says, "me too!"
Crag says, "Some aspects of this genre: very short 'skit'-like chunks, mostly cute girl cast, lots of snacks and goofing off"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "I think them looking young in this one is just the art style.  The adults look like high school students so far."
Crag says, "adult women, at least"
Crag says, "How old do you have to be to work in Japan?  Do they have a limit?"
Crag says, "omg this show rulz"

Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "that's awesome"

stormagnet says, "I wish I was partying"
stormagnet says, "I had to go to bed early, because I had to get up early, because I had to go to the hospital AGAIN"
stormagnet says, "and you know what kind of mood THAT leaves me in"
stormagnet says, "rrrrr"
stormagnet has the HATEY
stormagnet says, "and what's worse, one of the office staff went with me, to help avoid any more life-threatening errors"

Crag says, "Heh"
Crag says, "Yeah. me too :)"
Crag says, "I mean glad I'm hanging out"
Crag says, "They didn't stick around long"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "and enjoying yourself!"
Crag says, "But we did talk about you a bunch"
Crag says, "yes, I'm enjoying myself"
Crag says, "It helps that you tell me about enjoying yourself"
Crag says, "I met up with Kia yesterday to talk, and she said Nathan's having a terrible time back east.  When I thought of what that would be like for me if you were having a bad time, I knew I couldn't enjoy myself."
Crag says, "But since things are going well for you I feel like I have to keep up"
Crag says, "we're a team"
Crag says, "Even when we're apart"
Crag says, "Or maybe especially when we're apart?"
Crag says, "going afk to clean cat boxes"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "sorry about the lag"
stormagnet says, "I'm having issues with the takyuubin service"
stormagnet fumes quietly
Crag says, "takyuubin?"
stormagnet says, "delivery"
Crag says, "Ahhh"
stormagnet says, "I thought these things were bad in the US"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "jeebus keerist"
stormagnet says, "wtf was the point in letting my pick a day and a delivery window, and give them my cellphone #"
stormagnet says, "when they were going to COMPLETELY IGNORE all of the above ANYWAY?"
stormagnet has the HATEY
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "and now I get to wait at home for god knows how long, lest I be out when they come calling again"
Crag says, "I guess some things transcend national boundaries"
stormagnet says, "WELCOME TO THE 21ST CENTURY"
stormagnet says, "WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED PACKAGE RECEIVING"
stormagnet says, "PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT?""
stormagnet growls
stormagnet says, "Now I know why convenience stores offer a package receiving service here"
stormagnet says, "wtf"
Crag says, "It would be pretty funny to explain this to a time traveler from 100 years ago"
Crag says, "yeah, we have cell phones, jet plains, companies dedicated to shipping packages around the world in a day..."
Crag says, "but there's still some kinks to work out"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I'm sleepy, heading to bed"
Crag hugs and kisses
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "g'night!"
Crag wakes
Crag heads to work (and pays rent!)
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I couldn't get to wrack from work, but everything looks fine on this end..."
Crag shrugs.
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "It's ok"
stormagnet just overslept.... again....
stormagnet says, "oh- couldn't get to wrack from work"
stormagnet thought you were wondering about wrack because of her idleness, for some reason
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I was a little"
Crag says, "But I was able to get to neptune and back (heh) so I suspected you were sleeping in"

Crag says, "I put the last two Murder Princess episodes in for-stormy."
Crag says, "and a bunch of other stuff"
Crag says, "I'm going to re-download Murder Princess as avis.  mkvs play chunky for me."
stormagnet says, "YAY"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I'm glad I caught you while you were still awake"
Crag says, "The two files in for-stormy are the mkvs, so if those play fine for you, have at 'em"
stormagnet says, "It would have`sucked to miss a whole day"
Crag says, "Me too!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I can't go too long withuot a fix"
Crag HUGS!
stormagnet says, "the welcome party last night was pretty ok :)"
Crag says, "hee"
Crag says, "I wish I could get people to log on, but it seems to be impossible"
stormagnet says, "I have discovered, mucvh to my shock, that Japanese beer tastes good"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "it does?"
stormagnet says, "come ON, people!"
stormagnet says, "it"
stormagnet says, "auigh"
Crag says, "Would I like Japanese bere?"
stormagnet says, "it is very full of hops, and non-sour"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "it's like a mild Guinness"
Crag says, "Is it still bitter?"
stormagnet says, "more yeasty, too"
stormagnet says, "a little, but less so"
Crag says, "I will have to try some"
Crag says, "A little bitter is ok"
stormagnet says, "I was drinking some at the toast to be polite, and was happily surprised"
stormagnet says, "sort of like that beer Jeff made"
Crag says, "I didn't have any"
stormagnet says, "should have"
Crag says, "oh well"
stormagnet says, "I was surprised, it was really good"
stormagnet says, "also, the proof is a bit higher in Japan"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet says, "not a lot for beer, but it cuts down on that sweetness that I despise"
stormagnet says, "Japanese beer is NOT sweet, as far as I've tasted"
Crag says, "heh, they were talking about chicken curry in Lucky Star just now and it got me longing for yours :)"
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet says, "I've been making a lot of curry here"
stormagnet says, "it is teh cheap eats"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "yum!"
stormagnet says, "there's some of that instant curry in the cupboard still :)"
Crag says, "Yeah, but I like when you make it"
Crag says, "I don't think I want to try"
stormagnet says, "AW"
stormagnet says, "it's not the kind you make- it's the kind in a bag that you boil or microwave"
stormagnet says, "pre-made"
stormagnet says, "but I'm still flattered :)"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "I think I will save that for an emergency"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "it just might come down to that"
stormagnet says, "there's a matsuri this weekend"
stormagnet says, "Machiko and yoshito are coming over in a bit for a belated birthday celebration, and I"
stormagnet says, "erm"
stormagnet says, "I'm hoping they'll go with me"
Crag says, "aw :)"
stormagnet says, "Part of why I overslept instead of heading straight over is that none of the other students I talked to a) knew there was a matsuri this weekend, and b) didn't care, anyway"
Crag says, "I'll stay up until they arrive"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of disappointed in my classmates so far :("
Crag says, "d'oh"
stormagnet says, "though some of them seem like they might make good friends :)"
stormagnet says, "but, wtf?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "MATSURI"
Crag says, "You gotta find friends like the girls in Lucky Star and Azamanga Daioh"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "thet's what I'd kind of been hoping for("
stormagnet 
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet :(
Crag heh
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "maybe it was naive of me"
Crag says, "no!"
Crag says, "They are out there"
Crag says, "But they're probably hardest to find in Tokyo, right?"
stormagnet hopes so!
stormagnet says, "probably, yeah..."
stormagnet says, "another thing that surprised me though, (and I guess it serves me right, for having preconceptions on the matter,) is a) how many european exchange students there are, and b) how bad their attitudes are O_O"
stormagnet says, "I'm amazed at how good their English is, though"
stormagnet says, "but, wtf is up with that 'too cool to even remptely consider ever having fun' BS?!"
Crag says, "What kind of bad attitudes do they have?"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "there were a couple I felt like outright slapping at that party last night"
stormagnet says, "When someone throws you a part, and buys you FREE DRINKS AND FOOD"
stormagnet says, "you do NOT insult their music choices"
stormagnet says, "wtf?!"
Crag says, "Spoiled brats?"
stormagnet says, "they (our hosts) were trying so hard to be nice, and all those kids did was ridicule them behind their backs"
stormagnet says, "disgusting!"
Crag says, "That's terrible"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I tried striking up a conversation with a couple, and was just repulsed"
stormagnet says, "There was one French girl I asked if she was joining any clubs, or going to the festival this weekend"
stormagnet says, "as in, 'HINT: I am trying to start a conversation, and see if you are interested in Doing Something Fun'"
stormagnet says, "answered with, 'I came here to LEARN JAPANESE. *I* don;'t have *time* to play around"
Crag!?
stormagnet says, "Then she asked mne which class I was in"
stormagnet says, "I had a little too much fun saying "3B- so playing around really is the best way for me to Learn Japanese right now, since I'll run out of classes to take before I leave ANYWAY"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "Seriously, who the fuck goes on an exchange program, as an ADULT, to JAPAN, without speaking a word of Japanese, and then takes that attitude?!"
Crag says, "poopy people"
stormagnet says, "She said "I don;t speak any Japanese, and I said "Zannen desu ne..." and she said "I SAID I don;t speak any Japanese"
stormagnet says, "wtf?"
stormagnet says, "that's on the list with "Hai" "Iie" and "Arigato""
Crag says, "Sounds like she has issues"
stormagnet says, "and "Sayonara""
stormagnet says, "SERIOUSLY"
stormagnet says, "Except THEY WERE ALL LIKE THAT"
Crag says, "Maybe she doesn't even want to learn Japenese and is there because her parents sent her or something"
stormagnet says, "Not neccessarily with the language ability"
Crag says, "Maybe they're all like that?"
Crag says, "I dunno"
stormagnet says, "but with the seriously stuck-up attitude"
Crag says, "It hardly seems worth figuring out :)"
Crag says, "that's pretty sad"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "They're not doing a very good job of representing the world"
stormagnet says, "but I'm still trying to get over the disappointment"
stormagnet says, "Precisely!"
Crag . o O ( or maybe they are )
stormagnet says, "god, I hope not"
Crag sighs and nods
Crag says, "Sometimes it seems like there's too much to fix"
stormagnet says, "So far, the people I get along with best are, predictably enough, the Japanese students who were hosting the party"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Once I get involved more in clubs and tutoring, I think I'll make more friends that way"
Crag says, "absolutely"
stormagnet hopes so, anyway :)
Crag says, "I'm sure of it"
stormagnet says, "I get sort of a foot-in-the-door, since I awake their Good Samaritan urges"
stormagnet says, "so they start talking to me just to be nice"
Crag says, "I was curious whether your situation would work for or against you"
stormagnet says, "but I think I had genuinly fun conversations with some of them :)"
stormagnet says, "both, kind of"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "I'm still trying to get over how bad the social skills were of the European kids (all together, which was the worst- there didn't seem to be much country distinction on that front) were in comparison"
stormagnet says, "Like, Hint- If you come over and strike up a conversation with me, do not start it with the line- "I felt sorry for you sitting over here all by yourself.""
stormagnet says, "THAT was the IRISH girl"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "what the hell?"
Crag says, "that's pretty bad"
stormagnet says, "When I tried to start a conversation ANYWAY (actually, feeling a little sorry for HER) by saying 'Oh, really I'm half Irish..""
stormagnet says, "she said, "NO. YOU'RE American.""
Crag LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "WHAT THE FUCK?"
stormagnet says, "I mean, DAMN"
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "They sound like gradeschoolers"
stormagnet says, "I could see how it might get on someone's nerves, hearing that all the time, but since she was being so fucking rude, I couldn't think of a much better conversational gambit"
stormagnet says, "seriously!"
stormagnet says, "I haven't met someone that openly bitchy since MIDDLE SCHOOL"
stormagnet says, "and MIDDLE SCHOOL is a step below a pack of rabid HYENAS"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "still, it's a limited sample"
stormagnet says, "absolutely"
stormagnet says, "I just got some unexpected culture shock out of it, I guess"
Crag says, "It could just be that there's something about the exchange programs that selects for bad attitudes or something"
Crag says, "Sure"
stormagnet says, "And there was this one guy from Sweden who seemed really nice"
stormagnet says, "and a research student from England who was at least polite"
Crag says, "The crappy ones would tend to stand out in the crowd"
stormagnet says, "true!"
stormagnet says, "I got a very limited sample, since the place was too crowded and small for me to move around"
stormagnet says, "and, there was a really heartwarming display from the LOCAL culture"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "the students organizing the after party had called ahead to ask if the place had an elevator, so that I could get inside "
stormagnet says, "but the folks answering the phone failed to mention (or perhaps, just didn't know) that there were stairs leading up from the street TO the elevator"
stormagnet says, "and when we got there, I was sitting and looking at the steps and scratching my head, when a cluster of drunken salary men passed by"
stormagnet says, "and scopped up the chair and plunked it at the top of the steps before I even had time to react, and then stuimbled off into the night"
Crag says, "Your electric?!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "HOLY COW"
stormagnet says, "there were about 4 of them"
Crag says, "STILL"
stormagnet says, "they grabbed it palanquin style"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "WOW"
Crag says, "It's not like it has convienient handles"
Crag says, "I'm glad nothing went amiss!"
Crag says, "That could have been a disaster"
stormagnet says, "and some of the Japanese students did the same to get me out again!"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "I'm really happy to hear that :)"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I can worry about you a little less now"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I had heard that in Japan, it was considered a pretty common method of dealing with inaccessible locations"
stormagnet says, "being carried, that is"
stormagnet says, "but I hadn't really considered it, or thought that they meant it for *electrifc* wheelchairs"
Crag says, "I can't imagine that happening here"
stormagnet says, "yeah, seriously!"
stormagnet says, "and I saw a shop with wheelchairs for sale"
stormagnet says, "that were hybrid manual/electric"
stormagnet says, "just like a dream come true!"
stormagnet says, "I might have to bring one home with me ^_^"
Crag says, "totally!"
Crag says, "Leave it to Japan to engineer a good chair"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I wonder what its stats are"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "they look like they might not be very good for long disatances, like this one is"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "but they also look super lightweight"
Crag says, "I'm curious about the drive mechanism"
stormagnet says, "they take a regular folding manual chair"
stormagnet says, "and there's a battery on the back (single battery, by the look of it)"
stormagnet says, "and some kind of small motor that connects to the wheels"
Crag says, "huh"
stormagnet says, "you can control them with a joystick, or you can use them manually"
stormagnet says, "and I think some might have a third option of controlling it manually, but using the motor and batteries for a boost"
Crag says, "Interesting"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I think I can imagine how that might work"
stormagnet says, "On tuesday, I'm going to the City Office to finish m y paperwork"
Crag says, "But still"
Crag says, "For the work permit stuff?"
stormagnet says, "and I'm bringing forms from the hospital that migt get me a discount and other disability benefits :)"
stormagnet says, "that, I don't get to file until the 12th, sadly"
Crag says, "Enjoy your time while you can"
Crag says, "I'm betting you'll be in high demand once word gets out"
stormagnet says, "aw!!"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Your patience and compassion alone make you a good teacher, but your passion for linguistics and insight into the subtlties will make you a genious tutor"
stormagnet hopes so!
Crag says, "You want to understand language aquisition, so you'll be especially sensitive to students' needs"
Crag says, "And that will make learning easier for them and more fun for both you and them"
Crag says, "I think tutoring is going to be the best part of being over there"
stormagnet says, "I hope so :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to register as a conversation partner, too"
stormagnet says, "which will probably be the best way I can make friends :)"
Crag says, "that makes sense"
Crag says, "I think I've decided to get a new monitor first out of all my planned purchases.  The bad monitor cable is driving me batty"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "sounds like a plan"
Crag says, "But I'll have to wait another month at least"
stormagnet doublenods
Crag says, "I still haven't caught up on all the bills and there's only about $500 of buffer left after rent this month"
stormagnet says, "Once we've got some buffer saveed up, I think we should switch banks, too"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "Sancho and Marco are sharing your office chair"
Crag says, "tensely"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "that sounds so cute!"
Crag says, "It's... kinda cute..."
stormagnet says, "I've got to send you this phone right away"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "so you can take pictures"
Crag says, "oh, Marco's done sharing"
stormagnet says, "I keep forgetting"
Crag says, "He got up and Sancho ran off"
Crag says, "it was quick"
stormagnet says, "and kind of wanting to keep using it, 'cause it's SO GOOD"
stormagnet says, "Aw!"
stormagnet says, "At least he didn't go into Snake Cat mode"
Crag says, "He would have if Sancho hadn't been waiting for him to snap"
stormagnet says, "I thought he had when you said he was 'done sharing' :P"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "basically, yeah"
Crag says, "He was pretending to share the whole time"
Crag says, "It was like a showdown in a western"
Crag says, "there was a tubleweed, a clock struck noon, shots rang out :)"
Crag says, "I bet there's a neat haiku in there somewhere"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "they are pretty cute though"
Crag says, "Sancho sat in my lap for a while today, soaking up lovies while I watched anime"
stormagnet says, "AW"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad that they're keeping you such good company"
Crag says, "they're good kitties"
stormagnet is slightly envious
Crag says, "They do their best"
stormagnet giggles
Crag smiles.
Crag says, "Marco always sleeps close to me on the bed"
Crag says, "Sometimes when I'm napping Sancho sleeps in the bookshelves nearby"
Crag says, "Did I tell you about re-arranging the bed and shelves?"
stormagnet says, "no!"
Crag says, "It was the weekend that you left"
stormagnet says, "how'd you do it?"
Crag says, "I turned the bed 90 degrees clockwise"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I moved the shelf on the window side between the bed and the wall"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ANd then a couple weeks ago I moved two of the rolling drawer tower things next to that shelf"
Crag says, "Makes it a lot easier to use the whiteboard"
Crag says, "And to get at underwear and socks"
stormagnet says, "yeah :)"
Crag says, "And I can flop on the bed from the hallway more easily"
Crag says, "But I usually sleep on the wall side"
stormagnet says, "so the bed is between the shelves?"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "that might be easier for me, too"
Crag says, "The shelves that were on my side are in the same place"
Crag says, "The other shelves are between the bed and the wall"
stormagnet says, "though it does raise the 'carwling over each other to get to the bathroom' problem :P"
Crag says, "No, there's room on the inside to get out"
Crag says, "the bed's not against the wall"
stormagnet says, "oh!"
Crag says, "that's the side I sleep on and I get out on that side now"
Crag says, "I only flop on the bed like that if I'm REALLY drunk :)"
Crag says, "The rest of the time I go the long way around"
stormagnet is having a little trouble picturing it
Crag says, "I'll send you pictures when I can"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "Or maybe I'll draw a picture in a drawing program"
Crag says, "or both"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "after you get your monitor, we should also finish paying off the credit card... "
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "or maybe before"
stormagnet says, "I'm hoping to use it just as emergency buffer / cash drop for Japanese transcations"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I looked at the statement.  I had no idea the rate was so high"
stormagnet can't wait to start tutoring :)
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it kept going up, because we kept missing payments / being late"
stormagnet says, "er, by we, I think I mean 'I'"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'm still part of the team :)"
stormagnet double hehs
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet hi5s
Crag hi5s!
Crag says, "I thought rent was due on the 5th"
stormagnet thought so too?
Crag says, "Nope"
Crag says, "4th"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "But the guy let me slide"
Crag says, "I had already written out the check YESTERDAY"
stormagnet says, "but the 5th wasn't a holiday?!"
Crag says, "ANd decided not to go home before partying"
stormagnet is so confused!
Crag says, "It's just due on the 4th always"
Crag says, "I'm glad you're confused too"
Crag says, "I thought it was weird"
stormagnet says, "that's... so not what I remember"
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "I know they don't make exceptions for holidays"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "But I thought the 5th was the regular due date"
Crag shrugs
stormagnet remembers that much
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
stormagnet says, "wtf?"
Crag says, "I mean, MAYBE he was messing with me"
stormagnet hmpphs
Crag says, "But I got really upset, so I think he would have said he was kidding if he was"
Crag says, "I just checked that flier they put out"
stormagnet says, "omfg"
Crag says, "And it says 1st, with a grace period 'till the 4th"
Crag says, "so... oh well"
stormagnet says, "I just logged into my MySpace, after ignoring it forvere"
Crag says, "yeah?"
stormagnet says, "all my ads and interface are in Japanese!"
stormagnet O_O
Crag laughs
Crag says, "probably because of the ip you're coming from"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet is amused
Crag says, "That's kinda neat though"
stormagnet says, "I prefer the Japanese ads anyway :)"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "omg"
Crag?
stormagnet says, "I'm teh bad- I have a lot of unread messages from friends"
stormagnet says, "I should stop being such a snob and just use MySpace more often"
Crag says, "I dunno"
stormagnet says, "Some are so sweet they make me want to cry"
Crag says, "aw"

stormagnet | Reasons why I am grateful you were born on October 2:
stormagnet | I think that you are unique and genuine, and I never saw you stray from the person you are. Also, since sixth grade, I never witnessed you say anything cruel about anyone else, your heart always seems to be is in the right place. And, I know you have had your hardships in your life, and despite that, you didn't allow that to turn you into an asshole.

stormagnet | Granted, I might not know who you are nowadays, but from who I remember from the past, all of this is true. If this note is days too soon, sorry, I'm bad at writing people when I am suppose to and I saw your birthday is coming up.

Crag says, "about what the w's were and stuff"

stormagnet says, "good practice!"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "gu-d!"
stormagnet says, "the w's are for the way their mouths are drawn in doodle-style when laughing"

Crag says, "grr"
Crag says, "and then another call at 8"
Crag says, "At least it's all on the weekend"
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "that is teh suck!"
Crag says, "Oh hey, you're up :)"
Crag says, "They called again at noon"
Crag says, "Three calls in 12 hours.  whee."
Crag says, "But I'm glad I don't have to go to work after sleeping poorly"
Crag says, "My plans with Nicole sorta fell through too"
Crag says, "She ended up having an overnight guest or something"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "She's enjoying her youth, to be sure"
Crag says, "it must be nice"
Crag says, "Gah!  I sound like an anime!"
stormagnet says, "aw........"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "What's in store for your Sunday?"
Crag says, "Heh, I like how in Lucky Star the subbers even gave the teacher's subtitles a country twist ("y'all")"
stormagnet says, "sorry for the hella lag- Machiko and Yoshito stayed over again ^_^;;"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's ok"
stormagnet had CAKE
Crag says, "CAKEY!"
stormagnet says, "I might go to that matsuri later"
stormagnet says, "but it'll have to be by myself, because Machiko and Yoshiyo had plans :/"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You won't be able to dress up for it either"
stormagnet says, "I'm still undecided as to whether it's worth going by myself"
stormagnet says, "it doesn't sound like the yukata-type matsuri"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh that's too bad"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I dunno"
Crag says, "But I bet you could get your aunt and uncle to buy you one before you come back :)"
Crag says, "I'd like to see that"
Crag heee
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I WILL be here during part of the summer, after all...."
stormagnet says, "school doesn't let out until July"
Crag says, "Does that mean you won't actually be back until August?"
Crag says, "Or does it let out early in July?"
stormagnet says, "might...."
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "early July"
Crag says, "I see"
stormagnet says, "my visa is good until August"
stormagnet says, "if you got some vacation time"
Crag says, "you should make the most of your visit"
stormagnet says, "we could go matsuri hopping"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "not that you need me to tell you that"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I'm still kinbda sleepy and lazy feeling now"
stormagnet says, "maybe I'll sleep in a little more, and then decide whether to go to the matsuri"
stormagnet says, "I'm worried that going by myself will just be depressing"
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag hugs
stormagnet says, "but that could equally easily be the sleepiness talking"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet could go with the specific mission of collecting photos to show friends, for instance
Crag says, "Or you could watch lots of Lucky Star instead"
stormagnet says, "Machiko and Yoshito get up way too early"
stormagnet says, "oooh"
stormagnet says, "that too!"
Crag says, "I'm up to episode 13"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "ok then!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet will watch Lucky Star IN BED
Crag says, "AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "best of both worlds!"
Crag says, "And it's like a fourtune cookie"
Crag says, "IN BED"
Crag says, "Does Farmers auto-bill our BofA visa?"
stormagnet says, "yep"
Crag says, "ok, that explains that"
Crag says, "I'm looking pretty good this week then"
Crag says, "I think I'm almost $500 ahead"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "way to go!"
Crag says, "thanks :)"
stormagnet says, "hang on- I'm going to drop net for a sec while I move the laptop to the bed"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "I haven't opened any of your medical bills yet, so I have no idea what that will add up to."
Crag says, "Er, do we have a GameTap subscription?  There's a $26.85 charge."
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "yep"
Crag says, "Are you using it?"
stormagnet says, "that's annual, though, I think"
Crag says, "Oh."
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I was actually going to ask you if you want to pick a game to play together"
stormagnet says, "all those games Konata plays have given me teh Cravey"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "and my homework load is light enough to accomodate it"
Crag says, "I wonder if there's something we could play together online remotely"
stormagnet says, "I have a medical bill tally, it's pretty gruesome"
stormagnet says, "will take a while"
stormagnet says, "but, it also can wait easily"
Crag says, "Also, what's our speakeasy username?"
Crag says, "I want to see if I can get our reverse DNS changed."
stormagnet says, "the leftover utilities from the house are a slightly more pressing concern"
stormagnet says, "the speakeasy username is raine"
stormagnet says, "stormagnet, sadly, does not fit :/"
Crag says, "The two default passwords didn't work."
stormagnet says, "try the really short old one"
Crag says, "that's what I thought it was"
Crag says, "They changed the interface, so maybe the usernames changed too"
Crag says, "As part of the merger and all that crap"
stormagnet says, "then try the longer, higher sedcurity two"
Crag says, "I tried raine@speakeasy.net in case that's what it was"
stormagnet says, "should be just 'raine'"
Crag says, "yeah, I tried 'em both :)"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "all three passwords, total?"
Crag says, "Three?"
Crag checks @who

Total: 2 people, both of whom have been active recently.
Crag says, "I tried redrum and sas46ppfor"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "the other one"
Crag says, "There's... another?"
stormagnet says, "that starts with a 2"
Crag says, "oh right"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "heh, that worked"
Crag says, "I'd forgotten about that one"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "zomg comfy bed"
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "paying speakeasy now"
Crag says, "my headroom for the month is closer to $400. :("
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet says, "I thought we had speakeasy on autobilol"
stormagnet says, "bill"
Crag says, "It's not"
stormagnet says, "oh- new account"
Crag says, "I checked that first"
stormagnet says, "duh"
stormagnet headsmacks
Crag says, "In fact, we had a $20 past due charge"
Crag says, "punks"
stormagnet growls
Crag says, "I think I might switch us to Qwest."
stormagnet says, "cheaper?"
Crag says, "There was a Qwest salesman at the Alley 24 social"
That is not a valid command.
stormagnet says, "faster?"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag says, "Yeah, half price and faster"
stormagnet says, "go for it"
Crag says, "I think I will."
stormagnet says, "we might get a fee, though"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "that would figure"
Crag says, "But it might be worth it anyway, depending on how much the fee is."
stormagnet says, "I think we signed a service plan for a year, or something"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'll look into it"
stormagnet says, "yeah, if it's half price"
stormagnet says, "I really think we got robbed on this plan"
Crag says, "heh, the address they have on file for us is at EBP"
Crag says, "I'll just update that now..."
stormagnet says, "especially since they didn't deliver the speed they promised"
Crag says, "And I'm changing the phone to mine"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "in fact, I think if we really drive that point home, we could get out without a fee"
stormagnet says, "they really have started to go downhill since they expanded"
stormagnet says, "and now with best buy... yeeesh"
Crag says, ""yeah"
Crag says, "This new interface is pretty crappy too"
Crag says, "There also appears to be no way to correct all the contact info"
Crag says, "amazing"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I updated our address loads of times"
stormagnet says, "but on the main page, it always shows the old one"
stormagnet says, "weaaaaak"
Crag says, "it took me like six tries to change the meridian info to the pontius info and to change the phone number and add my email"
Crag says, "so lame"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "wtf"
Crag says, "So what's the deal with the speed.  Were they saying they could do better than 3.0down, 768up?"
Crag says, "Or are they not actually giving us that?"
Crag says, "I think I've come close to 3g down with torrents"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "more like 2.4g"
Crag says, "I guess that's not close"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I probably won't get very far without having their old promise in writing"
Crag says, "I'll just find out what I can do and make the best of it"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I kind of miss having two monitors"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it was great for multitasking like this"
stormagnet says, "watching crap, chatting, doing homework all at once"
Crag says, "Desktop real estate is something that's hard to give up"
stormagnet says, "IN BED"
stormagnet says, "uip"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet says, "yup"
Crag says, "I hate using the laptop because it's only 1024x768"
Crag says, "so tiny"
stormagnet nodnods
Crag says, "And it's not the same having a desktop manager that scrolls windows around to provde more space"
Crag says, "It has to all be visible at once"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Otherwise the overhead of scrolling around makes the extra space pointless"
stormagnet says, "You get it now!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "precisely"
Crag says, "I looked at projectors"
stormagnet says, "I totally van't wait for heads up displays"
Crag says, "The ones that do more than 1024x768 are thousands of dollars"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet bleaaaa
Crag says, "that's the only way to go"
Crag says, "Track the eye and head position"
stormagnet says, "esp with depth of field"
Crag says, "Project a simulated enormous monitor"
stormagnet says, "yesm"
stormagnet says, "mmmmmm"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "augmented reality ftw"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Speaking of augmented reality"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "I think one of the animes I put in for-stormy is about that"
stormagnet says, "oooooh"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, Denno Coil"
Crag says, "Or Dennou, depending on where you look"
Crag says, ""
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm sure you will like it"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I've only seen the first episode so far"
stormagnet says, "the bgm for "
stormagnet says, "erm"
stormagnet says, "for Konata's games"
stormagnet says, "is getting stuck in my head"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "The music that sticks in my head is the conversation music"
stormagnet says, "if we got a bitchin lcd"
stormagnet says, "that we could hqang on the wall"
Crag says, "duh duh duh duhhh DA da, duh duh duh duhhhh DA da, ..."
stormagnet says, "and a tv tuner card and dvd burner for ildana"
stormagnet says, "SO RAD"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "we could plug in the consoles!"
stormagnet says, "and screen cap!"
Crag says, "I'm down for that"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "we're going to get so mich geekier because of this year :P"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet is typing with the laptop on her belly, ergo strange typos
Crag says, "Heh, Martha's calling me from the road again"
stormagnet says, "remind me not to accept rides from her :P"
stormagnet says, "friends don't let friends...."
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "Heh, that was a short call"
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "She just wanted to brag about moving all her stone inventory (to a new location, not yet sold)"
stormagnet is surprised!
Crag says, "She said the roads are freshly wet and possibly slipper so she can't stay on the phone :P"
Crag too
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "ummm......"
Crag says, "She also mentioned again that Thunder broke up with her boyfriend"
stormagnet says, "REMIND ME NOT TO ACCEPT RIDES FROM MARTHA"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "wtf?!"
Crag says, "I don't think you'll need a reminder"
stormagnet says, "thunder had a bf?!"
Crag says, "Briefly and it was just an informal kind of thing"
Crag says, "Sounds like no kissing, just holding hands or something"
Crag says, "And Thunder really wasn't into it"
Crag says, "Was just going along as an experiment?"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "And the guy didn't sound like he was really into it eather"
Crag says, "Either"
stormagnet says, "I have trouble imagining Thunder ever being really 'into' it"
Crag says, "I think maybe someone pushed him into it or something"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "not in the classic teenage sense"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "peer pressure :P"
Crag says, "Kinda"
Crag says, "From the sound of it, Thunder's friends are much more excited about her life than she is"
Crag says, "For that matter, so are her enemies"
Crag says, "and yeah, she has a couple enemies that she knows of"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Or rather, crazy girls who make drama for her"
stormagnet kind of figured it would be like that
stormagnet says, "yup"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet had a couple of those herself
Crag laughs
Crag says, "You two have a lot in common, I think"
Crag says, "With some very obvious differences, of course"
Crag says, "STINK WAVE!"
Crag says, "GACK!"
Crag chokes
Crag opens the only window he can
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "the new place has its.... disadvantages"
Crag says, "OMG"
Crag says, "I get up to deal with the stinkwave and he tries to JACK MY SEAT"
Crag says, "That cat has some nerve!"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "it was a TRAP"
Crag says, "dammit, I have to put on clothes so I don't get cold.  boo"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "ok I'm back"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "But I think I'm going to completely clean the cat boxes tonight or tomorrow"
Crag says, "As in empty out all the re-used litter, clean the boxes in the shower, and put in completely fresh litter."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm working on a Safeway order anyway, so I can just put some more litter on that."
stormagnet says, "it's good to do that every now and then"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "go Crag!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "man"
stormagnet says, "I have no motivation at all today"
stormagnet says, "I just want to lie in bed in my pajamas"
Crag says, "I've been like that for a month"
stormagnet says, "eating snacks and watching Lucky Star"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I've been eating snacks too!"
stormagnet says, "it seems like a waste of my precious Japan time"
Crag says, "Piroulines!"
stormagnet says, "but there you have it :P"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "oooooooooh"
stormagnet craves
Crag tries to push one through and just gums up his keyboard
stormagnet says, "I think I might be feeling a little homesick"
Crag says, "AW!"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "poor keyboard!"
stormagnet appreciates the sediment
Crag laughs
Crag . o O ( sediment? is she stoned? )
Crag giggles
stormagnet says, "it's kind of otaku-ish, but this really is kind of 'going to my happy place'"
stormagnet was attempting to pun on sentiment :P
Crag says, "you succeeded!"
Crag says, "I was trying to keep the pun golfing in play"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "sorry!"
stormagnet says, "I totally dropped the bal!!"
Crag says, "that's ok, it's harder in this medium"
Crag laughs!
stormagnet nodnods
Crag says, "I think you won that round :)"
stormagnet wasn't in it to win....
stormagnet . o O ( coooooookies )
Crag says, "heee"
stormagnet says, "omfg"
stormagnet says, "laughs"
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet laughs!!!
Crag ?
stormagnet says, "is this that same racing game that you like to play?"
Crag says, "No, but it's similar"
stormagnet says, "that they stole footage from?"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "The tracks were too narrow to be a need for speed variant :)"
stormagnet cracks up
Crag says, "this show rules!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "I love how cousin Yui the cop keeps being a bad example and stuff"
stormagnet says, "oh noes, that file wasn't finished yet"
Crag says, "Ack!"
stormagnet eeps!
Crag says, "Which one?"
stormagnet says, "cliffhanger!"
stormagnet says, "6"
Crag says, "noes!"
Crag says, "I'll take a look..."
stormagnet says, "the art style had gone into Shonen mode"
stormagnet says, "it's finished on the server"
Crag says, "Oh I love that part!"
stormagnet says, "I just hadn't finished transferring it"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "In the manga store!"
stormagnet says, "with the techno music"
stormagnet says, "and commentary from the guys watching"
Crag says, "They do that again a few more times in the series :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "HILARIOUS"
Crag says, "totally!"
stormagnet says, "omg sweer"
stormagnet says, "sweet"
Crag grins
stormagnet is looking forward to the repetiotion of this gag
Crag says, "yes, it only gets better"
Crag says, "Silly wikipedia!"
Crag | A group of goldfish is known as a troubling or, to some, a sushi special "B".
Crag says, "It does include a citation, at least"
Crag says, "but really!"
Crag says, "A troubling of goldfish?!"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "goldfish have their problems too!"
Crag lol
stormagnet says, "and, for that matter, I'm pretty sure there's no such thing as goldfish sushi"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure you're right"
stormagnet ponders
Crag says, "Apparently they can get to be 23 inches long though"
Crag says, "So... maybe?"
Crag says, "I guess I should check out that citation"
stormagnet says, "continuity doesn't seem to be much of an issue in Lucky Star...."
stormagnet says, "those big ones aren't goldfish- they're carp!"
stormagnet says, "same family, different species!"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I'm wondering if I could get away with watching #7 while #6 downloads..."
Crag says, "I think so"
stormagnet had the rest properly downloaded...
Crag says, "I say go for it"
stormagnet says, "but the resume didn't seem to work on #6 for some reason"
stormagnet says, "and #6 ONLY"
Crag says, "The citation backs up the troubling but not the sushi thing"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I think that sushi thing might be vandalism :)"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I think so too ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "ore just a poorly thought out attempt at humor on the part of the original author"
stormagnet says, "ore -> or"
stormagnet . o O ( wtf... my typos are punnning! )
Crag heh
Crag says, "Unfortunately, "sushi" is a popular name for a pet fish"
Crag says, "So googling "goldfish sushi" is pointless"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'm going to take out that sushi special B thing on wikipedia"
Crag says, "I think someone was trying to piggy back of the citation for "troubling""
stormagnet has reconnected.
Crag says, "Reconnected?"
stormagnet says, "wtf just happened?!"
Crag says, "Nothing that I know of"
stormagnet says, "my computer went a little weird"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure it was a problem on my end"
Crag says, "oh ok"
Crag says, "You probably missed me saying:"
Crag | Crag says, "I'm going to take out that sushi special B thing on wikipedia"
stormagnet says, "some kind of weird accidental hotkey, or something"
Crag | Crag says, "I think someone was trying to piggy back of the citation for "troubling""
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "go for it!"
Crag says, "Already done"
[stormagnet :cheers!]
stormagnet says, "um"
Crag laughs
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "You're typoing for great justice :)"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "oh god, they keep making fun of more genres"
Crag says, "I can't say any more without spoiling it :)"
Crag says, "But it was funny enough to bring a tear to my eye"
stormagnet says, "oh SWEET"
stormagnet anticipates!
Crag says, "Let me just say ... MK5"
Crag says, "that is all"
stormagnet says, "man, I'm having a hard time resuming incomplete downloads for some reason"
stormagnet says, "hmph"
stormagnet grumbles and pokes
Crag says, "Hm?"
Crag says, "You might not be able to resume partial files?"
Crag says, "I love the recurring themes in this show"
Crag says, "I'm on episode 16 and they threw in another balsamic vinegar at random"
stormagnet LAUGHS!
stormagnet says, "ok, that's it"
stormagnet says, "I'm totally going to the convenience store later for snacks"
stormagnet says, "choco-pan!!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "yay snacks!"
Crag says, "I think I will have another cup of tea!"
Crag says, "and use up the last of the sugar cubes"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "chicken curry!"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "You got to the part that caused me to talk about curry before :)"
stormagnet says, "YOU PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE, STUPID!!"
stormagnet says, "aiiiieee what a waste!"
Crag lol
Crag says, "I thought that too"
Crag says, "I was like, "Even I know that!""
Crag says, "Elegant Sea Urchin?!"
Crag lol
Crag says, "this show is awesome"
Crag says, "Oh god, the forgotten hot tea!  In the show!  They are us!"
Crag says, "It's like standup comedy for geeks"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet must watch quickly, lest she be spoilered[Z!
Crag says, "You know, pointing out the daily obvious stuff in a funny way :)"
Crag says, "heh, that's not much of a spoiler :)"
stormagnet says, "I just screen-capped their bentos :P"
stormagnet says, "for ideas"
stormagnet says, "even the crappy one"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "from the station name, I know where they are!"
stormagnet says, "Saitama!"
stormagnet says, "zomg, the wikipedia page for Kasukabe lists this anime"

stormagnet says, "ok that's it"
stormagnet says, "convenience store"
stormagnet says, "NOW"
Crag says, "Whew!"
Crag says, "Longer call with Nicole than I had with Martha earlier.  Heh."
Crag says, "She got on a rant about free software :)"
Crag says, "I love how completely we've converted her."
Crag says, "She did most of the work, of course."
Crag says, "but still"
Crag reads scroll
Crag says, "I too felt bad for the froggy"
Crag says, "I was hoping it would make a valiant return, but apparently not"
Crag says, "oh man, you're gonna love episode 16!"
Crag . o O [ this show rulz all! ]

Crag grins

stormagnet says, "whoa!"
stormagnet says, "knew it!"
stormagnet says, "so that's miyuki's mom"
Crag ?
stormagnet bets that she and konata's pop end up hitting it off in a weird yet hilarious way
Crag says, "That would be cool"
stormagnet says, "like the classics prof and his wife in Azumanga"
stormagnet says, "watching the inro, I had that impression"
Crag says, "Oh yeah!"
Crag says, "Bloomers!"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "Now THAT was a delayed reaction"
stormagnet applauds
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "Shall I try and get a picture of some, if I can get away with it?"
Crag says, "um..."
Crag says, "within reason?"
stormagnet says, "Being a girl and all- if they're in the background, I can pretend to be taking a picture of myself, or something :P"
Crag says, "I'll gladly accept any and all pictures you send over"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Bloomers, swimsuits, short skirts, whatever"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "you know me"
Crag says, "I like girls"
stormagnet says, "holy crap!!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "is this for real?!"
stormagnet says, "asre there really cake buffets?!"
stormagnet googles
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I knew you'd like that part"
Crag says, "I'm sure it has to be real"
Crag says, "Everything else in the show is"
stormagnet T_T******
stormagnet says, "NIHON BANZAI"
Crag says, "You won't want to come back next summer."

Crag takes a look
stormagnet says, "lookitpurtypikchuressssssssssszzzzzzzzzzzz"
stormagnet jawdrops
stormagnet says, "Oh. MY. GOD."
Crag says, "Is there one near you?"
stormagnet is searching now
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "There's a bunch in Shibuya, which is pretty obvious, I guess"
stormagnet says, "That's pretty close"
stormagnet says, "Ginza is close, too, but everything in Ginza`is hella expensive"
stormagnet says, "WHOA. But so far, the Ginza one is the cheapest!"
stormagnet says, "1260Y for all you can eat and drink in 90 minutes!!!"
Crag says, "WOW"
Crag says, "that's awesome"
stormagnet says, "They might have one of those 'No Foreigners' signs, though"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "oh."
Crag says, "that would be sad"
stormagnet says, "ahehehehehehehehehehehe"
Crag says, "Maybe if you had backup"
Crag says, "If you were like one in a crowd of six or something?"
Crag says, "CAKE CAKE CAKE"
stormagnet says, "Maybe if I got /machiko to go with me....."
Crag says, "Yeah"

Crag grins
Crag says, "I just learned a very useful word in japenese"
Crag says, "fujoshi - rotten girl"
Crag says, "female otaku, I think"
Crag says, "Oh show me, the way, to the next, rotten girl"
stormagnet cracks up
Crag says, "They're doing a thing where they're making fun of their cencorship of product names"
stormagnet says, "for some definitions of useful..... :P"
Crag says, "I love this show"
stormagnet says, "OH YES"
stormagnet says, "that cracks me up"
stormagnet says, "OMG"
Crag?
stormagnet says, "even in the anime they show one of those horrid ticket machines"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "I saw that and thought of you"
stormagnet except at the hospital I was at, you have to STAND IN LINE
stormagnet says, "AND WAIT FOR THE *ACTUAL HUMAN BEING* TO HAND IT TO YOU"
stormagnet says, "WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT?!"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "ok, done now"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "bwah!"
stormagnet says, "this is why I don't bring a book"
stormagnet says, "?!"
Crag heee
stormagnet says, "AND THE SMELL AGAIN"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I love the repetition"
stormagnet says, "and what the hell was that about the afro?!"
Crag lol
Crag says, "I remember that too"
stormagnet says, "OMGBTFBBQ!!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "there's another genre invasion!!"
stormagnet says, "bwah!!"
Crag giggles
Crag . o O ( I love this show! )
stormagnet says, "I can't believe I still haven't found a good bookstore yet ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "It's my fault for being shy about the trains and going places by myself"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I've been here for a month now, I should getit together"
stormagnet says, "for that matter, I had better post tomorrow ^_^;;"
Crag says, "I'm the same way though, and I even speak the language here"
stormagnet says, "as a sort of one-month anniversary"
Crag says, "Yes, you should post on your blog"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "it's not so much the language that's the problem"
Crag says, "I keep thinking about going wandering around, but then I get demotivated because everything costs money"
stormagnet says, "it's the wheelchair"
stormagnet says, "that too"
Crag says, "yeah, there's that"
stormagnet says, "it's so expensive...."
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "more so there than here, I suppose"
stormagnet says, "and it really stinks..."
Crag heh, there's that stink thing again :)
stormagnet says, "yeah, especially when..."
stormagnet says, "balsalmic vcinegar"
Crag lol
Crag says, "I LOVE THAT GAG"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I will start exploring more thoroughly from now on"
stormagnet says, "today was my last hibernation day"
Crag says, "I still need to hybernate this weekend because I'm on call"
Crag says, "But... maybe next weekend..."
Crag says, "maybe I'll come out of my hole"
Crag says, "maybe"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
stormagnet says, "Hee- Haruhi's one of the few that they don't bother censoring ^_^"
Crag says, "Yeah, I think I might have caught that one"
Crag says, "There were a few"
Crag says, "Are you on the komicon episode?"
stormagnet says, "don't know..."
Crag says, "oh.. ok :)"
Crag says, "I'll just keep quiet"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I've been watching a lot of Lucky Star.  I'm near the end of 19 now.  It's all sorta blending together in my mind"
Crag says, "Iw ill probably have Lucky Star dreams"
Crag . o O ( wouldn't that be nice )
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "I need to do a linguistic survey of 2ch"
stormagnet says, "seriously"
Crag says, "What's 2ch?"
stormagnet says, "website"
stormagnet says, "like an enormous sprawling BBS, but in webpage format"
stormagnet says, "where all the otaku hang out"
Crag says, "Ahh"
stormagnet says, "it's were caturday started"
stormagnet says, "and densha otaku"
Crag says, "Oh!"
stormagnet says, "er, otoko"
Crag grins.
stormagnet . o O ( wow- I freudian slipped while TYPING )
stormagnet says, "it also spun off 4ch as it's slighly tamer cousin"
Crag says, "I sorta learned to play the conversation music on the synth"
stormagnet says, "YAY!"
Crag says, "I can't play both hands at the same time for much of it yet"
stormagnet says, "well done!"
Crag says, "And I don't have the end chords figured out yet"
stormagnet .....
Crag says, "But I'm a good quarter of the way into learning the whole song :)"
stormagnet says, "I WANT TO HAVE CLASSMATES OVER FOR SLUMBER PARTIES!!!"
stormagnet sniffles
Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "why am I the only one that wants to play?!"
Crag says, "I want to play"
stormagnet T_T
stormagnet says, "Really?!?!"
Crag says, "I think so?"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs!!
stormagnet says, "We can play lots when I get back, then!!"
Crag says, "ok!"
stormagnet says, "Normally, you're not really into it"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet says, "I thought you didn't like much of anything like that"
Crag says, "We played sometimes before?"
stormagnet nodnods!!
Crag says, "Like staying up watching movies and stuff"
stormagnet says, "Yeah!"
Crag says, "I like that"
stormagnet says, "but also festivals, and amusement parks, and arcades, and shopping and the beach"
stormagnet says, "stuff like that ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "zoo!"
Crag says, "I like the zoo"
stormagnet says, "roadtrips!"
Crag says, "I love roadtrips!"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs some more. :)
Crag says, "I can be a wet blanket sometimes, this I confess"
Crag says, "But you know, things were pretty rough there for a while, there was always something in the way"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "But I do want to have fun"
stormagnet says, "hang in there!"
stormagnet says, "this long-distance thing might be surprisingly good for us"
Crag says, "I think so"
stormagnet says, "let you stockpile some energy, or something"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Being together all the time is a sword with at least two edges. :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "We really work well online- geeky to the core, or something"
Crag says, "it's true"
Crag says, "I don't quite understand it"
stormagnet says, "our IRL lifestyles don't always mesh so well, but our virtual ones match pretty perfectly"
Crag says, "I agree completely"
Crag says, "It makes me a little sad though"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "yeah..."
stormagnet says, "me too"
Crag says, "But I'm really glad we have been together IRL so much"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I don't think you could have had such a good influence on me otherwise"
stormagnet says, "absolutely!!"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Or me you, for that matter"
Crag says, "At least, I like to think I've been a good influence :)"
stormagnet says, "definitely"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag beams
stormagnet says, "I feel like our set just isn't quite complete"
Crag says, "me too"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It's weird"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "not everything fits the generic model"
Crag says, "Finding you was a huge relief because I had been so sure I would never find anyone of your caliber"
stormagnet says, "we're a pretty good example of that"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "But now that we've been together I've found new needs I didn't know I, or we, had"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Needs isn't really the right word"
Crag says, "It's more fuzzy than that"
stormagnet says, "this is why I'm poly"
Crag says, "well yeah"
stormagnet says, "the principals just match reality better"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "if we totally matched eachother, I think that might actually be a BAD thing"
Crag says, "It might at that"
stormagnet says, "because then we'd never try anything new, or let ourselves change"
Crag says, "I can't even imagine"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Different people for different needs"
stormagnet says, "I think a lot of people pidgeonhole themselves to fit their environment"
Crag says, "That's certainly the case"
stormagnet says, "by mixing things up, it's possible to be a better person, maybe"
Crag says, "You see it in physics, nature and whatnot"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "a perfect balance goes nowhere"
Crag says, "A slight imbalance generates interesting patterns which lead to other things"
stormagnet says, "precisely!"
Crag says, "It can still find a dynamic equilibrium without being wild"
Crag says, "And those are the most interesting parts of the spectrum"
stormagnet nods vigorously
Crag grins
Crag says, "Of course, we're just re-hashing several of our standard conversations here"
Crag says, "But it's interesting to note the tie in with relationships"
Crag says, "And it helps me feel more comfortable with our weird fit"
Crag says, "The being more in tune online thing"
stormagnet says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "besides, if you don't rehash things, you lose them"
Crag says, "If I were going to analyze us astrologically I might suppose that our internet personas are based on our mercury signs"
stormagnet says, "memory is like a bigass cron job, or something"
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "And on review, not only are old connections strengthened, but new ones are built up too"
stormagnet says, "you have to constantly redefine it in terms relevant to the immediate situation, and yourself, or else the meaning gets lost"
stormagnet says, "precisely ^_^"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Oh, speaking of Mercury, there's another retro coming up soon, so that'll be a good time for you to take action, spend money and stuff"
stormagnet says, "oh dear"
Crag says, "I think it starts the 12th"
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure telling me to spend money is a good idea :P"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Maybe not literally"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I'll try to make the most of it :)"
Crag says, "Just expect everyone else to be confused"
Crag says, "And you'll be less confused than usual"
stormagnet expects that most of the time, anyway :p
Crag says, "You should be used to the effect by now, it happens about three times a year :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "be a good time to explore the trains"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I petted Marco for you just now."
Crag says, "because he was sitting there being cute."
Crag says, "He says 'nyo'"
stormagnet wibbles
stormagnet . o O ( kuh.... kuh...... ku )
Crag giggles.
stormagnet . o O ( ki~~~~~~~tah~~~~!!! )
Crag says, "cat ball :)"
Crag says, "Not in a bowl, though"
Crag says, "It would have to be a punch bowl or something anyway"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "WOW"
stormagnet says, "he went off!"
Crag?
stormagnet applauds
Crag says, "Oh!  On the Lucky Channel part right?"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet says, "tsundere"
Crag says, "That was a good bit"
stormagnet says, "omg it totally sounds like karaoke"
stormagnet says, "that cracks me up each time"
Crag grins.
Crag . o O ( she hasn't gotten to the second season yet )
stormagnet says, "oy!"
Crag giggles
stormagnet says, "don't get cocky!"
stormagnet says, "I'll catch up!"
Crag says, "I can't help it"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'm totally into it"
Crag says, "I'm devouring these things"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I watch them all the way through without skipping anything"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad!"
Crag says, "And when the subtitles go too fast I go back and pause it"
stormagnet says, "it's really fun to see you getting wrapped up!"
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "It's 'cause it reminds me of being with you"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "aheheheh"
Crag says, "Hm."
stormagnet says, "HEY"
Crag says, "That charachter that they don't censor..."
stormagnet says, "Why they gotta bad mount poor Sebastian?!"
Crag says, "Is she the one from the show where the episodes are out of order?"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Yeah!  I like Sebastian"
Crag says, "Ok, I think there must be some connection with that show and this one"
stormagnet says, "The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi"
Crag says, "That's the one"
stormagnet says, "Everybody called it Haruhi for short"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I won't spoiler you, but there's definitely something going on there :)"
stormagnet says, "wtf?"
Crag says, "sorry!"
stormagnet says, "this is the second time this has happened"
stormagnet says, "suddenly, my back key isn't working"
stormagnet says, "ah- no, nothing you did ^_^;;"
Crag says, "Oh ok"
stormagnet says, "has that ever happened to you, though"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "well, sorta"
stormagnet says, "I'm using gmplayer, but the control thing isn't coming up, either"
Crag says, "If it's unix stuff, it happens when your keymap is wrong because of a termtype thing or something"
stormagnet says, "hmmmmmm"
Crag says, "But on windows... uh"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I dunno"
Crag says, "If it's not a keyboard thing, it could be a resource shortage of some sort"
Crag says, "I mean"
stormagnet says, "space bar is` still working..."
Crag says, "I was thinking backtracking might require more resources because of having to rebuild the images by scanning even farther back to get all the data because of how the compression works"
Crag says, "but that doesn't really make sense"
stormagnet says, "but it's not lagging, just not responding"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if I should reinstall it"
Crag says, "Couldn't hurt"
Crag says, "I don't know why it would make a difference, but these days nothing makes sense anymore"
stormagnet says, "I tried it with output, and it's saying "cannot seek in raw avi streams""
stormagnet says, "but it was working before!"
Crag says, "Sounds like it doesn't think it's a regular file"
Crag says, "That's strange"
Crag says, "And now Marco's interfereing with my typing :)"
stormagnet says, "let him interfere"
stormagnet says, "I haven't updated in a long time anyway"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Heh, he has moved on"
Crag says, "stinky cat"
Crag says, "updates are good sometimes"
Crag says, "they just referenced Densha Otoko and I caught it despite the censorship"
Crag says, "I RULE"
Crag does a dance
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeeeeeet!"
stormagnet says, "you've done well!!"
stormagnet says, "yoku dekitta!"
Crag says, "Thank you, sensei"
stormagnet says, "erai erai!"
stormagnet applauds
Crag giggles
Crag says, "I wonder if I should watch ... one more ..."
Crag says, "I will make tea first, then decide"
stormagnet says, "The answer is always yes"
stormagnet says, "especially as it's a weekend!"
stormagnet says, "watch until you fall asleep!"
stormagnet <- NOT the voice of moderation
Crag says, "The only reason not to watch another would be if I would enjoy it more if I watched it later."
Crag says, "In this case I am in agreement with you"
Crag says, "I watch now"
Crag says, "It's gotten to where when the conversation music comes on I can't pay attention to the subtitles because I'm scruitinizing the notes"
stormagnet says, "ah! it wasn't exiting clean!"
stormagnet says, "and, no matter how many times I told it to load with the new install, it kept using the back up!"
stormagnet says, "no wonder it sucked!"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "I love it when you play along with bg music!"
Crag says, "I sure hope we're not dealing with this kind of crappy software in five years"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "the new, awesome version has been out for awhile"
Crag says, "I will have to record my own rendition of the conversation song for you when I have it figured out"
stormagnet says, "it was my fault for being sloppy and not deleting the backup in the first place"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet will look forward to it!
stormagnet says, "I wonder if GameTap has any love sim games?"
Crag O_O
stormagnet says, "particularly the ones that are from the girl's perspective....?"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I wonder if GameTap's website looks different from a japanese IP?"
Crag says, "Language, games available..."
stormagnet says, "ooohhhh...."
stormagnet says, "good question"
Crag says, "Whenever they joke about sleep on this show I get sleepy!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "updating gametap now!"
Crag grins.
Crag lol, "stinky!"
Crag says, "I love this show"
stormagnet says, "you should install gametap too"
Crag says, "oh yeah"
Crag says, "Uh"
Crag says, "I guess I'll have to use my laptop"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Are you giving me pr0n lag? :)"
stormagnet says, "oprobably"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet says, "I know I'm getting keyboard lag"
stormagnet says, "a lot of this I'm typing blind"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "If you're syncing from wrack, I'm sure that explains everything"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Is our gametap login 'stormagnet'?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's all the usual"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I'm logged in, too, so we'll see if we can use it simultaneously ^_^"
stormagnet says, "hmmm... new MPlayer isn't working for me *at all*"
stormagnet says, "the playback is all weird- the video way too fast, and the dialogue lagging"
Crag hrms
Crag says, "I got logged in"
Crag says, "So if it's fine on your end then we can use it simultaneously"
stormagnet says, "it is!"
stormagnet says, "sweet!"
stormagnet says, "I can't remember how to get it out of fullscreen, though..."
Crag says, "f? or..."
Crag says, "z?"
Crag says, "It's either z for zoom or f for fullscreen, I think"
stormagnet says, "neither is working"
Crag says, "alt-enter?"
Crag says, "That's a windows-standard fullscreen key"
Crag says, "for toggling"
stormagnet says, "ah-hah"
stormagnet says, "found it"
stormagnet says, "there was a thing in the upper right"
stormagnet says, "but I had puTTy on on-top mode"
stormagnet says, "so it was covering it up"
stormagnet says, "but when in full screen, it messes with your resolution, so puTTy wouldn't respond in that form"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "but now it's a-ok!"
Crag says, "weird"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "man, I want a monitor.... "
Crag says, "me too"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if I could get a cable to hook this into the tv?"
Crag says, "Probably?"
stormagnet says, "this tv is pretty old, but I might could find something"
Crag says, "I want two 24" widescreen 1920x1200 6ms LCD flatpanels!"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "and then I will use the old monitor for the laptop. :)"
stormagnet says, "for that price, we almost could!!"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "The price is currently $390"
Crag says, "each"
stormagnet says, "yeah, but if that bargain comes back..."
Crag says, "I'm keeping an eye out"
stormagnet says, "do so!"
stormagnet says, "I'll try and get some money saved up once I start working"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "man, I am reminded anew how many games there are on GameTap that I'm sure you'll LOVE"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I'm installing it on the laptop now"
Crag says, "I fear the laptop will have disappointing performance"
Crag says, "But the alternative is... unthinkable"
stormagnet says, "hmmm....."
stormagnet says, "so you haven;t tried logging in the client at the same time my client is logged in...."
stormagnet says, "that still might not work"
stormagnet says, "but that's ok"
Crag says, "Oh no, just the website"
stormagnet says, "we could trade off, if that was the case"
stormagnet says, "we have a time difference, anyway, after all"
Crag says, "yeah."
stormagnet says, "the best would be the kind that has mixed puzzle/exploring/narrative modes and fighting modes"
stormagnet says, "that would be good for switching off"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Do you think the games save centrally?"
Crag says, "I was assuming not"
stormagnet says, "good question..."
Crag says, "But even so maybe there's a way"
stormagnet says, "we might be able to trade off save files, though"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Heh, Christian and I did that with a game of Sid Mayer's Alpha Centauri."
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "We didn't get too far before we got tired of it though"
stormagnet says, "this Jericho game looks scary"
Crag says, "I think we did maybe 50 turns or something"
stormagnet says, "and well drawn"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Ok, trying to log in to the client now, let's see if it works..."
stormagnet crosses her fingers
Crag says, "It looks like it's working on my end..."
stormagnet says, "oops"
stormagnet says, "it logged me out"
stormagnet says, "but with a courtesy notice"
stormagnet says, "so I think it's expected that you might have one account shared by a family"
Crag says, "ah, ok"
stormagnet says, "but that if you want to be using it simultaneously, you have to get seperate accounts"
stormagnet says, "no shared play"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I have a feeling there are no networked games on there anyway"
stormagnet says, "so something we could switch off on would be ideal"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "since I can't just sit and watch you play ^_^;;"
Crag says, "not this year"
stormagnet nods sadly
Crag says, "I'll leave the task of finding games to you :)"
stormagnet says, "not unless we did something wicked complicated"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "which is more trouble than it's worth"
Crag says, "basically :)"
stormagnet says, "....probably"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "My laptop doesn't meet the requirements for Tomb Raider: Legends"
Crag says, "I think this is going to be a recurring problem"
Crag says, "I'm logging out of the client"
stormagnet says, "weeeeeeaaaak"
Crag says, "BUT"
Crag says, "I may get a new laptop in a few months"
Crag says, "We're in a new fiscal year and DIG's been getting more money from corporate"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I think I better go to bed now"
Crag says, "Oh noes, there's only 24 episodes of Lucky Star"
Crag pouts

Crag says, "I'm downloading the last one now"
Crag says, "I just finished watching 21"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "why do good shows end"
Crag says, "And bad shows go on for years"
Crag says, "I guess there are some exceptions."
Crag says, "but still"
Crag says, "Anyway, I'm sleepy"
Crag says, "I guess the safeway order will have to wait"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "there'll be more good ones"
stormagnet pats
Crag says, "aw"
Crag snuggles

stormagnet says, "AND a night owl"
stormagnet says, "And egging you on"
stormagnet says, "LIKE that was going to happen anyway"
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "man, I thought not having rewind was bad...."
stormagnet says, "now I can't play them at all :/"
stormagnet says, "I'm starting to guess WHY I never updated"
stormagnet O_o
stormagnet says, "maybe I should look into smms...."
stormagnet says, "er, xmms"
stormagnet says, "could you let me know what player you've been using in windows? mine is seriously not working >_<"
stormagnet says, "the last one I attempted screwed my computer up so bad I had to start imputting using the onscreen keyboard"
stormagnet says, "when I try to type normally now, it makesthis ghastlyhi-pitchedclicking sound"
stormagnet says, "hmmm.... looks like FilterKeys got turned on somehow, and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off"
stormagnet says, "at least I can type again"
stormagnet says, "but seriously- wtf?"
stormagnet says, "AH-HAH"
stormagnet says, "MPUI works ok if I tell it to use adaptive interlacing!"
stormagnet says, "now I can fast forward and rewind again!"
stormagnet says, "aheheheheheheheh"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to do it"

stormagnet says, "AND I ONLY EVER GOT TO PLAY 2!!"
stormagnet says, "OMG RAINE CRAQCK AHOY!"
stormagnet says, "man, this thing keeps asking me to confirm the file write every 5 seconds or so"
stormagnet says, "even though there are NO OTHER OPTIONS"
stormagnet says, "and the file is tiny ANYWAY!"
stormagnet says, "OMG"
stormagnet says, "that thing with getting impatient for the ramen"
stormagnet says, "and reading something to pass the time"
stormagnet says, "and not noticing"
stormagnet says, "and letting the noodles get soggy"
stormagnet does that ALL THE TIME
stormagnet says, "oh nooooooes"
stormagnet also found out about Santa at first the same as Miyuki
stormagnet says, "but I had a bit more of a paranoiac/mystical bent"
stormagnet says, "so I stretched my imagination a little harder"
stormagnet says, "tried to believe that it was a sort of spirit possession thing :P"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "NOW I'm at the ComiCon episode"
Crag says, "And I'm awake again because of work"
stormagnet says, "oh noes!"
stormagnet says, "stupid work!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "it's taking me forever to get through the entry story, because there's so many kanji that I don't know..."
stormagnet says, "but my suspicion is confirmed"
stormagnet says, "this game is going to be a) AWESOME RAINE CRACK"
stormagnet says, "and b) really, really good language practice"
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "neato"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "I'm having fun already ^_^"
Crag says, "I moved the last two Lucky Star episodes into for-stormy *snif snif*"
stormagnet says, "aw!!!!!!!"
stormagnet hugs!!!!!
stormagnet says, "I'm sure the same people will make another awesome series soon!!"
Crag says, "grr, have to escalate to engineering"
Crag says, "that's never good"
stormagnet says, "omg!!"
stormagnet says, "I thought you'd gone back to bed!"
Crag says, "hah, I wish"
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag says, "I've been working on this thing the whole time"
Crag hugs
stormagnet says, "poor roberty!!!"
Crag says, "this is why they pay me the big bugs"
Crag says, "bucks"
Crag . o O ( I get paid in big bugs, like tarantulas and coconut crabs )
stormagnet says, "ooooh.... crabs....."
stormagnet . o O ( dammit wanna eat crab now )
Crag | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab
Crag says, "FRICKIN HUGE"
Crag says, "AND LAND-BASED"
Crag says, "OPENS COCONUTS WITH IT'S PINCERS"
Crag says, "Why does nature create these monstrosities?!"
Crag says, "And what kind of lunatic takes one as a pet."
Crag says, "bleah"
Crag calls next engineer on the list
stormagnet says, "aw, when you put it that way...."
stormagnet says, "I don;t want to eat it anymore"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet :(
stormagnet . o O ( wanna pet it )
Crag says, "PET IT?!"
Crag says, "The coconut crab?"
Crag says, "Did you look at the pictures?"
Crag says, "so scary"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "messing with you"
Crag says, "oh ok"
Crag . o O ( whew! )
stormagnet says, "check out the Japanese Spider Crab!"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "I did"
Crag says, "That's pretty crazy"
Crag says, "I think the picture is rendered, though."
Crag says, "Still, maybe it's no surprise that Japan is the first point of attack of all monsters"
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Since all the craziest animals are in Austrailia and off the coast of japan"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "I had eaten it before, too O_O"
stormagnet says, "hard to believe"
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure I'm down with eating something that can live to be 100 years old"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "dammit..... why are these awesome things that I feel such natural awe and respect for SO. DAMN. TASTY.?!"
stormagnet says, "I'm giving it up with octopus when I come back"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "but I'm having to let my standards slide while I'm here"
stormagnet says, "if only because it's so damn hard to screen ingrediants"
Crag says, "When you put it that way it makes me wonder if it goes the other way"
Crag says, "Maybe humans are delicious!"
stormagnet says, "I'm getting a little more tolerant of pork extract, simply by virtue of it being in EVERYTHING"
Crag says, "Time to call another engineer"
stormagnet says, "I had to stop heaving sooner or later..."
stormagnet says, "omg"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "damn boy"
Crag says, "Nobody's returning my calls"
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag hugs
stormagnet says, "fuck those fuckers!"
Crag says, "right in the ear!"
Crag says, "no answer."
Crag says, "Left a message, but I'm not confident that the fourth one will call me"
Crag says, "Only one more left"
Crag says, "Then I call Phil and make him deal with it"
stormagnet says, "then you'll have done all you could do"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "and sleeeeep!"
Crag says, "for great justice"
stormagnet says, "don't forget to bill the bejeebus out of them, ok?"
stormagnet says, "sleep is expensive!"
Crag says, "Oh yeah"
stormagnet says, "priceless, really"
Crag says, "You better believe it"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I need my beauty rest"
Crag says, "They're sabotaging my modeling career"
Crag says, "Also, all that's wrong is that a payment/refund mechanism is jammed because of a network blip"
Crag says, "The service lost its db connection and needs to be restarted, but there's special handling if things are in a certain state"
Crag says, "Oh here's a call"
stormagnet says, "yay?"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "He's going to call some people and have somebody get back to me... by midnight."
Crag says, "This is one of the parts of the job I really hate"
Crag says, "I'm going to go try to sleep now, even though somebody will PROBABLY call me in an hour or two, just when I'm starting to get that good sleep"
Crag says, "Because if I wait... they won't call."
Crag says, "HATE"
Crag snuggles and snoozes
Crag says, "I KNEW IT"
Crag says, "I hadn't actually gotten to sleep yet"
Crag says, "and they call me"
Crag says, "And then"
Crag says, "They say "I'll just get online and take a look...""
Crag says, "YES, DO THAT"
Crag HATEY
Crag says, "No point in going back to bed now I guess"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "punks"
stormagnet says, "you can sleep later, right?"
Crag says, "if they stop calling me"
stormagnet hugs!!
stormagnet says, "do you have enough tea?"
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "you could go grab a mocha while you wait for them to 'take a look'"
Crag says, "I have tea, but the only sugar I have now is that japanese rock sugar"
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "But I don't want to get dressed either :)"
stormagnet says, "that IS a problem....."
Crag says, "And if I'm outside when they call back I'll have to run back"
Crag says, "what a pain"
Crag says, "On call isn't usually like this"
Crag says, "I'm going to take Marco to work and have him bite all the responsible parties"
Crag says, "SNAKE CAT KNOWS IT WAS YOU"
Crag says, "Oh well, might as well watch some anime"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "you should totally take Marco to work..."
stormagnet says, "if it wouldn't freak him out"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "he'd pry hide"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I'm sure taking Marco anywhere is impossible"
stormagnet says, "it's pretty fun to picture, though"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "somebody goes to open a cupboard in the breakroom...."
stormagnet says, "OMG SNAKE CAT"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "SWIPE BAT BAT"
Crag says, "SNAKE CAT ... ON A PLANE!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I'm gonna lie down.  Maybe the guy will call me back and tell me it's fixed then or something."
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "sounds like an excellent idea"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "and I'm back again (and on the phone)"
stormagnet says, "oh. my. god"
stormagnet says, "they won't let up!"
stormagnet says, "I can't believe I'M still awake!!"
stormagnet is kind of hooked on this game.....
Crag says, "yay hooked!"
Crag says, "ANd now I'm waiting for a call back in 10 minutes or so"
Crag says, "At least the engineer is as unhappy with the software as I am"
Crag says, "That kinda helps"
Crag says, "by the time this is over it'll be four hours since I was first called"
Crag says, "good times"
Crag says, "I bet you're making a nice princess"
Crag says, "I bet she's hawt"
Crag . o O [ like that hawt girl ]
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "she just got elevated to the next magic class ^_^"
Crag says, "Heh, Wikipedia has an entry for Princess Maker :)"
Crag reads up
Crag says, "According to Wikipedia there's a Princess Maker 5 too"
stormagnet says, "OMG"
stormagnet *heart*
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I wonder if I could get that on my phone......"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "It wouldn't even have occurred to me"
stormagnet says, "I just saw it on the list..."
stormagnet says, "and games are built into the menu ^_^"
Crag says, "That's quite a phone"
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I wonder if this version of Princess AMaker has a cheat code, too....."
Crag says, "haha"
stormagnet . o O ( I had fun spoiling the kid the last time I used that :P )
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Do they turn into brats when you do that?"
stormagnet says, "Sometimes"
stormagnet says, "There are different ways to go"
stormagnet says, "the cheat code gives you infinite money"
stormagnet says, "which opens up a LOT more possibilities"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "aw, crap"
stormagnet says, "I glanced at the Wikipedia  page, and saw that there's no adventure mode in this one :/"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "what the hell?"
Crag says, "Seriously.  Girls need adventures!"
stormagnet says, "totally!"
stormagnet says, "plus, that was the only real way to make money in the last game without cheating"
stormagnet says, "and it's really hard to progress the plot without money"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I'm going to bed again now"
stormagnet says, "me too"
stormagnet idles: cuddles
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "konata's cousin"
stormagnet says, "take the two of them and glom them together, so that you have a shy little kid who's extremely geeky on the inside because she spent all that time stuck at home being sick playing games, watching anime, and reading comics and fantasy/scifi novels "
stormagnet says, "and you have middle school me in a nutshell"
stormagnet says, "OMFG what is with these endings?!?"
stormagnet says, "That was the Haruhi end theme!!!"
stormagnet dies
stormagnet O_O
[stormagnet omg]
[stormagnet 3-B?]
[stormagnet ....that's the same class as me]
stormagnet says, "oh noes!"
stormagnet says, "my nemisis showed up!"
stormagnet says, "TALLER THAN ME MAN!!!"
stormagnet says, "Ok, I've never heard of MK5"
stormagnet says, "But I could totally recognize the genre atmosphere"
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "HOW CAN SOMETHING STINK THROUGH A COMPUTER?!"
stormagnet says, "TEA!!!!!!"
stormagnet bwahs
stormagnet says, "I also have to admit...."
stormagnet says, "if there were cosplay cafes in Seattle when I was in highschool, I totally would have worked in one"
stormagnet cracks up at the cosplay cafe
stormagnet says, "daaaaamn, though"
stormagnet says, "800Y for an ho8ur of all you can eat, drink, and play?!"
stormagnet says, "that would be a good bargain ANYWHERE"
stormagnet says, "........."
stormagnet says, "too bad they all seem to be hidden away either at the top or bottom of staircases..."
stormagnet says, "all the ones I've seen, anyway"
stormagnet says, "and I suspect this might be a general characteristic"
stormagnet says, "if it was easy to access, it wouldn't exactly have much privacy"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
stormagnet says, "I think I just got a pretty good idea of what kind of job it was that Keio took their board down over"
stormagnet ^_^;;;
stormagnet says, "I had heard a rumor that exchange students were in pretty high demand for.... 'suspicious' jobs"
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "I totally know what she means about sweets and studying...."
stormagnet says, "Normally I go for salty over sweet"
stormagnet says, "But when I'm studying, I always want the sweet instead of the salty...."
stormagnet says, "what the hell is with that?"
stormagnet . o O ( it's not healthy... )
stormagnet . o O ( I need the salt )
stormagnet . o O ( .... )
stormagnet . o O ( and it's a lot harder to find cheap, vaguely nutritious sweet snacks than salty )
stormagnet . o O ( ...... )
stormagnet . o O ( I'm definitely gonna gain weight in Japan )
stormagnet . o O ( I'll have to get a shoehorn for my wheelchair )
stormagnet says, "my god"
stormagnet says, "that is, like, the fourth time *this week* I've heard something about foreigners being more informed about Japan than natives"
stormagnet says, "three times, I heard it on TV"
stormagnet says, "the fourth time, it was a kind of tsukomi from Machiko after I was expressing my extreme confusion about how a certain game show question could possibly even be a challenge"
stormagnet says, "I was very, very consternated that not only was it a dead simple question, but the contestants ALL got it wrong...."
stormagnet says, "I mean, Murasaki Shikibu is on the 5000Y *bill*, for fuck's sake"
stormagnet says, "...but then again, I shouldn't be too surprised..."
stormagnet says, "I've discovered, much to my chagrin, that most people don't even know about Fukuzawa Yuukichi"
stormagnet says, "and *he's* on the 1000Y bill"
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet says, "10000Y"
stormagnet says, "in addition to being a personal hero and all"
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "anyway"
stormagnet says, "I also find it hilarious how hard they make students study random useless English proverbs and idioms that no one actually uses"
stormagnet says, "this being because of the Confuciamn tradition, where knowing that shit was considered the measure of how educated you were"
stormagnet says, "...still kind of is"
stormagnet says, "but then I should talk"
stormagnet says, "a bunch of the Japanese proverbs and idioms I learned turned out to be really obscure, too"
stormagnet ;_;
stormagnet says, "ok, I've come to the conclusion that the voices and in jokes are not the only things that this series shares with the Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi"
stormagnet says, "I think a LOT of the same production people went into it"
stormagnet says, "Like, they wanted to try something a little lighter and funnier, since Haruhi was kind of dark"
Crag says, "Did you notice the male customer in the cosplay cafe who looked like the guy from Haruhi?"
Crag says, "And that the waitress he was talking to looked like the quiet guy from Haruhi?"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "There's one more REALLY blatant Haruhi reference coming up. :)"
Crag says, "Which was what led to my previous comment."
stormagnet says, "oh yeah, I was past that point when I commented"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "good morning!"
stormagnet says, "one reference I *don't* get is that book Kagami had Konata read"
stormagnet says, "no clue"
stormagnet says, "I'm a bit disturbed to find that I meet Konata's definition of 'core', though"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure she'd turn it around in a heartbeat when she heard that I don't collect, though :P"
stormagnet says, "when younger-twin-whose-name-i-suddenly-forgot asked her what moe was, and she said "when you put it that way...""
stormagnet says, "I expected her to just leave it like that"
stormagnet says, "the joke being that the way she asked that question was, itself, pretty moe"
stormagnet says, "ok, I vaguely recognized the characters running past in the background, but I don't think I've seen whatever it is that they're from"
stormagnet says, "heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuf"
stormagnet dies
stormagnet says, "the pervy friend"
stormagnet says, "getting busted just as she was about to start sketching a doujin"
stormagnet almost choked
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet says, "damn, blondie is like a guidebook"
stormagnet starts taking notes
stormagnet says, "I've been kind of scared to try Akihabara"
stormagnet says, "But Otome Road might be ok"
stormagnet says, "AH"
stormagnet says, "that's where you picked up that word"
stormagnet says, "I couldn't find it in WWJDICT"
stormagnet says, "even though it's usually pretty good at slang"
stormagnet says, "since it's basically open source"
stormagnet says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "I was spelling it wrong!"
stormagnet it was in WWWJDIC!
stormagnet (sl) a girl who is very enthusiastic about comics featuring male homoeroticism
stormagnet says, "ummmm......"
stormagnet says, "maybe not"
stormagnet says, "maybe I'll try Akihabara after I've gotten some steady work"
stormagnet says, "and can afford to start thinking about getting a camera"
stormagnet says, "one that DOESN'T have that irritating anti-panty-shot alert sound everytime you use it, EVEN in silent mode grrr...."
stormagnet says, "I found out that's why I can't turn that off"
stormagnet says, "it's only phones in Japan"
stormagnet says, "which is why my Chocolate didn't make that stupid noise"
stormagnet says, "but it makes taking pictures discreetly in-fucking-possible"
stormagnet says, "and there are perfectly non-perverted reasons to want to take photos quietly!"
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "these a-capella videos are killing me"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "like I said"
stormagnet says, "I gather exchange students"
stormagnet says, "are in PARTICULARLY high demand"
stormagnet says, "for certain...."
stormagnet says, "suspicious employers....."
stormagnet says, "or something"
stormagnet, even if not in a wheelchair, would not be able to take advantage of such lucrative offers, however, as it would be grounds for getting her ass thrown out of the program
stormagnet ^_^;;;
stormagnet says, "ok, seriously didn't get that last reference, to the omiyage"
stormagnet says, "pry for the best"
stormagnet says, "It's the reverse that worries me...."
stormagnet says, "like, should I really know what they're talking about here....."
stormagnet . o O ( ..... )
stormagnet says, "...."
[stormagnet .....]
stormagnet . o O ( there's just no good answer to that question, is there )
stormagnet says, "THE TAKYYUBIN"
stormagnet says, "THAT I WAS RANTING ABOUT EARLIER"
stormagnet says, "I SEE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS THESE PROBLEMS"
stormagnet says, "wtf, Japan?!"
stormagnet says, "if you would just CALL FIRST, and SCHEDULE"
stormagnet says, "or maybe even JUST LEAVE THE DAMN PACKAGE IN THE ENTRY"
stormagnet says, "it would AT LEAST save the gas of driving the package there and back TWICE"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "I love the music that plays in the background when that doujin girl is on a role"
stormagnet says, "I don't know why, but that combination is just completely hilarious"
stormagnet says, "it's like, it feels like a nonsequitor at first, but then not quite..."
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "I thought that was to save her glasses just now"
stormagnet says, "guess that wouldn't have been as funny..."
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "ok, that's another one that, when they put it that way, I kind of which I *didn't* get"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "and that one"
stormagnet says, "but they AREN'T all alike"
stormagnet says, "and lead is super fickle!"
stormagnet says, "like, it'll be the same variety and same brand"
stormagnet says, "but one will be just a little too dry and brittle, or another just a little to greasy, or one will have an uneven texture"
stormagnet says, "and the grip wears in nicely on a good one, while new ones are too slick, so holding them feels weird for awhile"
stormagnet says, "and the width of the bit that holds the lead can affect your view when doing fine details..."
stormagnet snorts
stormagnet says, "oh dear"
stormagnet says, "ok, because of the end bits"
stormagnet says, "I have to say"
stormagnet says, "in my head"
stormagnet says, "you're totally Minoru"
stormagnet says, "oh damn wtf I need to go to bed why am I still awake watching this ack"
stormagnet idles: craaaaaaaaaaap I'm not going to get any sleeeeeeep
Crag . o O ( Minoru? )
stormagnet says, "the male half of Lucky Star"
stormagnet says, "and the guy who does those a-capella end bits"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "THe guy who is sebastian in the regular show"
Crag says, "I'm that guy?"
Crag says, "So, funny story.  I was having problems playing .mkv files, but I tried the same files in mplayer (in ubuntu) and they work perfectly."
Crag says, "I don't know what the deal is there"
Crag says, "BOOOO!"
Crag says, "I broke the handle on the Master Ninja mug :("
Crag says, "It broke into three major pieces and lots of chips.  I don't think it's repairable"
Crag says, "I threw out the handle pieces, but I'm going to keep the mug part around and not use it anymore"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "The situation reminds me of when Nana broke the strawberry glass."
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "but you rescued the rest!"
stormagnet says, "drinking from it Japanese style would be more appropriate, anyway!"
stormagnet still hasn't watched the last couple episodes of Nana
stormagnet just got home from the city office
stormagnet says, "apparantly, the doc evaluated me at a Level Two disability"
stormagnet says, "that's pretty hardcore- if my application is approved, I'm eligible for some kind of crazy benefits"
stormagnet says, "like, all my medicine for FREE"
stormagnet says, "and, um, MONEY"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "I haven't watched the last three Nana either"
Crag says, "Hooray for disability, I guess?"
stormagnet says, "I'm in too much suspense"
stormagnet says, "almost afraid to watch them"
Crag says, "yeah, me too"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I'm afraid it's going to end badly"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And I have so much other anime to watch"
Crag says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I started watching the combat butler"
Crag says, "good stuff"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "very silly"
Crag says, "Also, Baccano! looks interesting"
Crag says, "The first eight episodes are in for-stormy"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "I will get started as soon as I finish Luck Star"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'm highly de-motivated to sleep"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I have no meetings tomorrow"
Crag says, "Jennifer doesn't care if I'm in by 10, and pointed out that she's been getting in late too"
Crag says, "Said she hadn't even noticed when I was coming in"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "And work is incredibly boring and stupid"
Crag says, "ugh, the new manager of the mail engineering team, Jennifer's old team... he drives me nuts"
Crag says, "He takes forever to get to the point, if he ever does at all"
Crag says, "And his points are stupid"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "He's passively insulting"
stormagnet knows the type
Crag says, "He's ill-informed"
Crag says, "hate hate hate"
Crag says, "Patronizing.  That's the word I was looking for."
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "But not overtly so"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "my button"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You would probably kill this guy on sight"
Crag says, "At first I thought I was having racist feelings (he's of some sort of middle-eastern descent I guess)."
stormagnet says, "probably"
Crag says, "But now I think he's just an ass"
stormagnet says, "NO"
Crag says, "No?"
stormagnet says, "just ask Nicole"
stormagnet says, "she knows what that's like"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Oh, heh lag confused me"
Crag says, "You were saying "probably would kill him on sight" and "no you're not being racist""
stormagnet says, "being patronizing is a character trait endemic to middle eastern cultures "
Crag says, "Ohhhh"
stormagnet says, "well, both"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I might kill him without even having to look at him"
Crag says, "I think so"
stormagnet uses her MIND.... at a DISTANCE
Crag says, "He doesn't have any major accent, so just hearing him talk in his plodding, round-about way should be enough to set you off"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "I feel like clenching my fists whenever he's around or on an email thread"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it might be that in his culture it's not considered offensive"
Crag says, "Maybe"
stormagnet says, "but if he's going to do well here, he needs to LEARN how incredibly fucking rude he's being"
Crag says, "I suspect (wishful thinking?) that he annoys Jennifer too"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "oh, I bet he does"
stormagnet says, "you might bring it up in a round about way"
Crag says, "He kept bring the conversation back around to the same nothing"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "I'm thinking about mentioning it in my next one-on-one"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "If it keeps up like this it's going to be a  Problem"
Crag says, "I just wanted to say, "what are you trying to accomplish with this thing you're talking about?""
Crag says, "But I knew what I would get"
Crag says, "gibberish"
Crag says, "For example"
Crag says, "Jennifer said she didn't think there was a problem, and Bipin said he wanted to address this before it became a problem"
Crag says, "Sounds good at first"
Crag says, "Except - he hasn't defined the problem that we don't even have"
stormagnet says, "uh-huh"
Crag says, "He was trying to push some kind of formal communication standard"
Crag says, "Which is the kind of thing I love"
stormagnet says, "except...."
stormagnet waits for it
Crag says, "But he never said what was being communicated to whom or whatever"
Crag says, "I mean"
Crag says, "He asked us who the audience for this communication would be"
Crag says, "We don't know what the communication is!"
stormagnet says, "eeewwwwwww"
Crag says, "We asked him who would send it, and he said he'd leave that up to us"
stormagnet says, "uh-HUH"
Crag says, "And for the content, just answers to five questions which neither he nor TJ could remember"
Crag says, "TJ sent email later listing the questions (what, why, how, test, rollback)"
Crag says, "We already have a change communication standard"
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "We asked him how what he was proposing differed, and of course he had no idea because he doesn't know what our current standard is"
Crag says, "because he's new"
Crag breaths
stormagnet says, "somebody who starts shit over nothing because they figure it's a shortcut to sounding important and lie you know what's going on"
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet says, "which, unfortunately, a lot of the time is true"
Crag says, "He thought he had an easy victory he could get in right away"
Crag says, "But he's tilting and windmills :)"
Crag says, "I've always wanted to use that expression"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "And as you know, TJ is my least favorite programmer on that team"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "And the sanest one, Polina, wasn't in the meeting"
Crag says, "It was a terrible meeting"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "hang in there"
Crag says, "I kept looking at my phone, trying to make it seem like we were running long :)"
stormagnet says, "you should seariously get some nice sane peeps together and road trip to the nearest hot spring, stat"
Crag says, "that sounds nice"
stormagnet hugs
Crag says, "I think Marco's hungry, he's making eyes at me"
stormagnet says, "nicole and zoe and clayton all seem like they'd be good to go"

stormagnet melts

Crag says, "oh well"
Crag grins.

stormagnet says, "worth of stuff to send"
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "Er, when are you going to need me to send you stuff?"
Crag says, "Is there something I need to be doing soon?"
Crag says, "I have no clue :)"
stormagnet says, "not really"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "I snuck in more than one months supply on most of my meds :P"
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet says, "they were dirt cheap ones, and shipping is so expensive, I though, 'fuckit- if I'm busted, I'll claim ignorance and toss 'em'"
stormagnet says, "ahehe"
stormagnet didn't get busted
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "as well you know- I wrote about what Customs was like"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "You should post more!"

Crag says, "Of course, I love all your writing"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "I will"
Crag hugs!!
Crag says, "I have a pillow I hug when I sleep now"
Crag says, "I might have to get one of those body pillows"
stormagnet says, "me too!"
stormagnet says, "as in, hugging, and as in, craving a bigger one!"
Crag says, "You could get one with an anime girl on it :)"
Crag says, "I'mma feed the kitties :)"

stormagnet <- still watching lucky star
Crag says, "haha"
Crag says, "That part reminded me of Chet"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "He bragged about exploding mosquitoes by contracting his muscles"
Crag says, "I never saw him do it though"
stormagnet says, "I've done it before"
stormagnet says, "it's not actually very hard"
stormagnet says, "but in my case, the bite bled like crazy after I exploded it, so I figured that I really, really shouldn't do that anymore"
stormagnet says, "besides, it STILL ITCHES"
stormagnet did it on a dare
Crag says, "ever the zebra"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "ok, whatever those games are that Konata is playing, I WANT"
Crag grins.

Crag laughs
Crag says, "Hm, I wonder who you would want on your pillow..."
Crag says, "Sakaki?"
stormagnet says, "......."
Crag says, "Um... I can't remember her name, but maybe Cardcaptor Sakura's friend?"
stormagnet says, "....I don't even know"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "Tomoe"
stormagnet says, "ummmmm"
stormagnet says, "Chiyo-chan, probably"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I always want to hug her!!"
Crag says, "so cute"
stormagnet says, "but if I went to go buy something like that, it would definitely be in a LoliCon section"
stormagnet ;_;
stormagnet <- scared
Crag giggles
stormagnet says, "IT STINKS FOR A WHOLE YEAR?"
stormagnet says, "HOW CAN THEY SPEAK SO LIGHTLY OF WHAT MUST BE STENCH INCARNATE?"
Crag laughs!
Crag . o O ( balsamic vinegar )
stormagnet says, "yeah, but I actually HAVE eaten balsalmic vinegar sandwiches"
stormagnet says, "like caprese sandwiches, or roasted vegetable sandwiches"
Crag says, "Maybe it's a light stink"
Crag says, "For a whole year"
Crag says, "whatever it is"
stormagnet doubts it!
stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet says, "it even had 'balsalmic' written on her fan!"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "That cracked me up!"
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet says, "I don;t know what that reference to dogs and crows was, but I suspect it was some other anime with the same voice actors"
Crag says, "probably"
Crag says, "The show seems to be one long stream of references"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm gonna head off to bed now"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "sleep well!"
Crag says, "thank you"
Crag says, "I slept almost 12 hours last night :)"
Crag says, "can't do that tonight though"

stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "omg, that falling asleep at the desk thing"
stormagnet says, "and hitting your elbow"
stormagnet says, "I do that all the damn time, dammit"
stormagnet says, "sometimes it slips, and the edge of the desk catches me right in the funny bone"
stormagnet says, "NOT FUNNY"
stormagnet says, "also, this is why I have been known to actually GET OUT OUT OF THE BATH to write things down"
stormagnet says, "and why I used to keep writing supplies in that cupboard over the toilet"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "and by the bed"
stormagnet says, "I've heard those deer are scary"
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "but I want to go feed them anyway"

stormagnet says, "WAS THAT THE STINK?"

stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "I bet it was"
stormagnet says, "NOES SERVER MAINTENANCE"
stormagnet says, "she was all raring to go, too!"

stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "he exploded"
Crag wakes
Crag says, "heh"

Crag says, "The 1600x1200 ones start at $240"
Crag says, "I'd still have to wait a month"
Crag says, "at least"
Crag <- back home
Crag says, "Heh.  My safeway.com order arrived.  They were out of stock for the stuff I put on to pad the order (cider, vitamin water, frozen burritos)."
Crag says, "And I still got the discount delivery price anyway"
Crag says, "And if I'm reading this right, they under-charged me for the cat food too"
Crag says, "I can't tell what I originally ordered, but they delivered 40 cans and the bill says 30 cans."
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "bwah"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm heating up lasagna"
stormagnet says, "sometimes their bungles work out for teh win"
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
stormagnet gives 3 cheers for lasagna
Crag says, "yeah, but if it hadn't worked out in my favor, I wonder how I would have gotten satisfaction"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "It's possible to skew things in your favour"
stormagnet says, "especially by padding the order with things you want, but that we know they're always out of"
stormagnet says, "ie. vitamin water and cider"
stormagnet says, "and if they charge you for aomething they don't bring"
stormagnet says, "a) be careful to count before signing the slip, even tho it's a pain in the ass"
stormagnet says, "and b) complain"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "Yeah, next time I will definitely count before signing"
stormagnet says, ":nods"
Crag says, "I don't think they gave me as many as I requsted, either."
stormagnet says, "if it's in your favour, just don't mention"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "there's no reason to bother with it at this point"
stormagnet says, "but yeah, if it's safeway, start out ASSUMING they will fuck something up"
Crag says, "But it's frustrating for me because I know the bean counters will count this against the internet. :)"
Crag nods and sighs
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "their bean counters can't be very good"
Crag says, "clearly!"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "in other news"
Crag says, "Yeah?"
stormagnet says, "I'm home from class early because I screwed ip my elbow"

stormagnet says, "nothing serious"
Crag says, "ok"

stormagnet says, "but lefty typing definitely sucks"
stormagnet says, "though I've gotten better at it, since surgery :P"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I'm much happier getting a little slightly bad news than not hearing from you at all"
stormagnet says, "one thing that I like about Japan, though"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "yeah, I figured I'd tell you straight out, instead of covering"
stormagnet says, "and not push it too hard w/ the keyboard"
stormagnet says, "anyway, the prof actually noticed that something was awry"
stormagnet says, "even though I was trying to cover for it"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "and *made* me go home"
Crag says, "I'm really happy to hear that :)"

Crag hugs!
Crag says, "get well. :)"
stormagnet says, "I will :)"
Crag says, "I'll be around tomorrow as usual."

stormagnet says, "after resting, I'm going to go stock up at the drug store"
stormagnet says, "ace bandages, better ice packs, etc"
stormagnet nods
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "yeah, you should get some good sleep :)"
Crag says, "I'll try"

stormagnet idles: idly idolizing idol's idolatry
Crag says, "So now for some scroll"
Crag says, "This morning I had a weird dream.  I was on the run, carrying a manilla envelope containing bricks of money"
Crag says, "I ran to Newberg (the town my parents look down on) and the streets had all changed and it was much more developed than I remembered"
Crag says, "I got confused by the changes and some one-way streets and ended up running through some appartment complexes, or so I thought"
Crag says, "And I jumped down from this second floor balcony into what I thought was just a courtyard"
Crag says, "Only it turned out that instead of being a bunch of apartments, the complex was a handful of condos for rich people"
Crag says, "And the courtyard I'd dropped into was an enclosed outdoor interior sort of palce"
Crag says, "place"
Crag says, "Not an area between apartments"
Crag says, "And there was no way out and I realized I was clearly intruding."
Crag says, "And then I heard someone coming so I got panicky and tried to hide"
Crag says, "But not knowing the way or anything I ended up getting cornered"
Crag says, "So just as I was about to be discovered I said "BOO!" at the person who was about to find me, figuring I'd scare them and have a chance to escape"
Crag says, "But it worked better than I'd intended, and the woman who found me was terrified, so I tried to comfort her"
Crag says, "But then she started freaking out and I couldn't calm her down"
Crag says, "So I tried to bribe her with the money, but she took almost all of it and tossed the envelope back to me with hardly anything in it"
Crag says, "And I got indignant saying, "hey, you could at least split it with me 50/50 or something", but she said, "what're you going to do about it?  My husband's abotu to show up so you're basically trapped.""
Crag says, "And as I heard the husband hollering that he was home or something I woke up"
Crag says, "And that's probably the most coherent, not-very-trippy dream I've ever remembered."

Crag says, "Based on a game, but looks like something you might like."
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "Not that you don't like anime that start as games"
Crag says, "just that it might be better than one would expect"
Crag says, "damn the upstairs neighbors are noisy"
Crag says, "anyway, I'm putting that series in for-stormy for now (only one episode so far)."
Crag says, "Zero no Tsukaima is kinda dumb, but I've already downloaded a bunch so I put it in for-stormy too"
Crag says, "The primary female charachter's name is Louise, and they pronounce it Louisa, so that amuses me :)"
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "this class is going to frustrate me"
stormagnet says, "it's subject material that I love, that's right in my area"
stormagnet says, "but it's pitched as ESL, and being taught in kind of a patronizing way"
stormagnet says, "like he keeps setting questions up that use deliberately ambiguous semantics"
stormagnet says, "so that then later he can go, 'surprise! this word means two different things! golly, weren't we silly to assume x definition?'"
stormagnet says, "which is.... very frustrating for me"
stormagnet says, "I can see how this would be great as a language learning class"
stormagnet says, "but from a psych. student perspective..."
stormagnet says, "and he keeps blowing off anything that's from a 'traditional psychology' perspective...."
stormagnet says, "this is making me crazy"
stormagnet says, "he's talking about insufficient definitions and semantic assumptions"
stormagnet says, "only we're not allowed to use the 'traditional' specific psychology definitions"
stormagnet says, "or semantics"
stormagnet says, "omfg no"
stormagnet says, "he doesn't get it"
stormagnet says, "he doesn't realize that this is what he's doing"
stormagnet says, "I only realized that just now"
stormagnet says, "he's doing that 'oh words have these funny meanings that we can't possibly define so now lets hug'"
stormagnet is starting to get very irritated 
stormagnet says, "this is like a class in logical fallacies"
stormagnet says, "taught via demonstration"
stormagnet says, "and ALL his explanations are analogies"
stormagnet says, "again, great for learning a second language"
stormagnet says, "but sloppy fucking academics"
stormagnet says, "......"
stormagnet says, "but it's an easy credit, and I don't want to register for something else at this late of a date..."
stormagnet says, "because then I'll have a shit ton of paperwork, red tape, and make-up work"
stormagnet says, "goddammit"
stormagnet says, "I'm in for another semester of teeth gnashing and silent anguish"
stormagnet says, "here's hoping it will at least make for some interested rants"
stormagnet says, "I'm officially done talking in this class"
stormagnet says, "for instance, this classcould be a really good catalyst for blogging about these concepts that I want to explain"
stormagnet says, "I've been meaning to blog about them, but I don't really have a structure in my head for describing it to people"
stormagnet says, "but this class gives me a framework, template, contrast, whatever"
stormagnet says, "where I'm sitting there, with these automatic responses where I go, "No! that's wrong! it should be this!" and then I could just wrote it right then to let that frustration out, and voila! I have a blog entry on the subject, without sittintg there in my pajamas with a beer staring at a blank screen and going, 'uh......""

stormagnet says, "that, or they have even *more* overpriced foam ones"
stormagnet says, "that again provide no compression, only 'heat therapy'"
stormagnet says, "ugh"

stormagnet says, "I wasn't feeling very well, so I ended up taking a really long nap"
stormagnet says, "but, I must say this-"
stormagnet says, "Japanese doctors and hospitals suck"
stormagnet says, "and the Japanese government totally robbed the savings accounts of its population, leading to a massively afing population in which none of them can afford to retire, because their retirement savings were blatantly stolen"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "godDAMN their welfare services for the disabled and terminally ill is WAY better than the US"
stormagnet says, "like..... DAMN."
stormagnet says, "I can't believe that me, a foreign resident only come to stay for one year, is being offered services like this"
stormagnet says, "It looks like I'll be getting ALL my medical care for free"
stormagnet says, "including having the measly $30 a month for the National Insurance plan, and those <$10 co-payments, waived"
stormagnet says, "and my meds for free too"
stormagnet says, "and if I had tried to get my wheelchair here, it would have been free"
stormagnet says, "and they pay for modifying residences for wheelchair access- including stairlifts"
stormagnet says, "and I'll be getting about the equivelant of $155 a month stipend"
stormagnet says, "without any of the bullshit the US was giving me"
stormagnet says, "I just had to go to a doctor, show him my records from the US, and he signed off on them, and that was it"
stormagnet says, "NOW"
stormagnet says, "that said, it might have been that *getting* those documents would have been an even bigger nightmare here than in the US"
stormagnet says, "but I'm pretty relieved"
stormagnet says, "the flip side of this, though, is  that I think this might have something to do with the low college attendance rate"
stormagnet says, "that anyone with any disability os expected to spend their entire lives completely dependant upon their families and the state"
stormagnet says, "looks like they'll also pay to repair or replace my chair if it breaks"
stormagnet eyes her manual chair
stormagnet . o O ( that one might already qualify as broken, considering that wheel, and the satate of the seat... )
stormagnet . o O ( and the tire that came off )
stormagnet says, "SWEET- I can get transportation discounts, too"
stormagnet says, "INCLUDING THE SHINKANSEN"
stormagnet . o O ( fuck yeah I'm going to Osaka )
stormagnet . o O ( ....or anywhere the hell else in Japan I feel, like, apparantly )
stormagnet . o O ( wonder if this stacks with my students discount? )
stormagnet says, "50% off!! sweeeeeet"
stormagnet says, "ooooooohhh"
stormagnet says, "it looks like if I bring a 'personal attendant', they get the same discount"
stormagnet says, "and 30% off domestic airfare..."
stormagnet says, "helLO Okinawa!"
stormagnet says, "would you like to be my special spring break friend, Okinawa?"
stormagnet says, "how about you, Kyoto?"
stormagnet says, "eeeheheheheheh"
stormagnet says, "oops, no- the attendant discount only applies to those under 12 years old"
stormagnet says, "D'OH!!!"
stormagnet says, "if I'd gotten a phone from any of the three providers BUT softbank, I would have gotten a discount once I presented my handicap cert"
stormagnet says, "dammmit"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "I'm still within 30 days, I think"
stormagnet says, "maybe it's not too late"
stormagnet says, "oh son of a bitch@$%#@#$!@!!@!"
stormagnet says, "that's why I got so much money from my Stafford"
stormagnet says, "it wasn't that they realized Japan was @$#%!@ expensive"
stormagnet says, "it was because the IPE had a glitch in their billing system and didn't deduct their $600 fee"
stormagnet says, "fuckers"
stormagnet has the HATE
stormagnet says, "but, in other news, I might be on TV"
stormagnet says, "NHK is filming a special episode of "Cool Japan" on the Mita Campus"
stormagnet says, "and the International Center sent me not one, but TWO emails encouraging me to sign up"
stormagnet puts on her monkey suit and her war paint
Crag laughs
Crag says, "monkey suit?!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "So Japan is full of surprises."

Crag says, "oh.. lovely complex 24 is out"
Crag says, "downloading now"
Crag says, "I don't want it to be over!"
Crag says, "There are over 2000 seeders and 1300 leachers."
Crag says, "I don't think I've ever seen that many people sharing a file on animesuki"
Crag says, "You got mail from the student loan folks.  It looks like they're just saying they sent you money."
Crag says, "let me know if you need any more information than that :)"
Crag says, "two more minutes to lovely complex 24"
Crag makes tea
Crag sighs
Crag says, "I put the last Lovely Complex in for-stormy"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I will watch that ASAP!!"
stormagnet says, "..."
Crag nodsnods!
stormagnet says, "and yeah, we should totally get some crazy-awesome log-enhancing scripts going"
stormagnet says, "date and time stamping is totally necessary"
stormagnet says, "and it would be cool if we could run little status reg-exes or "
stormagnet says, "where we update flags for searching by later"
stormagnet says, "also"
stormagnet says, "I think I'm going to pull a naughty and report Lost in Blue lost to GameFly"
stormagnet says, "because I *really* want to keep it"
stormagnet says, "and it's not for sale"
stormagnet says, "and it's the only reason we haven't just closed that damn account, anyway"
stormagnet says, "we could always open a new one- the early adopter benefits aren't that great"
Crag says, "I will be slow to respond because Melanie is talking to me about Daniel"
stormagnet says, "heee!"
stormagnet says, "talk away"
stormagnet says, "I'm playing Lost in Blue right now, anway :P"
Crag says, "Whew, saved by Molly"
Crag says, "Melanie's going to talk to Molly now"
Crag says, "Melanies SURE Daniel's going to break up with her for reals this time!!!!"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm... sure"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "what's she pissed about now?"
Crag says, "The seed of their current strife is that Melanie doesn't prioritize looking for work as high as Daniel thinks she should"
Crag says, "There are complicating factors, of course, but that's the start of the current wave"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "They scheduled a trip to France, but then Daniel decided he didn't want to go after all"
stormagnet says, "what's she living off of right now?"
stormagnet says, "savings?"
Crag says, "She has tons of money saved"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "She can take care of herself"
Crag says, "People think just because pisces are sensitive that we're weak"
Crag says, "fuckers"
stormagnet says, "in that case, I'd be on her side, in that it's her money, so what she does with it is her business"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "Daniel's being retarded"
Crag says, "There's no doubt about that"
Crag says, "The reason he's being retarded is because he feels old and trapped"
Crag says, "His body is failing him and he has nothing to look forward to"
Crag says, "So he's depressed and he's either blaming Melanie or he's trying to protect her by pushing her away"
Crag says, "or both"
Crag says, "I don't know"
Crag says, "I haven't talked to him about it"
Crag says, "it's not the kind of conversation I want to have over the phone"
Crag says, "I'm a little disappointed in him, but I can also relate"
Crag says, "I really don't want anything to do with any of it"
Crag says, "I love them both and wish they'd shut up and get over it"
Crag says, "but that's not helpful"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "When I've been in those spots it seemed like nothing anyone did helped me"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "Maybe Cecilia helped me a little"
Crag says, "I don't know how though"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So I did a little awkward laughing and a little sighing"
stormagnet says, "it's not exactly a precise science, or anything"
Crag says, "of course"
Crag says, "I just want to help and it pains me to feel so unhelpful"
stormagnet says, "I certainly know that feeling"
Crag says, "yeah, you've been with me for six years!"
Crag grins.
Crag hugs too :)
Crag says, "I'm sorry for all the times I'm difficult :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet cuddles
Crag says, "you've been very supportive, and don't ever think I don't notice"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag smiles and hugs lots.
Crag says, "so!"
Crag says, "how's you?"
stormagnet says, "pretty good"
stormagnet says, "glad it's friday"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "yay friday!"
Crag says, "Have you watched any of the Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei yet?"
stormagnet says, "not yet ^_^;;"
Crag says, "You will want to be wearing pants in order to hold your ass on... so it doesn't fall off from laughing."
stormagnet says, "I have to head back to campus pretty soon for a meeting, so I didn't want to start watching something I wouldn't want to stop"
stormagnet says, "hee!!"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "So I should try to go to bed early and get up early to get more stormy time?"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "ok, I'll try"
stormagnet says, "that's a great idea ^_^"
Crag says, "I will set my alarm for 6am."
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I utterly failed to get up at 6"

stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "that's not surprising"
stormagnet says, "I never manage to get up early when I plan to"
stormagnet says, "the sleep- it feels... so... goooooooooooood"
Crag says, "and since I know it's early, I know I can sleep in"
stormagnet says, "precisely!"
Crag says, "And then I get mad at the cats for spoiling my sleeping in"
stormagnet says, "and whatever it was that you were waking up early for, it suddenly just doesn't feel that important"
stormagnet says, "it can always wait"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "At least I didn't sleep in 'till 9"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I dreampt about work"
Crag says, "That was terrible"
Crag says, "In my dream someone called me in a panic about something that wasn't that important"
Crag says, "And I had to tell them to send us a ticket abou it"
Crag says, "and I just knew they thought I was blowing them off, which I kinda was, but still"
Crag says, "I also had no idea what they were talking about (which is normal on our team, not just a dreaming thing)"
Crag says, "I knew enough to know it wasn't an emergency and that they shouldn't have called me directly about it"

stormagnet wibbles

Crag says, "I can't find the real original source for that"
Crag says, "All the "tiger hug" stuff on google is just that same picture on other people's "cool/funny pictures" sites."

stormagnet says, "omfg"
stormagnet says, "I just caught a coconut crab in Lost in Blue"
Crag says, "wow!"
Crag . o O ( scary! )
stormagnet says, "it was huge!"
Crag says, "It should be!"
Crag says, "And yes, you should totally report that lost"
Crag says, "the game"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet does so now
stormagnet says, "I'm going to wait a little to cancel the account"
stormagnet says, "so it doesn't look TOO suspicious ^_^;;"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "are there any games you think you might want to play on the Alley 24 PS2?"
Crag says, "no"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag says, "I have lots of other stuff I want to do"

stormagnet says, "I'M looking forward to doing that when I get back"
Crag says, "st00pid enter key next to the apostrophy]"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Need narrower enter keys"
Crag says, "Things I want to do instead of play games: network cleanup, guitar/keyboard practice and composition, um..."
Crag says, "programming"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "there's something else"
Crag says, "don't remember"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "oh yeah, social life"
Crag says, "So Greg's game's almost certainly starting in 3-4 weeks"
Crag says, "It's waiting for James' game to finish"
Crag says, "Strangely enough, Ben told Greg to make sure I didn't have lingering drama with Kia and James.  I have no idea where Ben would get the idea that I would have drama with James.  I can't even match the name to a face."
stormagnet was wondering about that
Crag says, "Kia I get, though there's no drama of course."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I might ask Ben some time in case he has some confusion I need to clear up"
Crag says, "I like the short little 'mrow' Marco makes when I pet him when he's not expecting it."
stormagnet says, "heee!"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "the electric skateboard faq says riding on anything other than a smooth dry surface will damage the electronics."
Crag says, "So that's that"
Crag says, "no electric skateboard for me"
stormagnet says, "weak"
stormagnet says, "figures"
stormagnet says, "there's always a catch like that somewhere"
stormagnet :p
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I should have looked at the faq sooner instead of fantasizing for several weeks"
Crag says, "I even rode my board to work yesterday to test the feasability"
Crag says, "it was very bumpy"
Crag says, "The only other option I'd consider is a bike and that means I have to get bike storage at the office and home"
Crag says, "So maybe I'll just be walking to work FOREVER"
Crag says, "Trading a 30 minute drive for a 30 minute walk was an improvement, but I'd like to get my commute under 10 minutes somehow"
stormagnet says, "ehn, it's good exercise...?"
Crag says, "that's true"
Crag says, "except it's been hard on my ankles"
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet says, "part of that is likely your shoes' fault, tho"
Crag says, "actually, everything below my knees hurts"
stormagnet says, "you need to get some good walking shoes"
Crag says, "could be"
Crag says, "definitely, even"
Crag says, "damn, 8:30 already"
Crag says, "I've got an hour left :)"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "you could always chat from work"
stormagnet says, "though I should go to bed soon, anyway"
Crag says, "I don't want to waste that 30 minute walk not chatting :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'll just stick around as long as you're up"
stormagnet says, "yeah, but exercise is good for your health"
stormagnet worries about your health
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "but good shoes are a MUST"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "My list of things I might want to buy when I've saved up money is down to: monitor, roomba, bicycle"
Crag says, "The price of cheap monitors hasn't changed since that $300 bargain disappeared"
Crag says, "So I'm looking at either 1600x1200 for $250 or 1900x1200 for $400"
Crag says, "no point thinking about it before I've surpassed my savings goal, I guess"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "the price might drop again by then"
stormagnet says, "remember, there will be xmas sales soon"
Crag says, "oh yeah"
stormagnet says, "right after thanksgiving, EVERYTHING goes on sale"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'll wait until then"
Crag says, "for everything"
Crag says, "except for shoes"
Crag says, "where should I go for shoes?"
stormagnet says, "good question"
stormagnet says, "Nordstrom's been kind of sucking...."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I was thinking I should go to a sports-oriented place"
stormagnet says, "check google for a red wing store?"
stormagnet says, "I hear they're pretty good..."
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "red wing is hiking / sports"
Crag says, "I was thinking maybe I'd go over to REI since they're so close :)"
stormagnet says, "for that matter"
stormagnet loses
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "I think I'll do that."
stormagnet says, "they might be more expensive"
stormagnet says, "but it could be worth it for the service"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Since I'm a n00b and all"
Crag says, "If I knew what I wanted that would be different"
Crag says, "I need shoes with six-inch soles containing multiple shock absorbers."
Crag says, "or roller skates with suspension and motors."
Crag says, "and huge wheels"
Crag says, "or a segway"
Crag says, "not"
Crag says, "Maybe I should look for an electric scooter like Jamin used to ride."
Crag | http://urbanscooters.com/cgi-bin/urbanscooters/X-600.html
Crag says, "same price as the skateboard, more capacity, more power, more range, more speed"
Crag says, "and ten-inch pneumatic tires"
stormagnet says, "hmmmmmm"
stormagnet says, "but then, why not Katie?"
Crag says, "I could bring the scooter up to my cube"
stormagnet says, "whoa"
Crag says, "no parking at all"
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "At least, I think I could?"
Crag says, "also, it's electric"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag says, "I could see paying for parking for an electric motorcycle"
Crag says, "But the tech's not ready yet"
Crag says, "Marco's bein' all cute 'n lazy right now"
Crag says, "thought you'd want to know"
Crag says, "That scooter weighs 75 pounds and it folds up"
stormagnet says, "awwwwwwwwww"
stormagnet says, "cute marco!"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "that's only 5 pounds lighter than my chair"
stormagnet says, "course, that's chair w/ out batteries"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "and it has similar milage"
Crag says, "yes :)"
Crag says, "So we could be electric together"
stormagnet says, "but are you really ok lifting that much to bring it up to your cube?"
stormagnet says, "that *would* rock"
Crag says, "I guess I figured I'd roll it into the elevators and all that"
Crag says, "I wonder if there's somewhere around here I could check one out"
Crag says, "I have no idea where to look"
stormagnet says, "there's that one place across from minnies"
stormagnet says, "next to the vespa dealership"
stormagnet says, "i remember seeing some electric scooters there before"
Crag says, "oh, maybe I'll stop by there this weekend"
Crag says, "If nothing else they could probably point me in the right direction"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I should probably head to work now"
Crag says, "I just remembered I have SOCWAR to go to at 10"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll see you online in 10 hours or so :)"
Crag hugs
stormagnet hugs!
Crag :)
stormagnet says, "I'll be going to Shinjuku w/ Machiko tomorrow, but I'll be back later"
stormagnet says, "and I'll try and email you some pictures"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "yay pictures!"
Crag says, "I love pictures"
Crag says, "Marco is very soft!"
Crag says, "ok, I'm seriously going now :)"
Crag hugs and kisses
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "love you!"
Crag says, "I love you too!!"
Crag says, "and I miss you a lot"
Crag says, "I'm glad we can talk online"
Crag says, "ok, here I go"

Crag throws that mail away with extreme prejudice.
Crag says, "In other financial news, I think I can pay off the whole CapOne card this month."
Crag says, "I don't think we should rule out me visiting you in Japan."
Crag says, "It's true that it's very expensive, and costs more than everything else on my wishlist combined, it's also a rare opportunity"

Crag says, "and you might end up making a lot of money doing tutoring"

Crag says, "Will it heal well?"

Crag nods.
Crag says, "But lucky for her that she has a place she can stay while she heals, right?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Obviously it'd be better if she weren't hurt at all."
stormagnet nods!

stormagnet says, "precisely"

Crag says, "I'll keep talking while you're away, as usual"
Crag . o O ( MOO is the best way to go )
Crag says, "I'm thinking if we say all our non-stundent-loan debt is paid and we have some large amount saved between us by some time, then we are all-systems-go"
Crag says, "Maybe the deadline should be eight weeks before the break"
Crag says, "And the amount saved is $cost_of_vacation + $comfort_level_savings"
Crag says, "I think $cost_of_vacation is probably $plane_tickets + $vacation_days * $50"
Crag says, "But you'll have a better idea about that"
Crag says, "the minimum $comfort_level_savings for me is $3000 I think"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "sounds like a good plan"
stormagnet says, "it'll take some work, though"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "How long is your spring break?"
stormagnet says, "realisatically, it'll probably cost more than $50 a day"
Crag says, "Would $100 be safe?"
stormagnet says, "BUT, added to the usual cost per day in general, it seems reasonable"
stormagnet says, "we can budget"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "and I think I might be able to get some scholarships and/or grants for the trip"
stormagnet says, "because I'll be using it to collect data for my research project"
Crag says, "Me visiting?"
stormagnet says, "the trip around Japan"
Crag says, "Oh!"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "Sweet!"
stormagnet says, "ergo it being during my spring break"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Now I understand"
Crag says, "This is another example of you being a genius"
stormagnet says, "that's why I figured it would be more expensive"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Sure"
Crag says, "It'll be an even better adventure for both of us then"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "I'll get to feel helpful assisting you with your research, too"
stormagnet says, "we can go all over"
stormagnet says, "take cool trains"
Crag says, "If it works out"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "stay in those old-fashioned inns"
stormagnet says, "with the hot springs"
stormagnet says, "ryokan!"
Crag says, "awesome!"
stormagnet says, "onsen!"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "want!"
stormagnet says, "YES!"
stormagnet says, "eat strange and wonmderful foods..."
stormagnet says, "many of which I think you'll actually like"
Crag says, "I'll be brave!"
stormagnet says, "like gyuudon"
stormagnet says, "beef bowl"
Crag says, "I remember you mentioning that one"
Crag says, "It sounded good when you described it to me"
stormagnet says, "and ohtoro"
stormagnet says, "the fancy maguro"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "like is in your tekka-maki, only classier"
Crag says, "I have expensive tastes"
stormagnet says, "Japan really loves meat, though"
stormagnet says, "more than I would have thought"
stormagnet says, "so you'll be wel;l covered on that front"
stormagnet says, "and who knows?"
Crag . o O ( mmmmmmmmmeat )
stormagnet says, "in the right environment, at the right time, stuff you didn't like much before might start tasting good to you"
Crag says, "that's true"
stormagnet says, "remember how long I spent trying to talk you into trying curry?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "But Japanese curry is a lot different"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I still don't like Indian curry"
stormagnet says, "but I think there are other things that will be like that"
stormagnet says, "that you won;t think that you'd like, but end up liking after all"
Crag says, "I'm ready to try"
stormagnet says, "no need to force yourself"
stormagnet hugs
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "there'll be plenty of ordinary stuff, too"
stormagnet says, "but NO BURRITOES"
stormagnet mourns
Crag says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "I might be able to scrounge up the ingrediants to make my own, tho"
Crag says, "I expect the beans, tortillas and spices are the hard part?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet . o O ( therewerebeanslotsofbeansyeahbeanslotsofbeans )
Crag says, "I wonder what a rice tortilla would be like"
stormagnet says, "eeeew"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "just curious"
stormagnet says, "no need to resort ot that, though"
stormagnet laughs
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I'm sure it would be like those rice wrappers for gyoza, or wonton"
stormagnet says, "or the rice pancakes they serve with muu shuu veg"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I think you're right"
Crag says, "that would be wRong (with a capital R)"
stormagnet nbods
Crag . o O ( cats )
Crag says, "they are having a lazy day today"
Crag says, "Oh, I solved another Project Euler problem today :)"
Crag says, "er, two actually"
stormagnet says, "apologies for the long lag"
stormagnet says, "me and my entrails were Having A Discussion"

Crag tries to look innocent.
Crag . o O ( FAIL )
stormagnet says, "and it's harder to get online when Machiko is here, because I don't want to be rude and ignore her, or anything"

stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "ok, srsly, homeworking now"

Crag nodsnods
stormagnet idles: homeworking for the MAN
Crag says, "Holy shit ubuntu rules"
Crag says, "The ssh app for horde uses a java applet.  Firefox and Ubuntu conspired to get a free applet player plugin for my 64bit machine."
Crag says, "asking for my password so they could get root perms to set it up globally instead of just for me."
Crag says, "But the applet is not working.  damn."
Crag tries from his laptop
Crag says, "looks like maybe the applet viewer install didn't work.  pooh"
Crag says, "The applet ran in windows but won't connect.  grr"
Crag says, "well I'm stumped.  I'll bang on it more later."

stormagnet says, "and they have me a bit flustered"
stormagnet says, "one from the Dean, officially notifying me that I have crossed the magic 180 credit mark and need to Graduate Or Else, unless I have a Really Good Excuse"
stormagnet thought she had a little more tijme left, but no.....
stormagnet will need to contact the Psych department about officially applying to the major, if possible, from abroad
stormagnet says, "which is especially weird, because I had just had a dream about doing just that "
Crag says, "yay chatting from class!"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "I thought your scholastic intentions were pretty clear"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "They are clear to ME"
stormagnet says, "but I will need to clarify them to the Dean"
stormagnet says, "since there is a Rule"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "stupid rules"
stormagnet says, "what I had been worried about for awhile, thus my rushing through so many credits"
Crag [sings]: Saturn comes back around.
Crag says, "I remember"

Crag [sings]: Drags you down like a stone,
Crag looks up the rest of the lyrics :)

Crag peers

Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "more like *a* week, if I don't go for the add on"
stormagnet says, "I don;t know how much it would cost, though"
Crag says, "The front page kinda makes it sound like an employee scouting thing"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of thinking of the Technology conference in China"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it's connected to that Golden Key Honor Society"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "China does seem like a likely place to find more of the evil you're chasing."
stormagnet says, "Apparantly, that's how I got nominated"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "There's also one on Diplomacy & International Relations that would fit"
Crag says, "A week doesn't seem like very long"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "there website is slow"
stormagnet says, "ooof"
Crag says, "their"
Crag says, "I can't believe I made that mistake"
stormagnet says, "tuition is $5000"
Crag shock!
stormagnet says, "there's scholarships, but I don't think so"
Crag says, "At that price it might as well be a front for sexual tourism."
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "and it looks like we don't even get meals with that!"
stormagnet says, "this thing is a total scam"
stormagnet says, "I could go on a fucking cruise for that"
stormagnet says, "one of those Scientific American cruises, even"
stormagnet says, "nope, whoopps"
stormagnet says, "meals are included"
stormagnet   on Diplomacy & International Relations that would

Crag says, "It sounds like a regular touristy trip"
Crag says, "Day 5: Wonder of the Ages: China's Great Wall"
stormagnet says, "eeew"
stormagnet says, "um... that is not what I think about when I think about studying Tech in China"
stormagnet says, "HISTORICAL tech, maybe"
stormagnet says, "eeeew"
stormagnet says, "it's tourism, schmooze, and a Chinese PR propoganda trap all in one!"
stormagnet says, "fuck that!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it's an inflated tour package"
stormagnet says, "that's it"
stormagnet feels embarassed to have even thoght about it
Crag says, "you didn't know what it was"
Crag says, "Good thing we figured it out right away"
stormagnet nods!
Crag watches Hayate no Gotoku while chatting. :)
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "I'm going to have trouble watching anime this month"
stormagnet says, "well, no, there's my breaks between classes"
stormagnet says, "Machiko will still be at work then"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "so that's all right :)"
Crag says, "While I've got you on the line, is there anything special you want me to do with your medical bills, or should I just pay them whenever I can?"
stormagnet says, "the latter sounds like a good plan"
stormagnet says, "about the same as I had"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "I didn't know if you had something up your sleeve :)"
stormagnet says, "though we should keep track of which we pay when, and keep records/receipts for taxes/other insurance"
Crag says, "oh, ok"
Crag says, "I'll figure something out, somehow..."
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "just a notebook would work"
stormagnet says, "write it down when you pay it, and I can use that to edit the budget spreadsheet later"
stormagnet says, "but when mail comes from a medical biller, keep it"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag idles: dinner w/ ty
[Idling at 7:00 P.M. on Sun, Oct 14: dinner w/ ty]
stormagnet cheers
stormagnet says, "yay for hang-out-ing "
Crag says, "I'm giving Zippo to Ty now."
Crag says, "And now it's done."
Crag says, "He's going to take delivery Thursday"
Crag says, "And I may give Katie to Shea under similar terms"
Crag says, "The terms for Zippo are:"
Crag says, "Ty takes care of all the remaining problems (tags, lights, breaks, oil, weird noises, etc)"
Crag says, "If I want the car back in less than 10 months I pay him $500 - $50 x months from now"
Crag says, "If he wants to sell it, before or after 10 months, I can just take it back"
Crag says, "If I don't take it back, he splits the proceeds with me 50/50"
Crag says, "If he wrecks it I get half of the insurance"

[Idling at 12:38 A.M. on Mon, Oct 15: damn the torpedoes, full sleep ahead!]
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you figured out a way to sort things out satisfactorily- that sounds like a pretty good arrangement for all parties involved"
stormagnet says, "crap"
stormagnet says, "ok, that IPE fee?"
stormagnet says, "that they were supposed to automatically deduct from my Financial Aid, but didn't?"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to have to use the BofA account to pay it"
stormagnet says, "instead of the CapOne card, where I actually *put* the Financial Aid money"
stormagnet says, "BECAUSE"
stormagnet says, "the @$#%@$!!! UW charges $77 FUCKING DOLLARS"
stormagnet says, "as a "convenience fee""
stormagnet says, "for using a fucking credit card!!"
stormagnet says, "that's a PERCENTAGE, by the way"
stormagnet says, "I got that fee quote by telling them HOW MUCH I WAS PAYING"
stormagnet is emphatically glad she checked the small print
stormagnet says, "MOTHER"
stormagnet says, "FUCKERS"
stormagnet says, "Anyway, I checked BofA, and it looks like we have plenty to cover it"
stormagnet says, "but if you have any big expenditures coming up, or pending"
stormagnet says, "you'll want to make a cash transfer from the CapOne card"
stormagnet says, "WHICH"
stormagnet says, "even with our EXORBITANT fucking SHIT-CREDIT-RATING RATES"
stormagnet says, "is STILL less than that 'convenience fee'"
stormagnet continues cursing
stormagnet has to pay it now, too, due to deadlines
Crag wakes, reads scroll
Crag says, "We don't have any big charges coming up any time soon"
Crag says, "Rent is paid and the check has already been cashed."
Crag says, "I got more of those CapOne checks and was thinking of paying next month's rent with one"
Crag says, "But I was also thinking it'd be paid off first."
Crag says, "But that's two weeks from now"
Crag says, "We can revisit that topic later."
Crag says, "We'll be saving almost $300 a month in parking and insurance once I get both zippo and katie taken care of"
Crag says, "Got more news from my mom.  My dad's getting around in a wheelchair and a walker now."
Crag says, "I'm off to work."
Crag says, "snuggles and smooches"
Crag says, "er"
That is not a valid command.

Crag says, "Yeah, I plugged the game in and played for a few minutes"
Crag says, "It dropped me right into surgery and I was all 'ew!' and put it away"
Crag says, "Not Roberty"

Crag says, "Very high energy, very positive vibe"

Crag says, "I was flailing around and jumping around all night and I thought I was going to collapse"
Crag says, "And then when they did their real last song (for the encore) I couldn't help but jump around some more!"
Crag says, "It was like I was a rat and they were the pied pipers!"
Crag says, "Whatever they were selling, I was buying"
Crag says, "I was picking up what they were laying down"
Crag says, "it was fantastic"

stormagnet says, "so I had to go through a bunch of hoops for that"
stormagnet says, "settled for the Japanese Lit class- it's a bunch of stuff I've done before, or excerpts of, so it'll be easy to catch up, but still fun"
stormagnet says, "ooog"
stormagnet says, "I forgot to bring a snack today >_<"
stormagnet has teh tummy rumble
Crag back
Crag says, "Since I napped for about four hours, I can stay up 'till 3am my time, in theory"
Crag says, "I need to think of more stuff I can order from Safeway that I actually want and will keep for a long time."
Crag mmm cookies
Crag . o O ( so a relatively long time, is what I'm saying I guess )
Crag says, "no black box wine on the website"
Crag says, "OH the other hand... they DO have Salmon Harbor."
Crag says, "At $5 a bottle, even"
Crag says, "Which is the same price as Black Box when Black Box isn't on sale."
Crag says, "I'm gonna get myself some."
Crag says, "That will give me more reason to get someone to hang out at the apartment with me"
stormagnet says, "oooooh"
stormagnet says, "stock up!"
Crag heh
Crag says, "I got four bottles"
stormagnet says, "try and save one for when I get back?"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I'll probably need to pad more catfood orders in the future, so I'll probably end up stocking up on Salmon Harbor over time."
stormagnet says, "thankee :)"
Crag says, "We already have an online account w/ Verizon, don't we?"
Crag says, "It told me there wasn't one for my number"
Crag says, "I didn't try your number though"
Crag says, "But I thought I paid the bill online last month"
Crag says, "I wonder if I'm on the right site"
Crag says, "Huh.  Our verizon account must consider your cell number to be associated with the primary account holder"
Crag says, "ah, got in with your number and one of the usual passwords.  heh"
Crag says, "used 213 of our 500 minutes this month."
Crag says, "not including 190 'promotional' minutes and 43 verizon-to-verizon minutes."

Crag says, "And the meeting and started and ended with her singing and playing guitar"
Crag says, "And Steve Wadsworth announced that future meetings will start and end with staff talent"
Crag says, "So I'm thinking Nicole and I should throw together some songs and play :)"
Crag says, "I haven't talked to her about it yet"
Crag says, "I suspect she might chicken out because OMG WORK PEOPLE CAN'T KNOW HER SECRET IDENTITY"
Crag says, "Greg sent out his info packet for his game"
Crag says, "Should I send you a copy for your own amusement?"

stormagnet loses
Crag laughs
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "That and she's taking that modeling class or whatever it is"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So now she's learning how to do runway walks and stuff"
stormagnet says, "yow"
Crag says, "yeah, she was trying on shoes today before her class"
Crag says, "And she did a little walk"
Crag says, "woof"
stormagnet says, "goodness that girl is going to be dangerous"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "From the stories she's telling about school, she's already terrorizing her peers"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "it's pry for their own good"
Crag says, "She was telling me today (while changing shoes) that some people were trying to confront her about her personality or something"
stormagnet snorts
Crag says, "Saying that "everyone" thinks she's too obnoxious or something"
Crag says, "But refusing to name names"
Crag says, "So she told them they're stupid and she doesn't need their drama and left it at that"
stormagnet says, "like Thunder would give a rat's ass"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "She's a big fish in a little pond"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "So do you want a copy of Greg's introductory pamphlet thing for his game?"
stormagnet says, "and she has enough healthy social networks outside of school that isolation is totally not a problem"
stormagnet says, "and yes!"
Crag says, "aparently"
Crag forwards greg's mail
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "It has a pdf attachment, should I send it to your phone anyway?"
stormagnet says, "man, in other news, I am freaking *starving* all the time here"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I think I might be losing weight too"
stormagnet says, "even though I'm eating"
stormagnet says, "Japanese food is definitely different"
stormagnet says, "or the environment, or something"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "it's not like I'm getting a lot of exercise, or less calories"
stormagnet says, "I mean, I *checked*"
Crag says, "I had been a little worried that you wouldn't get enough exercise because of being in the chairs all the time"
stormagnet says, "or maybe Japanese calorie counts are just more honest than american ones :P"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I have been too!"
[stormagnet and I haven't had time to go to the pool, either]
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet says, "aheeh"
Crag heh
Crag says, "It's probably OK for you to lose a little weight, but..."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "oh, it's certainly welcome"
Crag says, "perhaps now"
Crag says, "But if it keeps up it will be troublesome"
stormagnet says, "and I don't have a scale, it's just a matter of little things"
Crag says, "yeah, I know how that is"
Crag says, "I still don't fit into most of my pants :)"
stormagnet says, "like, my clothes I brought from home are getting looser, and some Japanese clothes really fit"
Crag says, "It's more like I fit onto my pants."
stormagnet laughs!
Crag heh
Crag says, "Oh poo. I sent Greg's mail to you, but the attachment fell off. :P"
Crag says, "So I'm re-sending"
stormagnet says, "yay...?"
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "I'm... silly"
Crag says, "the attachment didn't fall off, I mis-read the UI"
stormagnet loves that you're silly
Crag says, "no wonder you love me so much"
Crag says, "because I'm VERY SILLY"
Crag says, "Anyway, if one copy of the email is good, three is three times as good, right?!"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I'm gonna need your old phone pretty soon.  my phone has been talking to a lawyer about its will"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag says, "I think my phone may go to Oregon for a Death With Dignity."
stormagnet says, "I pry won't have time to send it until Friday, but I'll shell out for priority"
Crag says, "that's cool"
stormagnet says, "send the old one to one of those charities that outfits them for battered women's shelters and such?"
Crag says, "I could do that"
Crag says, "I'm not sure how, but I can look into it"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "there are some you can look up online that will send you a prepaid mailer for it and everything"
Crag says, "I know it's terrible, but when I see "battered women" I imagine an I Love Lucy scene with Lucy and Ethyl covered in cake batter."
Crag says, "oh cool"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "it's awful, but hilarious"
Try this instead:  I
Crag says, "I has a kitteh"
stormagnet says, "KITTEH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "WANT"
Crag <- has
stormagnet is in serious fluff withdrawl
stormagnet wants to bury her hand in something soft and furry and just squuuueeeeeeze it
stormagnet wants to rub her face in CAT
Crag nods!
stormagnet says, "I seriously get pangs"
stormagnet says, "cuddle pangs"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "Lately Marco has been waking me up with licking"
stormagnet neeeeeeeeds it
stormagnet says, "AW!"
Crag says, "I am delishooos"
stormagnet says, "I seriously need to at least get a stuffed animal or something"
Crag nodsnods.
stormagnet says, "having never gone cold turkey before, I had NO idea how hard it would be"
Crag says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "I have no one and nothing to cuddle here, and it is making me nuts"
Crag says, "I know..."
stormagnet HUGS!!
Crag says, "I'm a little better off in that regard"
stormagnet nods
Crag hugs fiercely!
Crag says, "I won't let you go anywhere by yourself again :)"
if stormagnet hugged any harder, she'd break the internet connection
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "I'm really looking forward to spring break"
stormagnet says, "I will probably start making plans and researching stuff for it just to keep me sane"
Crag says, "That sounds smart"
Crag says, "I'm still trying to think of ways to save more money over here"
Crag says, "I'm going to try migrating mail back to the apartment this coming weekend"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'm really running out- I might have to transfer some money to tide me over until I start getting tutoring gigs"
Crag says, "yeah, I thought you might"
stormagnet says, "but I applied for another scholarship, and that'll help if I get it"
Crag says, "Before you left I'd planned on sending you $500 a month"
stormagnet says, "and I was being *strongly encouraged* to apply"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I remember"
Crag says, "oh, that's good news"
stormagnet says, "but I was hoping to keep going a little longer on my scholarship and such"
stormagnet says, "I think I can last out October, but after that, I'll need to dip into our savings a bit"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "of course, I'm still not quite counting all of the scholarship money I put on the card, either"
Crag says, "I don't know what the situation is with the medical bills, but our cashflow is looking very good on this end"
stormagnet says, "I have to keep reminding myself of where everything went, because it seems strange that I got so many scholarships, and yet am running out of money so fast"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "most of those bills can wait for a very long time"
stormagnet says, "some either have or will go to collections, and we'll want to deal with those first as we can"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "but given the nature of the bills, and the fact that in several instances I felt kind of scammed, I'm in no hurry"
stormagnet says, "and they have very low interest rates"
Crag says, "clearly paying off the card is the first priority then"
stormagnet says, "precisely what I was thinking :)"
stormagnet says, "and we're very close on that front"
Crag says, "I think we can do that by the end of November"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I really need to reserve $400 for a monitor"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm pissed that I can't replace the cable"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "But there's nothing I can do about that."
stormagnet says, "we should get a monitor with a replacable cable this time"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It may be tricky"
Crag says, "I'll take a look"
stormagnet says, "especially if you're budgeting for that nice LCD one"
stormagnet says, "which it looks like you are"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "we'll want to make sure it won't get equally hosed, as that's a big investment"
Crag says, "I'm still shocked that the ViewSonic cable isn't separate"
Crag says, "it seems like it would be cheaper to manufacture the parts independantly."
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "actually"
Crag says, "that gives me an idea"
stormagnet says, "planned obsolecense"
stormagnet says, "I'm betting"
stormagnet says, "which was a bad idea, if it was"
Crag says, "I'm going to see if I can contact ViewSonic about getting a replacement cable."
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "good idea!"
Crag says, "I'm filling out a form now"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "oog"
stormagnet says, "be back in a bit"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of worn out, so I'm going to lie down a bit"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "you should sleep too!!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I guess I'll see you tomorrow :)"
stormagnet nods

stormagnet says, "there is a series of ads on tv here that are just sickening"
stormagnet says, "the ad shows a woman wearing a dress that blends into the store shelves of merchandise, etc, so that at first she's invisible until she moves"
stormagnet says, "then there's the slogan, "you are what you buy""
stormagnet says, "the trick being, of course, that it's in ENGLISH, too, and thus somehow more convincing, or some such shit"
stormagnet says, "the kicker?"
stormagnet says, "IT'S FOR A CREDIT CARD"
stormagnet says, "this ad makes me want to spit bile every time I see it"

stormagnet says, "eeep"
stormagnet says, "that's a pain"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I need to call the doc about modafinil, too"

Crag says, "I'm impatently awaiting my latest safeway.com delivery"
Crag says, "I ordered 120 cans of special diet cat food.  :)"
Crag says, "safeway.com arrived, and they had all my booze"
Crag says, "They were short on the cat food, but included a helpful note on how to order large quantities in the future."
Crag says, "They also delivered 10 fewer cans than they charged me for, but since I counted before letting the guy go, they're going to give me a credit in a few days."
Crag says, "Heh, I dug up one of the stuffed mice when I was looking for the title, and just now Sancho was wandering around with the mousie in his mouth, meowing lowdly."
Crag says, "cats!"
Crag says, "sometimes I like the cats a lot"
Crag says, "like now"
Crag says, "I like them a lot right now"

Crag says, "I've had a lot to drink tonight."
Crag says, "So, while I'm happy about all the good things about your trip to Japan, I'm also feeling especially selfish at this time and I wish you were right here with me where I could look at you and smile and nod and not even have to say anything."
Crag says, "I've always loved the words we've exchanged most of all, but when we can't exchange words I miss being able to communicate without exchanging words."
Crag says, "I miss how you would care for me when I'd drunk enough to be a wreck"
Crag says, "I remember coming back from the 2002 christmas party, upset because I had a crush on Lisa that I didn't know what to do with, and because I had ideas about work that I didn't know what to do with, and because I'd lost one of my prized motorcycle gloves"
Crag says, "And you took me back in and cared for me without any worries except for my safety and general well-being"
Crag says, "You just wanted the best for me no matter what"

stormagnet watching lucky star and commentating again
stormagnet says, "so a) the weird joke Tsubasa mentions in #22 that doesn't sound much like a weird joke?"
stormagnet says, "I totally got it!"
stormagnet says, "it startled me, too, since it's a REALLY recent reference"
stormagnet says, "to a recurring comedy act on TV here"
stormagnet says, "she was imitating a line from it, and the act itself is really weird"
stormagnet says, "I will try to find a YouTube of it"
stormagnet says, "and b) that thing about suddenly being wide awake after lying down in bed makes me wonder if her constant sleepiness is a blood pressure thing like mine is"
stormagnet says, "which isn't quite as unrealistic as it seems- I gather that having low blood pressure is both more common and treated more seriously here than in th US"
stormagnet says, "I have to explain the hell out of it back home, but here I just say 'teiketsuatsu' and suddenly everybody gets really understanding and sympathetic :P"
stormagnet says, "and in the following conversation, I understand both Kagami ANd Konata"

stormagnet says, "(and my god, they do that a lot here- this culture has a REALLY different concept of privacy and personal space)"
stormagnet says, "and she was really impressed that classical characters were at the top of my autocompletion list"
stormagnet says, "especially since you have to use them a LOT before they do that, since they're kind of negatively weighted"
stormagnet says, "and have to be specially enabled in a sub menu"
stormagnet says, "so it's instant proof that I spent a LOT of time studying classics"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet </brag>
stormagnet says, "but I know right away why 'mood' (fuinki) wouldn't convert"
stormagnet says, "that's a common mispelling- most japanese invert part of the pronunciation"
stormagnet says, "because of vowel assimilation"
stormagnet says, "it's actually 'funiki'"
stormagnet says, "I bet Konata's about to tsukomi her with "I have spelling auto-correction turned off""
stormagnet says, "aw- what a waste"
stormagnet says, "and the cup ramen joke was that making ramen is such an automatic process that sometimes it's easy to forget to take stuff out when it's not usualy included"

stormagnet says, "I remembered to send you a picture yesterday"
Crag says, "Oh! I'll go check my mail."
stormagnet also wonders
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I think it will last a while?"
stormagnet hopes!
Crag says, "me too, actually"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "like a recharge, or something"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I could kind of see how this sort of thing might be good for a relationship"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "it's that 7 year pattern"
Crag says, "and we knew that"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that's a cuddly looking sweater"
Crag says, "And I like the smile you're wearing"
Crag says, "thank you for the picture. :)"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "I had actually just then been defining the word "cozy" for Machiko"
stormagnet says, "and used the sweater as an example"
stormagnet ^_^;;
stormagnet says, "then I thought, 'Oh! Picture! I've beden forgetting!'"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I was missing the pictures but I thought you were probably too busy or something"
stormagnet says, "I was, a little"
stormagnet says, "and self conscious"
Crag says, "aw..."
Crag says, "but... so cute"
stormagnet will try to do better in the future
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "So any word on your thing with the UW dean?"
stormagnet says, "not yet"
stormagnet says, "I've been too busy corralling other cats"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "speaking of cats"
Crag says, "I need to clean some cat boxes"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "so feel free to chatter while I idle a few minutes :)"
stormagnet says, "stink wave!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, ""my high-priority cats right now are medication, employment permission, and an exam on Monday"
stormagnet is on the phone with the hospital here right now
stormagnet says, "I meant to get up early enough to call a doc in seattle"
stormagnet says, "but I hadn't finished setting up ekiga when I went to bed last night, and in the end, I just blew it off"
stormagnet says, "I'll try sending a fax first..."
Crag says, "cat boxes are done (blech)"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "heh, high-priority cats - up-tempo jazz band"
stormagnet cheers the conquering hero
Crag struts and poses
stormagnet says, "have I mentioned how much I hate hospitals here?"
Crag says, "once or twice :)"
stormagnet says, "because omg I hate them so much"
stormagnet HATES
Crag says, "they sound pretty crappy"
stormagnet says, "I've been trying to find a way to a) get more than one week's worth of medication at a time, and b) get it WITHOUT having to skip school"
stormagnet says, "so far, I have been stymied on both counts"
stormagnet says, "and if it keeps up at this rate, I will FLUNK amnd get KICKED OUT on the sheer basis OF HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SCHOOL AND MEDICATION"
stormagnet hates hates hates
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I would not do very well if I had to deal with that on my own"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I would probably just avoid the hospital until it turned into an emergency"
stormagnet says, "my solution for now is to cruise by on breakthrough meds until Tuesday, which I *don't* have school on"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and then do ALL the bizarre hoops and circles and crap with AN ENTIRELY NEW DOCTOR"
stormagnet says, "just so that I can go ON A DAY I DON'T HAVE SCHOOL"
stormagnet says, "this will probably cost my that absured 'new patient' fee ALL. OVER. AGAIN"
Crag says, "crappy"
stormagnet says, "unfortunately, it already *is* an emergency..."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but since these idiots can't keep *DAILY* medication and *EMERGENCY* medication straight, I have a simply *enormous* backlog"
stormagnet says, "so, in a pinch, I could possibly squeak by on this stuff for weeks"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "it's side effects are way worse than the patch, which is why I'd been avoiding them in the first place"
stormagnet says, "I think I'm having trouble staying awake NOW?"
stormagnet says, "HAH!"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and they're going to raise my risk of developing a tolerance, too"
stormagnet says, "ergo, HATE"
stormagnet says, "did I mention that orthopedics is only open in the AM?"
stormagnet says, "that's right"
Crag says, "I don't think you did mention that"
stormagnet says, "an entire DEPARTMENT of the hospital is only available BEFORE NOON"
stormagnet says, "god help you if you break your leg IN THE AFTERNOON"
Crag says, "what I'm hearing here is that if Japan is going to outfit you with a mecha suit, it will only be after you've jumped through a maze of beauraucratic hoops."
stormagnet says, "basically"
Crag says, "so frustrating"
stormagnet says, "a maze that would make Kafka weep silently"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "the tears falling onto a blank page"
Crag says, "poor Kafka!"
stormagnet says, "pen dangling limply from his fingertips"
Crag gives Kafka a blanket.
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Speaking of Kafka"
Crag says, "You need to watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "But I can't tell you why because it will ruin the joke"
stormagnet says, "I also need to study for my exam, though :("
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "a little break first would be ok..."
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "but I have a half-watched episode of Lucky Star open..."
Crag says, "you could finish Lucky Star first"
Crag says, "That series is complete at least"
Crag says, "SZS has only reached episode 8 so far on the fansubs"
Crag says, "There are 12 episodes and a sequel series"
Crag says, "oooh, I should make tea"
stormagnet says, "yay tea!"
stormagnet follows suit
Crag says, "mmmm, yummy tea"
Crag says, "SZS gets very high ratings on animenewsnetwork.com"
Crag says, "out of 165 votes, 154 were Good or better, of which 78 were Masterpiece"
stormagnet says, "oooh"
stormagnet says, "OH!"
stormagnet says, "OH!"
stormagnet says, "OH!"
stormagnet forgot to tell you!!!!!!

Crag peers...
stormagnet says, "dont bother trying to read, but looook!"
Crag says, "Arg, it's loading slowly!  The suspense is killing me!"
stormagnet ordered it
stormagnet ^_^;;;
Crag says, "Kotatsu?"
stormagnet says, "YES!!!!"
stormagnet says, "for under $100"
stormagnet says, "with the blankets included!!!"
Crag blinks
stormagnet got the middle pattern
Crag says, "that's awesome!"
stormagnet will be bringing it home, too
stormagnet says, "YES!!!!"
stormagnet says, "even with the airline oversized baggage charge, that's STILL way cheaper than importing"
stormagnet says, "I checked around, too"
stormagnet says, "that was by FAR the best deal"
stormagnet says, "and it's a really cute one!"
stormagnet says, "and big enough for everybody to sit at it at once!"
Crag says, "naturally, it's Japanese"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "That's wonderful"
stormagnet says, "yeah, but most of the ones in that price range were cheap plastic"
Crag says, "ohh"
Crag says, "good find!"
stormagnet says, "with nasty white formica tops"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Don't fall asleep under it!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "this, naturally, is what originally started the 'cozy' discussion"
stormagnet WILL
stormagnet definitely WILL
stormagnet will have nabe and senbei and mikan and ocha
stormagnet says, "and do her homework at it"
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet and do her homework at it
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "um..."
stormagnet says, "aheheheheheh"
Crag says, "you are adorable"
stormagnet says, "and when I get home, the cats will L.O.V.E. it"
Crag says, "clearly"
stormagnet beams
stormagnet says, "I wigged out"
Crag says, "I wish I could get a picture of you asleep at your kotatsu with tea and homework at the ready"
stormagnet says, "and Machiko got caught up in my enthusiasm"
stormagnet giggles
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "I'll let Machiko know "
stormagnet says, "you should email her photo requests :P"
Crag says, "Maybe I will..."
stormagnet says, "the one I got is 120 x 80 cm"
stormagnet says, "nice and big"
stormagnet says, "but not TOO big"
stormagnet says, "will fit nicely in the middle of our studio"
stormagnet says, "and is pretty enough to keep out year round as a regular table"
stormagnet says, "sans futons"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "this is the same store I got the cute cheap clothes from when panicking over the difference in Japanese clothing and Seattle clothing"
stormagnet says, "I think it is run by the same company as La Redoute"
stormagnet says, "there is stock overlap"
stormagnet says, "I <3 it"
Crag says, "yay La Redoute!"
Crag says, "They sent another catalog, but there weren't many good pictures for roberties in it"
Crag says, "it was all fall/winter clothing. :P"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "And now I'm going to watch some Combat Butler, but not full screen"
Crag says, "So I'm still here :)"
Crag says, "The Butler War That Shakes The Planet Has Started"
Crag says, "No genre is safe from ridicule"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "you are going to love this series :)"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
stormagnet says, "I seem to have a comrade in arms in the sneeze department"
Crag says, "Oh?"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, one of the charachters in Lucky Star, huh. :)"
Crag says, "I've alrady forgotten so much!"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "pink haired girl"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "OMG"
stormagnet says, "that is why I always write my blog entries in a text editor first!!!"
stormagnet says, "of course"
stormagnet says, "that's also why my entries are always too long and take forever to write and then I think I don't have enough time to write one...."
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "....."
Crag says, "citizens (me, basically) demand more blog entries... as long as it doesn't interfere with your studies. :)"
stormagnet says, "aheheheh"
stormagnet says, "oh yeah!"
stormagnet says, "email posting!"
stormagnet says, "help?"
Crag says, "oh yeah"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "I'm moving mail back to the apartment this weekend"
Crag says, "and dns"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "So maybe I can work that in too"
stormagnet says, "are we doing away with the colo?"
Crag says, "I hope to"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "seems like the right choice"
Crag says, "For me to justify the colo I'd have to spend a lot more time making use of what it has to offer"
stormagnet says, "we just don't need one enough to justify the price, and our net is pretty good"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "The net is faster at the colo (1gig), but with just mail hosted there on a not-very-fast server it's kinda pointless"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "I think we get a free crappy shell account at speakeasy, too"
Crag says, "SOME DAY I will get all our stuff decked out and fancy (feature wise) and having a colocated server will make sense for availability and performance reasons"
stormagnet says, "we could use that as mail backup, maybe"
Crag says, "But that day will probably not come before you get back"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "prooooooooooojects"
stormagnet says, "feeeeeeechurez!"
Crag says, "yeah, that's one of the features I'd had in mind - redundancy and security"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "@create $feature called Totally Rad Hosting Feature"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "we've got plenty of time"
stormagnet says, "we'll just build things up slowly"
Crag says, "it's hard to remember that"
Crag says, "I still haven't recovered from all the hard drive crashes and rootkits I've experienced"
Crag says, "I had things setup nicely .. eight years ago"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "at some point I need to work harder on colaborative tools so I can harnass more energy from friends"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet says, "I like collabortive workspaces"
stormagnet says, "I want my blog to be one"
Crag says, "Nicole's pretty amped about our project, but our schedules don't align well"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I like your ideas about that"
stormagnet says, "but I'm not getting any input, so it's hard..."
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "I try to promote your blog"
Crag says, "But people are lame"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "don't worry about it"
stormagnet says, "if they don't feel like reading it, there's no need to force them"
stormagnet says, "and then I don't feel so bad about not posting"
stormagnet says, "and the tech behind my original idea all failed, so "
Crag says, "My parents are the only people who read your blog :("
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "And I guess they don't comment"
stormagnet says, "I will try to write some more"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "but I have to get my stuff settled first"
Crag says, "I should write too"
stormagnet says, "getting some automation behind the scenes will really help"
Crag says, "You gave me posting access a while ago and I don't know if I've ever used it"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "and having WordPress instead of Bloxsom already is a world of difference :)"
Crag says, "you know I love automation"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "yeah, bloxsom is crap"
stormagnet says, "email posts would help alot"
Crag sighs at wasted efforts
stormagnet says, "so that I could blog mobiley"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "yosh!  email posts coming right up!"
stormagnet says, "and send in photis as attachments"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "no efforts or experiences are really wasted as long as you remember them and learn from them and don't waste time regretting them"
stormagnet says, "I need to remember that more myself"
Crag nods!
Crag says, "That's a good saying"
Crag says, "Marco says 'hi', by the way"
Crag says, "I don't know if I'm translating cat correctly, but I think he hopes you're eating lots of tasty things, playing with fun toys and curling up and being cozy a lot."
Crag says, "And Sancho says, "whatever""
Crag says, "When I see people in anime enjoying foods, I think "I bet Raine would go 'WANT!' and reach her hand towards the monitor...""
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
stormagnet laughs!!
stormagnet says, "I've been doing that a lot!"
stormagnet says, "all of the above!!"
stormagnet says, "I even remember thinking, "It's ok if I get fat while I'm here. After all, fter going to the trouble of coming to Japan, it would be a waste not to eat all the tasty Japanese food I can get my hands on. So getting fat could almost be considered proof that I was making the most of this experience!""
stormagnet says, "and then, ironically, I seem to be getting thinner?"
stormagnet says, "whatever"
stormagnet laughs
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I agree with your thinking, but I bet in reality you would be sad if you got fat in japan"
stormagnet says, "probably"
stormagnet says, "It's kind of hard being surrounded by tiny beautiful girls"
stormagnet says, "in a whole variety of ways"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "some of those ways come with their own compensations, though "
stormagnet grins
Crag grins
stormagnet . o O ( don'tgetcaughtstaringdon'tgetcaughtstaringdon'tgetcaughtstaring )
Crag says, "I'm glad you're having some fun :)"
stormagnet . o O ( crapgotcaughtstaring )
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I'm having a LOT of fun, really"
stormagnet says, "there are hard parts, and frustrationa plenty, but I'm having a good time"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I'm really glad I'm doing this"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "me too!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "fighting game ending was awesome"
Crag says, "I've forgotten!  remind me?"
stormagnet says, "oh noes last episode!!!"
stormagnet says, "the real minoru and I think the VA for Akira were having a sword fight in fighting game costumes"
stormagnet says, "with a voice-over background-music"
stormagnet says, "I love those endings so much"
Crag says, "Oh! yeah!"
Crag says, "haha!"
Crag says, "I had forgotten about the live action stuff"
Crag hee hee
Crag says, "In the combat butler show they just made fun of how charachters suddenly don't recognize each other when they have masks on"
Crag says, "WHO IS THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSON?!"
Crag says, "so funny"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "last episode so good"
stormagnet snickers
stormagnet says, "My Japanese isn't quite good enough to get called on it when I pretend not to understand"
stormagnet says, "but then, I haven't tried that trick with anybody who *knows* me"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I might have to re-watch the last episode"
stormagnet says, "I'm still at the 'generally ok, but make mistakes / ask definitions for unknown words in ways that native speakers seem to find hilarious'"
stormagnet says, "stage"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "a lot of the time, my asking a definition gets a 'you really, REALLY don't need to know a word like that. In fact, best to forget you ever heard it' response"
stormagnet says, "which serves, of course, only to egg me on"
Crag nodsnods!
Crag says, "That's how you roll"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "and sometimes I do imitations that make Machiko and profs spit-take"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "and I confuse words that are homonyms, or sound similar, in ways that almost always end up being hilariously punny"
stormagnet says, "but totally accidental"
Crag says, "you're a natural!"
stormagnet takes a bow
stormagnet says, "Machiko seems to get a kick out of the way I watch tv"
stormagnet says, "with the calling plot points, or putting lines in characters mouths, etc"
Crag says, "MST3K"
stormagnet says, "yup"
Crag says, "I love that"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "I was trying to find a clip of that thing I wanted to show you on YouTube"
Crag says, "yeah?"
stormagnet says, "and got a hit of the clip from Lucky Star"
stormagnet says, "confirming my suspicion that yep, they *were* referencing it"
Crag laughs
stormagnet looks for a clip of the actual act
stormagnet says, "there's a LOT of imitation clips"
stormagnet says, "damn, apparantly the lawyers are really going after these clips"
Crag says, "fuckers"
stormagnet says, "I've gotten a lot of "no longer available due to a copyright claim" pages"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "ok, closest I've found so far is some anime techno remix video using footage from the act"
stormagnet says, "which really isn't the same"
Crag says, "aw well"
stormagnet sighs
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "I'm actually a little pissed at how thoroughly they've been scoured"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "ooh!"
stormagnet says, "I think I got one"
Crag?
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "it's not youtube"
stormagnet says, "it's real player"
Crag says, "I might be able to get it to work anyway"
stormagnet says, "which is ass, but if it's really in  here, it'll work"
stormagnet says, "I'm still watching to see if it's in here"
stormagnet says, "it's a 15 minute clip"
stormagnet says, "well, he shows up"
stormagnet says, "there's a debate on recycling"
stormagnet says, "he's here"
stormagnet says, "I don;t know if the act is included, or if it's just the character showing up"
stormagnet tries fast-forwarding a bit
stormagnet says, "I can't believe I was even bothering to listen to this debate"
stormagnet says, "since it's kind of crap["
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I think I'm in the "sonna no kankei ne!""
stormagnet says, "camp"
Crag says, "What's that mean?"
stormagnet says, "which means, loosely translated, "there's no relationship""
stormagnet says, "that's besides the point"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "but in a rude, slang way"
stormagnet says, "ooh"
stormagnet says, "yup, he comes out at the end"
stormagnet says, "I found one that works!"
stormagnet says, "he's making fun of them"
stormagnet says, "that's besides the point! is pry the best translation"
stormagnet javascript:w=window.open('http://www.tvbreak.jp/channel/embed/embedprg.asp?id=49064','','scrollbars=yes,Width=350,Height=350');w.focus();

stormagnet http://kojimayoshiotube.blog.shinobi.jp/
stormagnet says, "click the link with the 'new' flag next to it"
Crag says, "Taking a look..."
stormagnet says, "and the video will come up in a new window"
stormagnet says, "fast forward"
stormagnet says, "bwah"
Crag says, "I think it's not going to work for me on account of being on linux on amd64"
stormagnet says, "and at the end of this long stupid debate, they fail to come to ANY conclusion"
stormagnet says, "their conclusion is that people are really thinking about the environment"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "how very Japanese"
stormagnet says, "it should work if you have the real plugin"
stormagnet tried so hard to find that link
stormagnet says, "FOR YOOOUUUUU"
Crag says, "aww!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I appreciate the effort!"
stormagnet says, "can't you use windows at work or something?"
stormagnet says, "it's theoretically work-safe"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'll email myself the link"
stormagnet says, "though I must warn you, a good chunk of the humor is that the guy is in a speedo"
Crag says, "That's ok"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet tries to remember that we are talking about *WDIG*, after all
Crag says, "at DIG, "work-safe" doesn't have the usual meaning"
stormagnet . o O ( home of the 'sexual harrassment' video )
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "OMG"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I don't think I told you about Jennifer getting pranked"
stormagnet says, "?!"
Crag says, "She was out of the office a couple of days for something and some of the guys on our team covered her office in pictures of David Hasslehoff"
Crag says, "Some speedo pictures, some disco garb, etc"
stormagnet says, "bwah!!!"
Crag says, "She left it up for several days!"
Crag says, "She seemed to enjoy the attention :)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "She kept bringing people buy to show it off"
Crag says, "Er, by"
stormagnet says, "after all the trouble they went to for such an elaborately awesome prank, one has to respect the effort"
Crag . o O ( bringing people buy - a new shopping method )
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "They were going to try to print a really LARGE picture, but they ran into interference using the plotter"
stormagnet says, "ok, I seriously have to finish watching this, so I can start studying"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I've spent WAY more time chilling than I planned to ^_^;;"
Crag grins
Crag <- bad influence
stormagnet says, "WTF?"
stormagnet says, "they subbed okonomiyaki as Japizza"
stormagnet says, "that's going too far!!!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "oh! I think I can get the video to play afterall!"
Crag says, "I just didn't try hard enough"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "gambare, Miyuki!"
stormagnet says, "I would totally go to your History of Paulownia Cabinets exhibit!"
stormagnet says, "YAY!!!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "it won't let me skip forward though"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'll just let it play I guess"
stormagnet says, "I was going to explain Zuka"
stormagnet says, "but I think the costumes pretty much explain themselves"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Japan is weird!"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "I take it you saw it, then"
stormagnet says, "That was one of the first things I saw on TV here"
stormagnet says, "right after sumo and a children's show teaching the bows for tea ceremony"
stormagnet says, "it was like, "Yep. I'm in Japan. I believe it now.""
Crag says, "weird!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "and it keeps. showing. up. EVERYWHERE"
stormagnet says, "the lines in between where he makes fun of the people on the show change everytime, but the basic routine is fixed."
Crag says, "SO WEIRD"
Crag says, "The male host looks like he wants to cry or something?"
stormagnet snickers
stormagnet says, "that because he got OWNED"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "What is the serious discussion afterwards?"
stormagnet says, "dude basically called him on being too spineless to ever come to a conclusion, even though it's a DEBATE show"
stormagnet says, "dude pretending he can comne to a conclusion"
stormagnet says, "trying to save face"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "fails, in my book, but they all pretend that saying that the debate "illustrated how seriously people are considering the enviornment problem" was an actual conclusion"
stormagnet says, "and he took damn long enough to even come up with that"
stormagnet says, "O.W.N.E.D."
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "so... what is this show?"
Crag says, "And who is the speedo guy?"
Crag says, "I mean... wtf? :)"
stormagnet says, "and there were huge logical fallacies in both sides' arguments"
stormagnet says, "that's the dude who always does that act"
stormagnet says, "Oshima Yoshio"
stormagnet says, "he shows up freaking EVERYWHERE"
Crag says, "He always does that on that show?"
Crag says, "Oh, he shows up on lots of shows?"
stormagnet says, "it's a very popular running gag right now"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "weird!"
stormagnet says, "that's kind of how Japanese tv works"
stormagnet says, "there's a bunch of shows, and they serve as host formats for a rotating crew of 'talent'"
Crag says, "reminds me a little of the Jon Stewart on Crossfire thing"
stormagnet says, "or 'geinoujin'"
stormagnet says, "whoever's popular at the time"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "interesting"
Crag . o O ( and weird! )
stormagnet says, "so the same people show up on show after show after show"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "very"
Crag says, "Seems like that debate show would be really boring without the visiting comedian"
stormagnet says, "if it's a narrative show, like a drama, of course it's different"
stormagnet says, "but then the characters in drama tend to be played by 'talents'"
stormagnet says, "and serves to debut new ones"
stormagnet says, "yup"
stormagnet says, "it was crap"
stormagnet says, "I actually watched some, and it was just stupid"
stormagnet says, "of course, recycling in Japan is prety fucked anyway"
stormagnet says, "it's an example of how Japan tends to self-sabotage by doing things in an overly-complicated and half assed way"
stormagnet says, "like, recycling is only available for a tiny portion of materials that are actually recyclable"
Crag says, "reminds me of work"
stormagnet says, "and the procedure for recycling them is so absurdly complicated it's no wonder everybody gives up and just chucks everything in 'non-combustible garbage'"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh!  They made fun of the complicated recycling system in Hayate no Gotoku!"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I won't spoiler it for you though :)"
stormagnet says, "thankee!"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "I should really study"
stormagnet says, "and get some food"
stormagnet says, "but I can chat a little in the process"
Crag says, "I'll be here if you need a break :)"
stormagnet says, "maybe set myself checkpoints at which I can watch *one* episode of something"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "one more thing I'm really looking forward to about that kotatsu"
stormagnet says, "it has more surface area than my current coffee table"
stormagnet says, "which equals more room to spread out my studying supplies"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I'm putting the complete Nodame Cantabile in for-stormy"
Crag pfft
Crag says, "no wonder it reminds me of Honey and Clover, it's the same director"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "I'm looking forward to it!"
Crag says, "It's good"
stormagnet says, "I've earned a break now, too"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "So I'll go run and grab some dinner from the combini"
stormagnet says, "you should tell me what to watch first when I get back, ok?"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "stink wave!"

Total: 2 people, 1 of whom has been active recently.
Crag says, "I might not stay up all night after all."
Crag says, "But I'll wait 'till you get back before deciding. :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet returns!
stormagnet says, "I ran out of cash, so I had to find an ATM before I could buy foods"
stormagnet >_<
stormagnet curses Japan's expensiveness
Crag says, "ahh"
stormagnet says, "even though I'm trying to keep it cheap, and getting treated a lot by Machiko"
Crag says, "I understand"
stormagnet says, "it's still costing me over $100 a week to feed myself"
stormagnet says, "depressing"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "Er, that's what I've budgeted for myself"
Crag says, "Actually $140 a week.  $20 a day.  Two $10 meals."
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "well, I'll stop feeling guilty about it then"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "Yeah!"
Crag says, "So which shows do you have copied to your laptop already that you haven't watched yet?"
stormagnet says, "but I had hoped to live a little cheaper, so that I could work enough hours to cover my expenses"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "good point, that"
stormagnet says, "not many"
stormagnet says, "due to HD limitations"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "still have some Potemayo, and unwatched Nana"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of afraid to end Nana though"
Crag says, "I still haven't watched those Nana episodes either"
stormagnet says, "I have some Ultimate Girls"
stormagnet says, "and Animal Crossing"
Crag says, "I've already forgotten what Ultimate Girls is about, heh."
stormagnet starts other stuff copying now
stormagnet says, "oh wait"
stormagnet says, "I have some Hayate no Gotoku, too"
Crag says, "Ah!"
Crag says, "That's a good one."
stormagnet says, "I take it we have a winner?"
Crag says, "VERY light watching"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "depends"
Crag says, "If you wanted to watch something together, we'd have to go with Nana"
Crag says, "But if you don't mind me being 20+ episodes ahead of you, Hayate no Gotoku is a great show."
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I'll watch the Hayate"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I need light watching"
Crag says, "It's not at all demanding"
stormagnet says, ""ok :)"
Crag says, "Very little real story, very funny, etc. :)"
stormagnet says, "studying is straining my brain enough"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I remember ultimate girls now (having watched a few seconds of the opening)"
Crag says, "It is also very silly and undemanding"
Crag says, "But much lower quality than Hayate no Gotoku"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "ok, I'll watch the Hayate"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet hugs and smooches goodnight
Crag says, "I'll go to bed after your break is done :)"
stormagnet says, "I can't believe you're still awake NOW!"
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet watches
Crag says, "I slept a lot after I got home"
Crag says, "I fell asleep in the bath twice"
Crag says, "And decided I could sleep better in bed"
Crag says, "and I did"
stormagnet says, "goodness!"
stormagnet says, "that's a hell of a hangover"
Crag says, "I didn't get much sleep the night before"
Crag brb, potty :)
stormagnet says, "goodness"
stormagnet says, "I'm sensing a serious butler theme"
stormagnet says, "lots of ass-kicking butlers"
stormagnet says, "and one theoretically smelly one"
Crag back
stormagnet says, "I love the exploitation of the exposition stick"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "You're basically going to adore the whole series."
Crag . o O ( basically )
stormagnet says, "I'm loving it already"
Crag grins knowingly!
stormagnet says, "the narrator is totally the dad cat from Azumanga Daioh"
Crag says, "Oh!  Yes!"
stormagnet says, "complete with mixture of crazy foreign accent and classical Japanese"
stormagnet loves
Crag says, "The voice actor has a LONG rap sheet"
Crag says, "Yes!  You called it."
Crag says, "He is credited with the voice of Chiho's Dad, whom we know to be the same as the cat :)"
Crag says, "Er, Chiyo"
Crag says, "I knew he sounded familiar.  You saved my sanity :)"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "they're bleeping out famous stuff again!"
stormagnet <3
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "They do that ALL the FREAKING TIME!  Sometimes I know what stuff is (Gundam comes up a lot), but I'm totally in the dark about a lot of it"
stormagnet says, "AND he's a dad again!"
stormagnet says, "and the name cinches it, that he's supposed to be a foreigner"
Crag says, "The narrator?"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "Klaus-san = narrator = chiyo's 'otosan'"
stormagnet says, "this rocks"
Crag says, "Oh, I didn't realize he was Klaus too"
stormagnet says, "OH"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "combat butler = hayate no gotoku"
stormagnet says, "the Japanese does not remotely match the English"
stormagnet says, "no gotoku = just like"
stormagnet says, "so he's 'just like hayate'"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I wonder if they're making fun of the Disney show, "That's so Raven!""
Crag says, "That's so Hayate!"
stormagnet says, "except his name means hurricane"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "it's a common boy's name, but... yeah"
stormagnet says, "No"
stormagnet says, "Gotoku is a classical Japanase term"
stormagnet says, "and it's pretty common"
stormagnet says, "in titles and proverbs and quotes and such"
stormagnet says, "it's a normal sounding anime title- it just doesn't correspond at all to how they translated it"
stormagnet says, "which makes sense, as it wouldn't translate well"
Crag says, "AnimeNewsNetwork says Klaus's voice != the narrator"
Crag says, "But they've been wrong before :)"
stormagnet says, "but I could see the Disney title being somewhat Japan inspired"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "hard to say"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "they sound very similar to me"
stormagnet says, "anyway, on with the show!"
Crag says, "totally :)"
Crag says, "I'm watching episode 29"
Crag says, "Japan is so weird"
Crag says, "You should definitely grab the Nodame Cantabile directory next, and check out the "Allegro Cantabile" video..."
Crag says, "all I can say is, Japan is weird."
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet could watch *one* more
stormagnet . o O ( it wouldn't too to get too worn out to study any more, right? )
stormagnet . o O ( right? )
stormagnet nods to herself
stormagnet . o O ( breaks are important for the brain! )
stormagnet . o O ( as are sweets! )
stormagnet . o O ( what have glucose! )
Crag says, "the allegro video is short"
stormagnet . o O ( for hungry... brains )
stormagnet downloads
Crag grins.
Crag says, "short... and weird."
Crag says, "The ANN anime encyclopedia totally has the voices of Nagi and Hayate backwards"
Crag says, "Hayate is totally Alfonse Elric :)"
stormagnet says, "it is not to be trusted, clearly"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "they pry messed up the dad, too!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet watched the Allegro Cantabile video
stormagnet says, "ELO lives!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Kinda, yeah"
Crag says, "But um... the ink?"
stormagnet says, "kinda?"
stormagnet says, "KINDA?"
Crag says, "Maybe I should watch it again"
stormagnet says, "that was hella ELO, and you know it"
Crag says, "I'll watch it again right now :)"
stormagnet says, "how about listening instead of watching?"
stormagnet says, "the ink was prety nuts, yeah"
Crag says, "Yeah, I was distracted by the weirdness"
stormagnet says, "er, pretty"
stormagnet says, "see, that no longer reads as particularly weird to me"
stormagnet says, "I mean, it's a music video?"
stormagnet says, "of course SOMETHING is going to happen"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "and it scans well with the lyrics"
Crag says, "I wasn't following the lyrics very well because I was so visually distracted"
stormagnet says, "getting bogged down by trying to capture on paper a fleeting impression"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Yeah, I hear the ELO now"
stormagnet says, "ok, listen to it without looking"
Crag says, "I have the window minimized :)"
stormagnet says, "then watch it again, but pay attention to the subs"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Also his hat"
Crag says, "his hat confused me"
stormagnet says, "I thought that was why you wanted me to watch it in the first place"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "the ELO, not the hat"
Crag says, "Now that I'm LISTENING to it, yeah, the ELO aspect is pretty great"
stormagnet nodnods
Crag says, "The first time I watched it I was looking for something that relates to the anime"
Crag says, "But except for being about music and especially piano, it doesn't really relate much"
stormagnet says, "I'm guessing that the guy that did their opening is a pretty major thing over here"
Crag says, "I liked that they included the chords and melody in the video.  I don't know if that was the original or the subbers' addition?"
stormagnet says, "and that the track stands alone, but they picked it up for their themesong"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Makes sense"
stormagnet says, "it's common enough, after all"
stormagnet will look for it if she goes to karaoke
Crag says, "ELO was always pretty popular in Japan, I think"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "the lyrics are pretty ELO too"
Crag says, "Now I'm watching for the lyrics :P"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I putty the people who had to clean the piano after they were done with it"
Crag says, "er, pitty"
Crag says, "Hrm.  They lyrics in the opening are different from the music video"
Crag says, "At least, the translation is"
Crag says, "Some of the chorus is the same"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet will find out later
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "oh I see"
stormagnet says, "Klaus isn't her dad, he's the head butler"
stormagnet kinda gets it now
Crag says, "yeah, I would have told you, but I didn't want to spoiler you :)"
stormagnet says, "now that I listen to him, his voice is kind of different from the 'narrator'"
stormagnet says, "but his way of speaking is identical"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "thak you for your restraint"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "that was awesome of you"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I R AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "U R"
stormagnet says, "wtg"
stormagnet says, "wtf"
Crag ?
stormagnet says, "the TIGER is narrating?!"
Crag giggles
Crag says, "I love Tama!"
stormagnet says, "and to think I wanted one..."
stormagnet says, "I like the character"
Crag says, "Best. Tiger. EVAR."
stormagnet says, "but he's Not Cute Anymore!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "that's just how he's drawn :)"
Crag says, "He's still a big kitteh!"
stormagnet says, "but.. but..."
stormagnet says, "I wanted to cuddle!"
Crag says, "I'm sure Tama would be fine with that."
stormagnet says, "and now I'm kind of thinkig... ew....."
stormagnet says, "ALL TOGETHER TOO FINE WITH IT, I'[M SURE"
Crag giggles.
stormagnet misses her kittahs!!!!
Crag says, "I am petting them for you"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "thank you!"
Crag says, "You're welcome. :)"
stormagnet says, "I love how they keep calling him poor-looking"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "It gets better too"
stormagnet says, "even though, with the long blue hair and all, he totally finds the oji-sama type"
Crag grins.
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "BOOZE CONSTELLATIONS"
Crag says, "I wouldn't have thought they could fill 52 episodes, but I was shocked when I got through the first 26 without getting tired of any of their gags."
Crag heh
Crag says, "Which episode are you on now?"
stormagnet says, "4"
stormagnet says, "I'm loving the three students that keep hamming for camera attention"
Crag says, "So you got to the part where the robot in ep1 showed up in ep3. :)"
Crag says, "They are taking liberties with the concept of continuity."
Crag says, "good times"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "and they did with the command PRECISELY what I would have!!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet loves!
Crag says, "It's raine crack"
stormagnet says, "it IS"
Crag says, "and I pretty much devoured all the episodes which have come out so far."
Crag says, "I knew you'd love it from the first 2 minutes of the first episode."
stormagnet pry will too
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "my exam studying is in danger O_o"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "sorry :)"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I also love how his cute ex-classmate keeps popping up randomly"
Crag says, "YES"
Crag says, "she's super cute"
Crag says, "hampster girl"
stormagnet says, "totally!"
stormagnet says, "omg osaka-ben"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "and now she's talking about manzai"
Crag says, "The blue-green haired teacher?"
stormagnet says, "figures"
stormagnet shakes her head
stormagnet says, "grey hair"
Crag says, "Er, yeah"
Crag says, "With the dot on her head?"
stormagnet says, "I actually didn't notice if the blue haired teacher was using any dialect, but I don;t think she was"
stormagnet says, "her sister wasn't"
Crag says, "Oh, hrm"
stormagnet says, "blue dress, maching chocker"
stormagnet says, "came through the window"
stormagnet says, "er, choker"
Crag says, "oh!"
Crag says, "haha"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "so many different charachters to remember"
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "Nagi just got pwned"
stormagnet says, "nailed as being a tsundere"
Crag says, "tsundere?"
stormagnet says, "same as Kagami from Lucky Star"
Crag says, "Is that the fiesty one?"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag says, "heee"
Crag says, "the fiesty ones are funny"
stormagnet says, "the always fiesty, bossy, and easily pissed off exterior with the carefully conceled soft melty center"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Ah yes"
Crag says, "You're kinda the opposite, huh.  :)"
Crag says, "though you're never really bossy"
Crag says, "just... fierce-ish"
Crag says, "and only when pushed REALLY far"
Crag says, "But your exterior is definitely soft and melty"
Crag says, "Or maybe that's just around me"
Crag says, "I don't remember what you were like before the BUNNIES! incident."
Crag fires up episode 6 of Nodame Cantabile because it is also teh crack
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet <- Bareta Chuu-to Han-pa Tsundere
Crag says, "wazzat?"
stormagnet refuses to translate
Crag laughs
Crag says, "babelfish had no clue at all"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I think maybe I should go to bed now."
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "maybe not"
Crag says, "I can watch ONE more..."
Crag blinks
Crag says, "The opening music for episode 8 uses the first verse from the video"
Crag says, "for lyrics"
Crag says, "heh, whatever"
stormagnet ;_;
stormagnet says, "my kotatsu"
Crag says, "yes?"
stormagnet says, "I was looking at the catalogue that came today"
stormagnet says, "it said what the webpage said in fine print"
stormagnet says, "that it was the futons ONLY"
Crag says, "ut oh"
stormagnet says, "Machiko was looking at it with me when I ordered!"
stormagnet says, "I even asked her, and she said it was all of them!!"
stormagnet cancelled the order
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I think I'm in time, it wasn't supposed to arrive for another week"
Crag says, "you'll get your kotatsu some day!"
stormagnet is crushed with disappointment
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I promise!"
stormagnet says, "I thought it was too good to be true"
stormagnet hugs
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "I need to stop relying on Machiko for language help"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I love her dearly, but this is not the first time she's lead me astray"
stormagnet says, "she's kind of error-prone, I'm learning"
stormagnet says, "hint: do not let her cook"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "or help you with homework"
stormagnet says, "she reminds me a little of the cop on Lucky Star, actually :P"
Crag says, "or the reckless teacher in Azumanga Daioh?"
stormagnet says, "totally!"
stormagnet says, "the tyimes I corrected something on my homework on her advice?"
stormagnet says, "every single time it came back with correction marks telling me to do it THE WAY I HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE"
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag says, "That's the level you're at, though"
stormagnet appreciates the humor in this, luckily ^_^;
stormagnet blushes!!
Crag says, "Good!"
Crag says, "And recognize yourself for how hard you've worked and how it's paid off"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "not that I'm one to talk..."
Crag says, "aheh"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Don't be like me! :)"
Crag says, "When you're right, you're right, and you're even right a lot of the times that you're wrong!"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "And another thing"
stormagnet says, "looks like the real deal kotatsu really are as expensive as they first seemed"
stormagnet says, "like, $200"
Crag says, "That's not... that much."
stormagnet says, "oops, sorry"
stormagnet interrupted
Crag says, "That's ok :)"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "I was just going to say..."
stormagnet says, "but it would be another $100 to shipone home, too"
stormagnet says, "eep"
Crag laughs
stormagnet waits properly this time
Crag says, "Don't worry about interrupting me, that's one of the great things about MOO"
Crag says, "Anyway"
Crag says, "I expect that not long after you've come back we'll have all our financial and organizational ducks in a row, and dropping a few benjamins on a fancy table won't be a big deal"
Crag says, "None of our dreams are out of reach"
Crag says, "Even in combination"
Crag says, "We just have to work for them and be patient"
Crag says, "And if it's only $200, I think you can easily get a kotatsu after you've been tutoring for a while, right?"
Crag <- done typing now :)
Crag says, "I can't stop watching this show"
Crag says, "so good!"
Crag says, "I'll probably finish this series today"
Crag says, "ugh, stink wave"
stormagnet says, "eew"
stormagnet damns the stink waves
stormagnet says, "I found a for reals kotatsu set for $130"
Crag says, "That's not that much!"
stormagnet says, "after checking to make damn sure that the kotatsu ITSELF is included"
stormagnet says, "should I go for it?"
Crag says, "I think you should go for it."
Crag says, "It's for studying!"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "School supplies!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "I was so looking forward to it"
Crag says, "And it will be good for your mood and stuff"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "You will be happier, healthier, warmer..."
stormagnet nodnods
Crag says, "Being warmer will increase the speed of your brain :)"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "and make my joints feel better"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet goes for it
Crag says, "AND two months of not having a co-lo server will pay for it with money left over for shipping"
stormagnet says, "it's not as pretty, but that way I wn't feel bad if I end up dinging it up a bit, either"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "And you'll probably be working soon, too"
stormagnet says, "I'm almost tempted to make Machiko chip in for leading me astray"
stormagnet :P
Crag laughs
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "You should just charge her to use it when she's over :)"
Crag says, "200 yen per hour?"
Crag says, "seems fair to me. :)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "On the other hand, she has been treating you a lot"
Crag says, "So it all balances out"
Crag says, "Oh hey, it's getting to be late for you!"
Crag says, "It's like 1:30am over there, right?"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "the one I got is like this"
stormagnet  http://www.nissen.co.jp/sho_item/regular/1710/1710_38902.asp?book=1716
Crag peeks
stormagnet says, "only the long version, and a slightly different model"
stormagnet says, "the long version is a little cheaper, and the futon pattern a little different"
stormagnet is having trouble finding the one she ordered outside of the catalogue
Crag nods.
Crag says, "I'm sure it will be lovely"
stormagnet http://www.nissen.co.jp/sho_item/regular/1710/1710_50401.asp?book=1710&cat=0&bu=0&cate009_010_001_000-01
stormagnet says, "that's it"
stormagnet should've tinyurled
Crag says, "THat's ok, my terminal turns it into a link"
Crag says, "I just right-click and pick "open link""
stormagnet says, "awes"
Crag says, "Ubuntu is the shit :)"
stormagnet nodnods
Crag says, "Watching this anime about musicians trying hard is kinda getting me in the mood to play regularly again :)"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "they have these padded futon-style carpets"
stormagnet says, "with HEATERS built in"
Crag!
stormagnet says, "daaaaamn"
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "they're like, $50"
stormagnet tries to find a link to show you
stormagnet http://www.nissen.co.jp/sho_item/regular/1810/1810_26602.asp?book=1832&cat=0&bu=0
stormagnet says, "I guess  the covers are sold seperately- so it's actually more"
stormagnet says, "but damn, that's a cool idea"
Crag says, "I see"
Crag says, "That is a good idea."
stormagnet says, "here's what I was looking at when I first exclaimed"
stormagnet http://www.nissen.co.jp/sho_item/regular/1810/1810_26802.asp?book=1810&cat=0&bu=0&cate010_006_000_000-02
stormagnet says, "they were right after the kotatsu, reasonably enough"
Crag says, "It's big!"
stormagnet says, "OMFG CUTE PANTIES"
stormagnet says, "I *knew* Japan was hoarding them!"
Crag ..
Crag says, "You just weren't looking in the right places? :)"
stormagnet says, "and they are teh cheap!"
stormagnet says, "like, under a buck a pair!"
Crag says, "wow!"
stormagnet jawdrops
stormagnet tries to find a link
stormagnet says, "I should also translate and point out that those awesome little roll pillows come with that rug"
stormagnet wishes this shit was available stateside
Crag says, "Oh I see..."

Crag looks
Crag says, "hee hee"
stormagnet says, "this is a dangerous country for me"
stormagnet says, "dangerously AWESOME"
Crag says, "it's true!"
Crag says, "I'm quite fond of this Nodame Cantabile series. :)"
Crag says, "Are you still awake?"
Crag says, "heh, probably not."
Crag says, "I'm going to stay up and go to bed early tonight and try to get my schedule shifted towards getting up at 6 on a regular basis"
Crag says, "There's a lot of scenes in Nodame Cantabile where they show musicans' hands, and especially for the piano bits I think they used motion capture and rendered it in 3d with cell shading"
Crag says, "it's a nice effect :)"
Crag says, "Finished watching the series at 3:10pm"
Crag says, "heh"

Hi Robert,

We haven't heard from Lucy in awhile.  Any news there?  By now she should
have received something from LL Bean.  Hopefully it got there okay.  I was a
little concerned, because after I placed the order, their confirmation
indicated they were sending it "Kawakubo c/o Louisa Warden".  (cringe!).  If
you speak to her, remind her to check her stormagnet account from time to
time.

I think Emiko misses her sister already.  She found an old greeting card
Lucy gave her years ago and positioned it on top of her computer monitor.

Ben tells us that he sees you and you are doing well.  It's good to know.
Take care.

Sue and Shinya

stormagnet says, "um, no- I didn't get a package"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "and I thought that since my mom had gotten mail through to my w.washington.edu account, and since I had replied from that account, that if she sent any more mail, it would be to that address"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure I remember giving her my cellphone email address and phone #, too, but I guess I'll email her those again"

stormagnet says, "I'm loving the quotes from other anime they throw in at the end, too"

stormagnet says, "is a lot of shonen anime references"
stormagnet says, "HEY!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "oh, I thought you were maving to make fun of my keyboard troubles"
stormagnet  ^_^;;
Crag says, "nope"
Crag says, "There's a lot of shonen anime"
stormagnet says, "I'm having some trouble with my SCPing from wrack, though"
Crag says, "What kind of trouble?"
stormagnet says, "the connection keeps breaking every couple minutes"
stormagnet says, "and sometimes I get error: fail to read from host"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "Checking around..."
stormagnet says, "in fact, I got a couple of those just now..."
Crag says, "I have another download going, let me throttle it and see if that helps..."
Crag says, "er"
stormagnet says, "Ihope so"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "I'm looking at the bandwidth graphs and for a large period there was no traffic at all"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "So maybe wrack or the DSL was having issues..."
stormagnet says, "it isn't resuming properly when it gets errors, so if I don;t notice"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "that would explain a lot"
stormagnet says, "my connection on here is pretty bad, too"
Crag says, "Oh no, I know why"
stormagnet says, "ergo the blind typing"
Crag says, "It's 'cause I cleaned out the uploads"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "aheheh"
Crag says, "So the graph doesn't tell me anything"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag says, "Still, I did throttle the current download just now"
Crag says, "So give it a try again"
stormagnet says, "the speed is helping"
Crag says, "And if it craps out while we're talking, it that wasn't the cause"
stormagnet says, "and it raises my chances of getting a complete copy before it craps out again"
Crag says, "The file I'm downloading has like 2000+ seeders. :)"
stormagnet says, "and sends me back to 0, goddamnit"
Crag says, "ew"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "You need a more robust syncing method"
stormagnet says, "otherwise I would have watched more by now"
stormagnet nods heartily
Crag says, "rsync will resume partials because it does block-by-block comparisons"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I guess I should do rsync"
Crag says, "You'd have to install cygwin, I think"
Crag says, "It has no pretty gui"
Crag says, "And it doesn't auto-restart"
stormagnet says, "only I'll need to do everything in cygwin loses"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But you could run it on a schedule"
stormagnet says, "and I think it keeps my files somewhere weird, too"
Crag says, "You could setup a scheduled windows job that syncs for-stormy to your laptop"
stormagnet says, "I lack the HD for that ^_^;;"
Crag says, "And then delete stuff out of for-stormy on wrack when it's cleanly copied"
Crag says, "oh yeah"
stormagnet says, "I should really get an external drive"
Crag says, "Did you check out that link?"
stormagnet says, "oops, no"
Crag says, "Need me to paste it again? :)"
stormagnet says, "SWEEEEEEEEY"
stormagnet says, "er, SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTT"
Crag says, "Exactly my thoughts"
stormagnet used screen
Crag says, "nice"
Crag says, "That inspired me to go check out HD prices"
Crag says, "I saw high-capacity Seagate drives for around 20 cents per gig"
stormagnet says, "we need that"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I'm planning on getting it"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "Instead of using DVDs for backups, I will use entire drives."
stormagnet says, "Excellent!"
Crag says, "Seagate Barracuda, 750GB, $160"
Crag says, "plus shipping, tax, yadda yadda"
stormagnet says, "gimmee a hiont: how do express a range of linear numbers in regex?"
stormagnet says, "daaaamn that's a lotto gig"
stormagnet says, "hint"
Crag says, "Er, if you're specifically wanting to match against a range of numbers"
stormagnet says, "*A* range"
Crag says, "As opposed to an arbitrary N-digit number"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Then it's tricky"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Regexes don't know what numbers mean"
stormagnet says, "regular-ass numbers"
Crag says, "They just see them as digit patterns"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "how do I do that digit pattern range?"
Crag says, "Oh that's [0-9]"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "matches any digit"
Crag says, "what sucks about matching integers in regexes is the edge cases"
Crag says, "matching 100-200 looks like (1([0-9]{2})|200)"
stormagnet says, "oh goddamn it"
Crag says, "And if they can have variable lengths it's even worse"
stormagnet says, "that's beside the point, because I can't even get rsync to go that far"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "not being able to copy is a pain in the ass"
Crag says, "rsync doesn't use regexes"
stormagnet says, "argh"
stormagnet says, "that explains a lot"
Crag says, "It uses shell globs"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "the kind of file matching shells use"
Crag says, "So the glob foo*bar == the regex ^foo.*bar$"
Crag says, "and ? == ."
Crag says, "and you can do alternations for matching alternatives like this:"
Crag says, "foo{bar,baz} matches foobar and foobaz"
stormagnet says, "I lack the time and brain power to go that far in depth tonight"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I just want to set up something quick and dirty for now"
Crag says, "What're you trying to match?"
Crag says, "There's probably a simpler way :)"
stormagnet says, "but I don;t have enough HD to do the whole directory"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "You want episodes < N?"
Crag says, "something like that?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "19 and up"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "but cygwin is a ginormous pain in the ass"
Crag says, "filewhatever{19,20,21,22,etc}"
Crag says, "that's true"
stormagnet says, "and I have narsty keyboard lag, too bhooot"
Crag says, "Also, I could do stuff to the for-stormy directory to help out if you like"
Crag says, "Like make a "next" directory containing whatever you want to fetch next"
stormagnet says, "which is making me want to bash my laptop in, even when it's not its fault and is doing it's damndest"
Crag says, "And I'll put stuff in there for you based on your english commands :)"
stormagnet says, "arrrrghggh"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "angry stormy is angry!"
Crag hugs
Crag says, "Which series do you want episodes 19 and up from?"
stormagnet says, "Hayate no Gotoku of course"
stormagnet says, "but it keeps failing"
Crag says, "I'll move 19 and up into next/Hayate no Gotoku..."
stormagnet says, "and I have to type the whole goddamn thing in each time because up arrow isn't preserving my failed attempots for some reason"
stormagnet says, "and keeerist the keyboarsd lag is killing me"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "Done"
stormagnet screams bloody murder
stormagnet says, "event not found?!"
stormagnet says, "oh, what the fuck!"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "THe exclamation point"
stormagnet says, "I used quotes!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "it..."
Crag says, "I'll just remove it :)"
stormagnet says, "thanks"
stormagnet says, "...."
Crag says, "I've also changed the spaces to underlines"
Crag says, "and removed the subber's prefix"
Crag says, "and the hex fingerprint"
Crag says, "On the directory too"
Crag says, "For youuuuu!"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet tries some more
Crag says, "My downloads are all done, so any lag is not due to the donkey"
stormagnet says, "yay, it's at least trying now"
Crag says, "One of the (many) problems with cygwin is that DOS quoting behaves very differently from unix quoting"
stormagnet says, "I got as far as connecting, only to get a no such file or directory"
stormagnet checks new naming convention
Crag says, "The path is now for-stormy/next/Hayate_no_Gotoku/Hayate_no_Gotoku_19.avi"
Crag says, "and so on"
Crag says, "Or you could just grab for-stormy/next"
Crag says, "recursively"
Crag says, "-r"
Crag says, "rsync -r thatsnice.org:/usr/local/avclub/for-stormy/next ."
Crag says, "I think? :)"
Crag <- never totally sure when it comes to this stuff
stormagnet says, "ah, next was in for-stormy"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "sorry, I should have been more clear"
stormagnet hugs1
Crag HUGS!
Crag says, "Just let me know whenever you want me to move stuff in and out of next"
stormagnet says, "ok, it started!"
stormagnet cheers
Crag says, "And I'll make sure the stuff in next has shell-safe names"
stormagnet applauds
Crag bows!
stormagnet says, "anyway, I have to get up pretty early tomorrow"
Crag says, "Yeah, it's time for me to go to work too"
stormagnet says, "so now that the download has started properly, I should get some sleep"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "good luck with work"
stormagnet ^_^

stormagnet says, "would that have anything to do with my dl's suddenly improving?"
stormagnet says, "because they did"
Crag says, "It could"
Crag says, "It definitely could"
Crag says, "Stupid router!"
Crag kicks the router in the knutes
stormagnet says, "but I'm glad they're working now"
Crag says, "yeah"

Crag grins.
Crag says, "I have been sleepign a lot"
Crag says, "9 hours last night"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm going to keep sleeping that much until I stop being tired at work, dammit"

Crag says, "good"
stormagnet says, "ahehh"
Crag says, "Next time I see you I'll rant about work some more. :)"
stormagnet says, "I found some energy drinks here that seem to help compensate a little for the loss of my blood pressure meds, though, which is something"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "and better yet, they were at my good friend, the 100Y convenience store!"
stormagnet says, "when normally, they're like 300 Y a pop"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "oh!"
Crag says, "Before we wrap up"
stormagnet says, "this is the same place I get cans of booze for 100Y"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "What's our capital one status?"
Crag says, "And can I get the login info? :)"
stormagnet says, "I just paid $50 on it"
stormagnet says, "but I was a little late"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "I thought you had the login info!!"
Crag says, "no"
stormagnet says, "it's the standard!"
Crag says, "I couldn't get in"

Crag says, "I'm REALLY wanting to buy an electric scooter.  I'm thinking I might get one after mercury goes direct."
Crag says, "'cause waking to work and back is not fun anymore"
Crag says, "It looks like Mercury goes direct on the 2nd (Thunder's birthday, heh)"
stormagnet says, "it's really good exercise, though"
Crag says, "well"
stormagnet says, "whereas an electric scooter isn't"
Crag says, "it's hard on my feet and legs though"
Crag says, "And would be even with good shoes"
stormagnet says, "did you try getting new shoes?"
Crag . o O ( oh my god shoes )
Crag says, "I didn't try"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "seriously, though"
stormagnet says, "how will you know until you try?"
Crag says, "good point"
stormagnet says, "and what are you carrying to work?"
stormagnet says, "and how?"
Crag says, "usually nothing"
stormagnet says, "than that's not it"
stormagnet says, "er, then"
Crag says, "Sometimes I bring the laptop in the bag with the laptop thingie, with both shoulder straps in use"
Crag says, "I'm just getting old :)"
stormagnet . o O ( my English is slipping! )
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "you won't get old so fast if you get more exercise, though"
Crag says, "My thumb's been hurting too"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
Crag says, "that's true too"
Crag says, "I need a mechanic for my body"
stormagnet says, "you could try seeing my doc about the thumb"
stormagnet says, "Dr. Ericson"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "he doesn't *just* treat EDS"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "he's up in Montlake Terrace, though, so the bus is a bit of a pain in the arse"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "that would kill at least half a day"
stormagnet says, "has Shea taken iver Katie yet?"
Crag says, "no"
Crag says, "And Ty hasn't taken Zippo yet"

Crag says, "Oh, ride Katie"
Crag says, "Her tags are overdue too"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "there is that"
Crag says, "First things first"
Crag says, "therapist"
Crag says, "I really am depressed, not just sad"
Crag says, "better to try to get it treated when I really am experiencing it"
Crag says, "Not when I have enough energy to"
Crag says, "I wish therapists were more like hair dressers"
Crag says, "I've never had a hard time getting a new hair dresser"
Crag says, "Hi, I need a mood cut.  Do you have any openings today?"
Crag says, "Noon would be fine, I'll see you then."

Crag says, "Nicole suggested I go dressed as "the halloween costume I didn't make""
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "maybe I will"
Crag says, "I just need a sheet and a sign"
Crag says, "That's about the happiest thing I've got right now"
Crag says, "and it's not very happy at that"
stormagnet says, "aw!!"
stormagnet says, "you can do better than that!"
Crag says, "erm"
stormagnet says, "though first thing in the morning, it's asking a lot top try and bring it to mind"
stormagnet . o O ( damn typos grr )
Crag grins.
Crag says, "yeah"

stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Phil at work was talking about asking for poo-related items"
Crag says, "he'd heard they have stuff like keychains with poo-shaped bronze on them or something"
stormagnet says, "I haven't really seen any of those, but I'll keep an eye out"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "oh, I believe that they're out there"
Crag says, "the only thing I can think of for me is porn :P"
stormagnet hasn't found the breast-enhancing cookies yet, either
Crag says, "which would be pointless"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag mmm breasts
Crag says, "You don't need those!"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "kind of the opposite, really"
Crag says, "If they saw you trying to buy them they would freak out"
stormagnet says, "which reminds me- I forgot to pack that one sports bra of mine..."
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I was thinking that about the porn"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's probably true too"
Crag says, "The best of all would be if you had both in the same basket"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I'm a go take a bath now"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag HUGS HUGS HUGS
stormagnet says, "try and have a good day!"

stormagnet idles: so dirty...
Crag home from work
Crag says, "Gonna eat and shower, back in a bit."
Crag says, "actually, I'm still here 'cause I decided to have frozen burritos instead of happy hour"
Crag says, "looks like there's another funny anime to watch"
Crag says, "Moyashimon"
Crag says, "Only one episode out so far"
Crag says, "I'll gather them up for you :)"
Crag says, "Heh, you're gonna love this show too"
Crag says, "It's cute and brainy"
Crag says, "ok, NOW I'm gonna shower"
Crag idles: I'm naked - and wet!
[Idling at 5:50 P.M. on Wed, Oct 24: I'm naked - and wet!]
Crag back
Crag says, "Ok, Mamoru-kun ni Megami no Shukufuku wo! is also funny"
Crag says, "It looks like maybe there's quite a few good shows out this year?"
Crag says, "For example, a line from the show:"
Crag | "I'll make you enjoy this so much, you'll regret being born in the first place!"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet looks forward to it!
Crag says, "And there may be a successor to Trigun"
Crag says, "It's called..."
stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "daaaaaayyyuumn"
Crag says, "El Cazador de la Bruja"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I'm watching the first episode now"
stormagnet says, "this *is* a good year for it"
Crag says, "So far so good"
Crag says, "It's looking like it"
stormagnet says, "and the subbers have really been on it- they're releasing about as fast as the episodes are airing"
Crag says, "yes!  I noticed that."
Crag says, "Like, the show airs October N, the sub is out October N+3 or so"
stormagnet says, "I'm startled by how many really recent references there are in some of the anime we're watching"
Crag says, "like DAMN"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I think... something's happening :)"
stormagnet can forgive a few subbing mistakes for speed like THAT!
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I was thinking it a few days ago actually"
Crag says, "I was looking at how many anime I'm waiting for more episodes of"
Crag says, "ANd how many of them I've only seen one episode of"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "you've gotten geekier in my absence, too :)"
Crag says, "Well... maybe"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "that's... besides the point? :)"
stormagnet hopes so, anyway
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet . o O ( sonna no kankei ne! )
Crag says, "dammit, you're gonna make me learn japanese just to keep up with your jokes :)"
Crag says, "Anyway, there's maybe a dozen anime I'm eagerly awaiting the 3rd or 4th episode of"
Crag says, "ANd you're still watching Hayate!"
Crag says, "hee!"
Crag says, "I'm gonna have to buy a big hard drive."
Crag says, "But what's most exciting to me is that so much of this stuff is so self-aware"
Crag says, "Goodby Mr. Despair, for example"
Crag says, "And Hayate of course"
Crag says, "And not like self-reference or parody is new or anything"
Crag says, "But this is the next level"
Crag says, "And of course Lucky Star goes on that list too"
Crag says, "It's like this generation of anime says, "yes, we know it's silly... now let's do it again!""
Crag says, "or something?"
Crag says, "I also like that they're integrating CG with hand drawing so much"
Crag says, "Moyashimon had a throw-away scene where the ground the charachters were walking on was rendered for no particular reason other than that they could"
Crag says, "It was great"
Crag says, "I'm actually looking forward to a giant robot anime just on the basis of its CG"
Crag says, "So far only the promo is out :)"
Crag says, "woah"
Crag says, "This one might be like Read or Die too"
Crag says, "The El Cazador one"
Crag says, "Subbing of El Cazador finished on the 20th"
Crag says, "That is, the series is complete (and I'm downloading it all now)"
Crag says, "You may have some pr0n lag :)"
stormagnet says, "goodness"
stormagnet says, "zomg"
stormagnet says, "cute example sentence has given me fresh kitty pangs"
Crag grins
Crag says, "KITTIES"
stormagnet melts
Crag says, "They are on the bed"
Crag says, "not bugging me for a change"
stormagnet says, "I seriously need a cute4 stuffed animal to come home to"
stormagnet says, "at the minimum"
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag says, "I'm sure that could be arranged..."
stormagnet says, "we're not supposed to have pets here, but I wonder if they'd let me keep a hamster or something..."
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Maybe!"
stormagnet says, "they must be everywhere here"
stormagnet says, "stuffed animals, that is"
Crag says, "I could send you one :)"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Izzy maybe?"
Crag says, "She's not very big."
stormagnet says, "MAYbe...."
stormagnet needs something to cuddle
Crag says, "Or you could just... you know... get another one."
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "it's not like I've ever been able to resist collecting them anyway..."
Crag says, "I am holding all the aminals hostage!"
stormagnet O_O
Crag laughs
stormagnet . o O ( stockholm.... )
Crag says, "I won't hurt them if you come home safe!"
stormagnet whimpers
Crag says, "But I cannot guarentee their safety otherwise."
Crag looks over at them threateningly, to bring his point home.
stormagnet O_O!!!
stormagnet says, "NOES"
stormagnet forbids!
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Don't worry, they're fine."
Crag says, "But you still have to be safe!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but no threatening!"
Crag says, "Take care of yourself, as though you are taking care of a stuffed animal!"
stormagnet says, "ansolutely no threatening!"
Crag says, "Of course not."
Crag says, "It was merely in jest"
Crag says, "I didn't even look at them like that!"
Crag says, "I was winking at them at the time"
Crag says, "Nigel will vouch for me when you get back"
Crag says, "He was barely holding back his snickering."
Crag says, "You know how he likes a good joke."
stormagnet whimpers
Crag says, "Aw!"
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "Poor stormy!"
stormagnet sniffles
Crag says, "my eyes are watering"
Crag says, "they won't stop"
stormagnet hugs
Crag continues with the hugging
Crag sighs
Crag says, "what're we gonna do"
Crag says, "I had a good day at work today"
Crag says, "at least I think I did"
Crag says, "I got some stuff taken care of that I had been putting off"
stormagnet says, "yay"
stormagnet applauds
Crag bows!
Crag says, "Tom and I are going to shut off a lot of old hardware before the year ends"
Crag says, "I think I may have to go to bed soon, I'm feeling a bit sleepy"
Crag says, "Maybe ... after watching one more episode of something"
Crag says, "ok, bed time now, see you in uh... 8-9 hours... unless I can't sleep."
Crag says, "I love you Raine!"
Crag idles: sleep
[Idling at 8:12 P.M. on Wed, Oct 24: sleep]
stormagnet says, "you do have "I love you too, Robert"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "my, that was weird"
stormagnet says, "I had started typing something when I last got disconnected"
stormagnet says, "and it got appended to what I said this time..."
Crag wakes
Crag says, "The cats were making noises all night"
Crag says, "I slept terribly"
Crag says, "And now I need to get ready to go to work right away"
Crag says, "dammit"

Crag says, "I still don't have your address. :)"
Crag says, "Also, Ty says your myspace account has been hacked.  He says it's been sending out spam."
Crag says, "I'm running out of space on wrack AND ildana because of all the anime I've downloaded"
Crag says, "Good thing hard drive prices have come down so much!"
Crag says, "Heh, no wonder El Cazador de la Bruja reminds me of Noir.  They have a lot of staff in common including the Director, Music and Character Design positions."

stormagnet says, "the sling and thumb braces from the plastic bag on the top shelf of the right-hand closet"
stormagnet says, "and, if you can find them, my reading glasses, and some of my Japanese-language reference books"
stormagnet says, "particularly, the big blue book on kanji"
stormagnet says, "and the little thin 'power japanese' books"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "Some of that's gonna be hard to find"
stormagnet says, "but if you can't find them, don't sweat it too much :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet understands

Crag says, "I don't remember"
stormagnet says, "and that the bank's OWN ATMS charge a fee?"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "and that that fee is about double the fee for ATMs in the US?"
stormagnet says, "like, $3?!"
stormagnet HATES
Crag says, "incredible"
stormagnet says, "I had to open an account to get my scholarship deposits, and to pay rent, but I'm thinking that that's ALL I'm going to use it for"
stormagnet nods
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "if there's room in the package left"
stormagnet says, "I could really use some of my tights, and some of the fabric from my sewing box"
stormagnet says, "but neither are critical"
stormagnet says, "I just don;t want to go out and buy new stuff"
stormagnet hehs
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "in fact, scratch that"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I want it, but it's silly"
stormagnet says, "it's more expensive to ship than to buy new, anyway"
Crag says, "I've already emailed myself your other list, so it's final :)"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "and I will ship the phone today"
Crag says, "wait"
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet says, "anything else?"
Crag says, "Don't ship the phone until you get the title, then you can send them back together"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "good thinking"
Crag says, "and I'll TRY to come up with something else to include to take advantage of the opportunity"
Crag says, "Oh yeah"
Crag says, "Martha was talking about some kind of body wash she wants"
Crag says, "that she can't find over here or something"
Crag says, "I'll ask her to email me the info"
Crag says, "though, for the price of shipping a liquid it better be damn good body wash"
Crag says, "Maybe I can get her to make it worth our while"
Crag says, "So anyway, I think we can pay off a lot of the capone card after rent posts"
Crag says, "There's about $2850 in BofA right now, and monthly bills are about $2250"
Crag says, "And I get paid once more before rent"
Crag says, "So if I eat $100, that's still like $1600 in the black"
Crag says, "If I'm right, we can put $1000 on the capone in a couple weeks"
Crag says, "It might even make sense to put some one sooner depending on when the interest is charged"
Crag says, "And with that said I'm going to start looking for the stuff you requested."
Crag says, "Found the sports bra.  The flexible ice pack isn't in the freezer, not sure where to look for that."
Crag says, "I'll check under the sink"
Crag says, "no luck there."
Crag says, "found the sling and thumb braces"
Crag says, "Any idea where I should look for the glasses?"
stormagnet says, "the glasses would be in a box with my desk stuff"
stormagnet says, "I suspect it's the big jumbly box that you packed for me, because I don't remember packing them myself"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I hope the flexible icepack didn't get left behind at the house, that would SUCK"
stormagnet says, "but I could swear I remember using it at the apartment"
Crag says, "I don't think the icepack was left behind"
Crag says, "If I can't find it I can buy another one"
stormagnet says, "if you can find another one at the drugstore when you go for Ace bandages, though, that would be Swell"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "but I'm sure it will turn up somewhere"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "There's like three drugstores on my walk to work"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "one right across the street even! :)"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "oh- any progress on the email blogging?"
Crag says, "not a bit, nor on shutting down the colocation"
Crag says, "too depressed, basically"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "aw!!"
stormagnet says, "that's not good"
stormagnet says, "you could get started on the colo shut down now"
stormagnet says, "send them an email, or whatever"
Crag says, "oh no, I have to move email and dns first"
Crag says, "It's all on my end"
Crag says, "I have to get everything working on wrack again"
Crag says, "Then switch dns and registration stuff"
Crag says, "Then move over all the mail that got delivered to neptune"
Crag says, "THEN I can shut down the service via their web administration thingie"
Crag says, "and I'll be going to bed soon, so I don't think I should start on that project tonight"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet needs to have a lie down herself
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "So"
Crag says, "The glasses and books"
Crag says, "I'll have to move the mountain of boxes, I think"
Crag says, "I don't know which ones are which"
Crag says, "I'll start going through them tomorrow while I'm waiting for Ty to pick me up"
Crag says, "If I find them before he gets here, they'll join the stuff I found"
Crag says, "And rather than look for the ice pack, I'm just going to buy one"
Crag says, "And I'm putting the CapOne card in the bag now"
Crag says, "Is it OK that it only has my name on it?"
Crag . o O ( did she already go lie down? )

stormagnet says, "sorry, afk'd"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "whew!"
stormagnet says, "don't bother looking too hard for the glasses and books"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "again, it was just something I thought it would be better to use the ones I already have than to go and buy new ones"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I think the name is ok"
stormagnet says, "I've used it before, after all"
stormagnet says, "and it's better than nothing ^_^"
Crag says, "alright"
stormagnet says, "I think I will go lie down now, though"
stormagnet says, "I've been a little dizzy today"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "oh, ok"
Crag says, "I'll see you in a few hours then, maybe :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'm planning to get up in another hour or so"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "though I'll have a few errands to run after that..."
stormagnet says, "so don;t stay up on my accvount"
Crag says, "I shouldn't be up then, but I'll say so if I am"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I need all the stormy I can get"
stormagnet hugs and smooches and cuddles
Crag hugggle-wuggle-fuzzles. :)
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "I knew they were going to pull a Hinagiku -> Utena"
stormagnet says, "I KNEW it"
stormagnet says, "you know, since you're watching so much anime, maybe you'll start picking up more Japanese"
stormagnet says, "That would be awesome for when you come isit in the spring ^_^"
stormagnet says, "er, *v*isit"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
stormagnet says, "Cheney!"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "also, the robot was parodying a different show biz comedian who shows up on the same kind of show they were parodying in the bath"
stormagnet says, "a certain genre of food/travel/quiz shows that is highly specific to Japan, and highly addictive to Raines"
stormagnet says, "the give away was that he said 'maiu' when drinking the lukewarm gasoline"
stormagnet says, "which is that dude's signature line"
stormagnet says, "sort of like saying liciousde"
stormagnet says, "it's inverted 'umai'"
stormagnet says, "and that dude is overweight, has a large oval face, round glasses, and a bowl cut hair-do"
stormagnet says, "so the robot parody was hilarious"
stormagnet says, "though explaining the hilarity likely does not help communicate it ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "but now you know!"
stormagnet moves on to Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "ok, point #1:"
stormagnet says, "serious Utena vibe off some of the shadow-puppet stuff"
stormagnet says, "and point #2: it is taking me forever to get through the opening because I MUST READ IT ALL DAMMIT"
stormagnet says, "and point #3: awes"
stormagnet says, "and oh, one more:"
stormagnet says, "I love the opening song, it makes me want to boogey"
stormagnet says, "and then on frame step mode it sounds like someone remixed it"
stormagnet says, "excellent"
stormagnet says, "also, I have no idea why they called it Pink Gabriel"
stormagnet says, "when it's actually Peach Gabriel"
stormagnet says, "other than maybe they failed to appreciate the hilarity of the mismatch"
stormagnet says, "omfg I love this show"
stormagnet says, "I really love this show"
stormagnet says, "I'm maybe 5 minutes in and I totally love this show"
stormagnet says, "I might have to borrow that nickname to use on you, though"
stormagnet says, "there's a pun in the kanji, too, that doesn't translate well"
stormagnet says, "supervisor is written with the kanji for 'long' and 'duty, connection'"
stormagnet says, "and 'duty, conection' is itself made out of characters for 'person' and 'string'"
Crag wakes
Crag says, "YES, I knew you would love that show!"
Crag says, "I love it too"
Crag says, "You can call me Mr Despair if you want..."
Crag says, "Or Peach Gabriel"
Crag says, "I AM IN DESPAIR!  This world of competition has me in DESPAIR!"
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad they translated the kanji in the names at the end- I was about to start pointing those out :)"
stormagnet LOVES
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "I will have to learn how to mimic the black-and-white head turning thing he does every episode"
stormagnet says, "I will call you Momo-iro Kakarichou, of course :P"
Crag says, "Ok"
stormagnet says, "oh so good"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I need a cute Japanese nick name for you"
Crag says, "I'll have to work on that"
stormagnet says, "though it also bears pointing out that 'hair' is associated with the barbaric or bestial"
stormagnet says, "ergo his upset over the character"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Everything about that show is funny"
stormagnet says, "it IS"
Crag says, "bure bure bure, sounds like boogie boogie booge, actually"
stormagnet says, "I kept having to step through things"
stormagnet says, "soooo good"
Crag says, "I did too!"
stormagnet was, in fact, boogying
Crag says, "I LOVE the changing messages on the blackboards"
Crag says, "And they never stop doing that either"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
Crag says, "So you can see how I could be saying that there's a new wave of awesome anime :)"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "YES THERE IS"
stormagnet says, "and oddly enough, I never see any on tv"
Crag says, "So I may have to buy another hard drive to contain it all"
stormagnet watches at the wrong times of day
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet will get one of those USB drives for herself this weekend
stormagnet says, "maybe"
Crag says, "Now that your copies are working maybe you could use wrack for backups"
stormagnet says, "I totally needed this right now"
Crag laughs!
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I might have to watch it again"
stormagnet says, "I was feeling a little melodramatically down earlier, and this is seriously cheering me up"
stormagnet watches another!
Crag says, "it's very silly"
Crag says, "Which one are you watching now?"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I just finished #1"
Crag says, "Oh ok"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Maybe I'll start re-watching 2 now..."
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "synchronize!"
Crag says, "Of course, with so much pausing it'll be impossible to really stay sync'd"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And it'll take us 40 minutes to watch the episode"
stormagnet says, "and it's kind of a waste to watch something so pretty in small window"
Crag says, "I think I'll watch a little anyway just to perk me up"
stormagnet . o O ( small window is smaaaaaaallllll )
Crag says, "Oh yeah that"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Did you check out the brain link I posted from work yesterday?"
stormagnet says, "oooooh!"
stormagnet says, "no, I missed it!"
stormagnet says, "repaste?"
Crag does so...
Crag | http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN2443298420071024
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeeeeettt!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "....oh"
stormagnet says, "um, that isn't actually that new"
Crag says, "oh well"
stormagnet says, "they were actually just confirming what was already a very strong theory"
stormagnet says, "those are the areas of the brain with seratonin receptors ^_^;"
Crag says, "I definitely feel like I have difficulty with optimism"
Crag says, "omg, do they change the fast text in the opening every time?!"
Crag says, "I didn't pause it on episode 2 because it had been so much work to read in 1!"
stormagnet has reconnected.
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet keeps accidentally ctrl-z-ing to undo typing
Crag says, "d'oh"

Done @pasting.
stormagnet will find  out!
stormagnet | The researchers said they examined how the brain generates what some scientists call the human "optimism bias."
stormagnet |
stormagnet | "Humans expect positive events in the future even when there is no evidence to support such expectations," the researchers wrote in the journal Nature.
stormagnet |
stormagnet | "For example, people expect to live longer and be healthier than average, they underestimate their likelihood of getting a divorce, and overestimate their prospects for success on the job market," they wrote.
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "they sound like zetwsubou there"
stormagnet says, "er, zetsubou"
Crag nods!
stormagnet loves that the subbers switched the side of the screen to correspond with the back and forth, which in turn corresponds with the twist/swing lyrics....
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I love when subbers really get into a show"
stormagnet says, "omg the credits"
stormagnet says, "read the credits"
Crag says, "oh like where the part of each charachter is played by that character?"
Crag says, "Or the end credits?"
stormagnet says, "beginning"
stormagnet says, "and yes, the text changes too"
stormagnet says, "omg"
Crag says, "now I have to watch all the episodes over again"
stormagnet says, "and the dirty-word locales of the world"
Crag says, "this is another one we should watch together when you get back"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet craxks up at the space bit
Crag says, "haha!"
Crag says, "That reminded me of the Douglas Addams bit :)"
stormagnet says, "the inability to factor in the fact that we're expanding at the same time, which is why we don't perceive it, is ICING'"
Crag says, "You may think it's a long way down to the apothacary..."
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "faster than you can drive a nail through a banana!"
stormagnet says, "genius!"
Crag says, "YES"
Crag says, "so good"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if this was in English from the begining?"
Crag says, "I was wondering that too"
stormagnet says, "mad horsepower"
stormagnet says, "I don;t think the subbers are coming up with that on their own"
stormagnet says, "but that means that the director has crazy English skills as well"
stormagnet says, "actually, this sort of humor and aesthetic seems especially prevalent among returnees"
Crag says, "Good poiont"
Crag says, "I love that they stick that guy's face in all over the place too"
stormagnet says, "kids who spent a long time in the US, only to get shipped back to Japan right in time for the mind-bendingly Kafkaesque farce that is Japanese high-school"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "oh god this episode rules"
Crag says, "'course, they all do"
Crag says, "But it's so easy to forget"
stormagnet says, "some of this art is totally reminding me of Audrey Kawasaki"
Crag says, "oh yeah!"
Crag says, "I hadn't made that connection.  I bed she'd love this show too :)"
stormagnet says, "the sinsiter/beautiful art nouveau / woodcut girls"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet cracks up
Crag says, "How far into the episode are you?"
Crag says, "I'm re-watching it :)"
stormagnet says, "the hikkikomori's name plate reads komori"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet <3
Crag says, "I'm several minutes ahead of you :)"
stormagnet says, "hey!"
stormagnet says, "not a competition!"
stormagnet says, "for that matter, you've seen it before!"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "I'm getting ready for work while I wait for you to catch up :)"
stormagnet says, "the tv was playing Lucky Channel?!"
stormagnet dies
Crag says, "YES"
Crag says, "You caught up with me :)"
Crag says, "I have it paused there"
Crag says, "I had to back up twice to verify it"
Crag says, "I also love the WHAT IF I HAD DIED?!"
stormagnet loves that runnimng gag!
Crag says, "me too!"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "the dolls reminded me"
stormagnet says, "in the end sequence?"
stormagnet says, "there's a row of statues with snow on their heads wrapped in red blankets?"
stormagnet says, "those are 'mizunoko'"
Crag says, "I don't remember but I'll watch it again"
stormagnet says, "aka the statues that women buy and place at a Buddhist temple when they have a 'miscarriage'"
stormagnet says, "they are CREEPY"
Crag says, "Ahh"
stormagnet says, "and then they are supposed to bring flowers and toys for them"
stormagnet says, "I saw some at the Zojoji and took a picture, I'll show you later"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "the ones I saw had red hats though, not blankets"
stormagnet says, "though that might be a winter thing"
stormagnet says, "and the old ones get stained by the weather and pollution"
stormagnet says, "so it looks like a row of clotted, drying blood"
stormagnet says, "HELLA CREEPY"
Crag says, "ew"
stormagnet says, "very ew"
Crag says, "I love the councilor"
Crag says, "That's impossible, how could X which I've only seen on popular TV and in newspapers, exist so close to me?"
Crag says, "This show has a lot of running gags"
Crag says, "oh noes, I forgot about the next part!  HAHAHA (you will die)"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "dudes are kissing"
Crag says, "heh, yeah, that was good too..."
Crag says, "But it's the cake that will kill you"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "I love the cake bit"
stormagnet says, "oh yes"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "yes indeed"
stormagnet says, "but the love-suice 'travel kit' really kills me"
stormagnet says, "love-suicide, that is"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "Best of Enya!"
Crag says, "so good!"
stormagnet says, "please bear in mind that the term used for this is the same as for the little 'travel-sized' kits in the drug store"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "ENYA"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "my god, he's going to have his own suicide cult soon"
stormagnet says, "he's the next manson!"
Crag says, "He's certainly gaining popularity!"
stormagnet says, "yup!"
stormagnet says, "I can understand the attraction"
stormagnet glances sideways
Crag grins.

Crag hugs!
Crag says, "THe end theme music is rockin' too"

stormagnet snickers
stormagnet says, "the hallway signs are good too"
Crag says, "YES!"
Crag says, "Boys love club, run in the hall"
Crag says, "so good"
stormagnet literally LOLs at the Dazai reference
stormagnet says, "in the library"
Crag says, "Honey Clover!"
stormagnet says, "Ozamu Dazai was a post-war nihilist/decadant author"
Crag says, "Oh, I missed that :)"
stormagnet says, "said that the firebombing of tokyo was the most beautiful moment of his life"
Crag says, "Meep!"
stormagnet says, "it's not a reference that would be funny without knowing the author ^_^"
Crag says, "Ahhh"
Crag says, "And now I must go to work"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "And tonight I'm going to the haloween party"
Crag says, "So I probably won't see you until tomorrow"
Crag hugs and kisses.
Crag says, "Leave me lots of good scroll? :)"
stormagnetkisses!
stormagnet promises!
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Sleep well, have a good tomorrow, I'll be thinking of you all the time."
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet will!
Crag hugs some more.
stormagnet says, "you can 'deep love' me anytime ;)"
Crag giggles
Crag says, "yes ma'am!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I'm much more likely to be IN DESPAIR!  THIS WORLD HAS ME IN DESPAIR!"
Crag says, "And"
Crag says, "if the living forever thing won't work for some reason"
Crag says, "we can die together"
Crag says, "but not prematurely"
Crag says, "ok, I'm off."
Crag idles: THIS WORLD OF WORK HAS ME IN DESPAIR
[Idling at 9:03 A.M. on Fri, Oct 26: THIS WORLD OF WORK HAS ME IN DESPAIR]
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet totally missed the Nietzsche joke
stormagnet . o O ( thank you, kind subbers! )
stormagnet says, "thanks for the kind offer, but I'd rather we didn't- even if we can't live forever"
stormagnet says, "I'd want you to live"
stormagnet CRACKS UP
stormagnet says, "the text in the next opening?"
stormagnet says, "an introduction to Ozama Dazai"
stormagnet says, "much more thorough than mine!"
stormagnet says, "a sample of his writing"
stormagnet says, "oh my, Lucky Channel has appeared on the blackboard!"
stormagnet says, "and the rant about returnees seems to back up my hunch :P"
stormagnet says, "whoa-"
stormagnet says, "now Hayate no Gotoku has popped up on the blackboard"
stormagnet says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "I love the 'Komori-san, present' joke, too"
stormagnet says, "and the way he's totally gotten used to being followed everywhere by stalker girl"
stormagnet says, "and that her showing up in kimono, and Kaede showing up in the Catholic school uniform, are just being waved through"
stormagnet says, "oh my, the Lucky Channel references just got awfully blatant all of a sudden..."
stormagnet says, "and that chibi-zetsubou was freaking adorable"
stormagnet cracks up and DIES over the
stormagnet says, "they're talking like psychologists thing middle schoolers talk like!"
stormagnet says, "thinK"
stormagnet says, "those keys aren't even anywhere near eachother?!"
Crag smiles and nods.

stormagnet says, "and the mom's name is pretty ok too, 'miraculous'"
stormagnet says, "though the dad's is hilarity"
stormagnet spoilered herself by just giving in and looking up all the words beginning with 'zetsu'
stormagnet says, "and I wonder if we'll ever even get to see 'enishi'"
stormagnet can't find anything for Kei, though...

stormagnet says, "thatnk you for explaining the 'peerless' joke"
stormagnet says, "that word seems to have taken on a new meaning"
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet totally missed the clairvoyance joke
stormagnet loves the manga artist parody frames at the end, too
stormagnet says, "ah, dang, that's it for what we have so far"
stormagnet moves on to Nodame Cantabile
Crag says, "Nodame Cantabile RULES!"
Crag says, "You have mail from "International Scholar Laureate Program" and "UW College of Arts & Sciences""
Crag says, "The College of Arts & Sciences one is another Dean's List notice"
Crag says, "The other one is that scam thing you told me about before"
Crag says, "pre-professional experience and all that"
Crag says, "I think I might need to get serious about replacing wrack with a freshly setup VM"
Crag says, "it's kindof a mess"
Crag says, "I might need to shut wrack down for a memory upgrade tonight."
Crag says, "I found a dimm that I think I can use"
Crag heads out to visit Nicole.

Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "the workload is WAY lighter than UW"

Crag . o O ( which isn't really studying, but WHATEVS )
stormagnet says, "Once I start tutoring, though, that'll eat into my free time pretty fiercely"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "But it will also be awesome for your studies"
stormagnet says, "I need to figure out a good balance "
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "balance is when you're a viking"
stormagnet says, "Once I get into my routine with homework, I can start adding things to the pile"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "the hardest thing to deal with is how much more sleep I need here"
Crag says, "where as I have all the balance of a deflated inner tube"
stormagnet says, "I should remember to fax the sleep med doc about getting my modafinil"
stormagnet says, "and stock up on energy drinks"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "and don't forget to keep your salt intake up"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to try and get a hoework buffer done, too"
stormagnet says, "oooh"
stormagnet says, "good one"
stormagnet had forgotten this morning
stormagnet says, "I was thwarted in buffering this weekend by the running out of schedule"
Crag says, "Sancho is still squirming!"
stormagnet says, "they haven't passed out the new one yet, so I don;t know what to do in advance"
stormagnet says, "SQUIRM!"
Crag says, "School schedule?"
stormagnet says, "once I do, though, I figure that if I just do it all in one go, I can try and keep a buffer going to allow more time for fun during the week"
stormagnet says, "hoework schedule"
stormagnet says, "HOME"
Crag says, "ah"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "ahehh"

stormagnet says, "yes it is"
stormagnet pimps her assignments
Crag says, "I need someone to do some ho work for me"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "anyway, right now my load is light enough to allow me lots of time to slack off at home chatting and watching anime"
stormagnet says, "which is nioce )"
Crag says, "on the bus back from the Udist there was a group of over a dozen hotties on the way to a halloween party"
stormagnet says, "NICE"
Crag says, "woof and such"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "excellent"
Crag says, "yay slacking!"
stormagnet says, "I will probably be shifting that balance in the near future towards work and out-of-the-apartment exploring, though"
Crag says, "Yay exploring!"
stormagnet says, "and I also need to blog more, and catch up on my independent reading"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "I can't believe I've been here nearly two months and barely been out of the neighborhood ^_^;"
Crag says, "Sancho turned around so he can PUT HIS FACE IN THE KEYBOARD (and nails)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "he must be in serious love mode"
Crag says, "You have good excuses :)"
Crag says, "yeah, kinda"
stormagnet says, "train fare being one of them"
Crag says, "He gets in love mode about every other day"
stormagnet says, "I'm supposed to get my disability cert next month"
stormagnet says, "and I'm saving my major explorations until then"
Crag says, "Makes sense"
stormagnet says, "so right now, while I'm waiting, I'm planning to build that homework buffer"
Crag says, "Will Machiko join you on some of your exploration?"
stormagnet says, "h hell yeah"
Crag says, "I assume she's still recovering right now"
stormagnet says, "but I should do some on my own"
stormagnet says, "and, ideally, make some friends to go hang out with"
stormagnet says, "that'll take some doing, though"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "I need new friends too"
stormagnet says, "but there's no need to rush things, either"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you've been doing some hanging out, though"
stormagnet says, "has the game started yet?"
Crag says, "not yet"
Crag says, "a couple more weeks I think"
Crag says, "And first session is just charachter creation"
Crag says, "character"
Crag says, "spelling is hard"
stormagnet says, "sounds like it might synchronize with my cert nicely"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Could be"
stormagnet says, "your gaming days can be my exploring days :)"
Crag says, "Game will be 11-4(ish) sundays"
Crag says, "so game time for me is monday morning for you"

Crag says, "so I'll be a little idle for a bit"
stormagnet says, "him"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet will watch some Nodame ^_^
Crag says, "well, I guess I loved on him real good"
Crag says, "cause he turned away from me and went back to resting on my shins"
Crag says, "guess I'll watch something or other too"
Crag says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I don't remember if we looked this up before..."
Crag says, "But the voice of the Murder Princes?"
Crag says, "was also non-hachi Nana and Edward Elric"
Crag says, "I think Sancho's falling asleep on my legs"
Crag says, "he just did that falling-asleep twitch thing"
Crag says, "doh, he's awake now"
Crag says, "and clawing me"
Crag says, "rar"
stormagnet giggles
Crag [to Sancho]: While I have ancestors from many parts of Europe, I am NOT AN OTTOMAN!!!
stormagnet says, "let's face it"
stormagnet says, "you're his favorite tree"
Crag says, "evidently"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "you must really be loving him proper"
Crag says, "sometimes"
Crag says, "and Marco too"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I loves them"
stormagnet says, "that's good to hear"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Chiaki in Nodame Cantabile is the same voice as Nobu in Nana"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "talk abot your polar opposites"
Crag says, "that voice actor has a LONG list of stuff he's been in"
stormagnet says, "that's some serious range"
Crag says, "including Lucky Star, Evangelion and Fruits Basket"
stormagnet says, "DAYUMN BOY"
Crag says, "oh yeah, and he was in Cardcaptor Sakura.  And Chobits.  And Kanon."
stormagnet blinks
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "and Ebichu"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "we should follow these things more often"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it really adds an extra dimension"
stormagnet watches another!
Crag says, "And Startos 4"
Crag says, "Oh, and Fushigi Yuugi"
Crag says, "And Escaflowne"
Crag says, "I'm starting to think anything he's been in that I haven't seen, I need to see."
Crag . o O ( but I'm running out of disk space )
Crag says, "I'm now going to queue up 26 episodes of 'Claymore' solely on the basis of Tomokazu Seki appearing in two epsides."
Crag says, "episodes."
Crag says, "oh, he was in Angelic Layer too"
Crag says, "he was also in Marmalade Boy"
Crag says, "And Last Exile"
Crag says, "And Great Teacher Onizuka"
Crag says, "And Fate/stay night"
Crag says, "ok, I'm done :)"
stormagnet says, "good lord"
stormagnet says, "we need to watchlist that boy"
Crag says, "basically"
stormagnet nods
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I think imdb has that feature"
Crag says, "Now I'm wondering who else we should be following up on"
Crag says, "I've been poking around"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "research!"
Crag says, "Vash the Stampede was in a bunch of other famous stuff"
Crag says, "Oh, and Mugen from Samurai Champloo?"
stormagnet says, "DAMN"
Crag says, "Not the same guy!"
Crag says, "New guy"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "ok then"
Crag says, "But"
Crag says, "Mugen's voice actor was in Death Note, Nodame Cantabile, Juuni Kokki and a bunch of other stuff"
Crag says, "All relatively small parts, but still"
stormagnet says, "dang"
stormagnet says, "on the rise, perhaps"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, did you watch Battle Programer Shirase yet?"
Crag says, "'cause that's Mugen too"
Crag says, "oh shit"
Crag says, "nodame?  She's Fuu from Samurai Shamploo"
Crag says, "ANd she was in Lain"
Crag says, "And Starwberry Marshmallow"
Crag says, "And ToHeart"
Crag says, "And she's Mikan in Potemayo"
Crag says, "And she's Mahoro from Mahoromatic"
Crag says, "So it looks like Nodame Cantabile was put together with an all-star cast"
Crag says, "Maybe the world of anime voice acting is just smaller than it seems"
Crag says, "but Mr. Despair was in Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile, Noir, Trigun, Ergo Proxy, and El Cazador de la Bruja, among others."
Crag says, "And Kanon"
Crag says, "ok, I'm done baconizing in the ANN encyclopedia for now"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I guess it is a pretty small world after all"
stormagnet says, "there are a lot of no-name anime that we don't watch, after all"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "It has to be good enough for the subbers"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "sets a high standard"
Crag says, "so this is interesting"
Crag says, "After chasing all those other "was in" things, I found someone who has only been in two things ever"
Crag says, "'The Paper' from Read Or Die was in one live action show I've never heard of (MPD Psycho)"
Crag says, "Also, she's super hawt"

[Idling at 1:15 A.M. on Sun, Oct 28: sleep vs cats - FIGHT!]
stormagnet says, "ok, I kept quiet for a couple of them"
stormagnet says, "but I absolutely HAVE to point out the pun with 'oboe'"
stormagnet says, "though 'pun' doesn't translate very well to this one- it's more a literary sort of allusion"
stormagnet says, "'oboe' means 'menory' or 'thoughts' in Japanese"
stormagnet says, "and it traditionally has a very close, romantic sort of overtone"
stormagnet says, "so when he's telling Megumi (Nodame) to listen to his 'oboe' the closing overlap is music/thoughts/feelings"
stormagnet says, "hem"
stormagnet </lecture>
stormagnet says, "also, you may have guessed/noticed this yourself"
stormagnet says, "but the war-fan prof is, of course, speaking Osaka-ben"
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't noticed any on Nodame's part before, because her way of speaking is so weird to begin with..."
stormagnet says, "but her whole family has crazy thick dialect"

Crag wakes
Crag says, "heee, good stuff"
Crag says, "That's another series I'd like to watch with you when you're back"
Crag says, "Oh neat"
Crag says, "ANN Encyclopedia has an anime comparison feature"
Crag says, "You give it some anime and it tells you who they have in common"
Crag says, "I compared Nana to Lucky Star, and found the three people who were in both and what they did in each"
Crag says, "I'm going to wait on the memory upgrade"
Crag says, "I'll include it as part of the full server rebuild project thingie"
Crag says, "Which is going to wait for me to get a hard drive to do the rebuild on"
Crag says, "d'oh, I waited too long on the LCD monitor discount"
Crag says, "I thought today was the last day, but I guess it was yesterday"
Crag says, "I want to kill the emusic subscription.  We've gone through two or three cycles without using any downloads"
Crag says, "It pisses me off :P"
Crag says, "I downgraded us to a "please don't go!" subscription of 20 downloads for $6"
Crag says, "But I just don't like the subscription model as implemented."
Crag says, "I'm going to go hang out with Shea for a bit"

stormagnet blames the monitor miss on mercury too, while she's at it
stormagnet says, "don't kill the emusic!"
stormagnet says, "if I'd known you weren't using it, I would've used it!"
stormagnet says, "I think it's safe to kill the gamefly now, though"
stormagnet says, "and they've been adding stuff, too"
stormagnet says, "though I'm pissed that they made audiobooks a seperate subscription :("
stormagnet says, "speaking of hiding in bed...."
stormagnet says, "today, afternoon classes were cancelled due to a baseball game (!!)"
stormagnet says, "Waseda and Keio are the only schools that do this, apparantly, but when they go head to head It Is A Big Deal"
stormagnet says, "but I didn't get a ticket in advance, so I didn't go to the game (or the after party, which sounded fun :("
stormagnet says, "but I went home thinking I'd take a quick nap before getting started on the rest of my day..."
stormagnet says, "only to just wake up now >_<"

stormagnet says, "and after being cooped up all weekend due to torrential rainstorms, too...."
stormagnet had Plans!
stormagnet was going to run Errands!
stormagnet was going to have Cake and Tea on her way home from said errands!
stormagnet says, "BUT"

stormagnet says, "it's still in its box, though"

stormagnet says, "but Machiko and Yoshito are coming over later, so it's all good"
stormagnet says, "ANd"
stormagnet says, "Mom's package just arrived!"
stormagnet says, "and since it had her name on it, the building peeps were kind of confused"
stormagnet says, "and when I explained, 'Oh, it's from my Mom!'"
stormagnet says, "I got the usual round of "Oooooooo" and knowing nods"
stormagnet says, "and got to go through the, "so you're a half?!" conversation again"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I swear it's a sign of how ethnically NON-diverse Japan is that they can look at somebody like me and think that..."
stormagnet says, "but it still cracks me up a little"
stormagnet says, "though that said, I can bring a few examples to mind of really Caucasian looking people with one Japanese parent"
stormagnet says, "Jane, for instance"
stormagnet says, "or this kid Akira, in my class"
stormagnet says, "who has that 'totally Caucasian but lightly tanned' look"
stormagnet says, "the girls are all kind of smitten with him, it's hilarious"
stormagnet says, "he's like an anime bishounen or something"
stormagnet says, "he was the other student into literature and psychology,"
stormagnet says, "and is also really into soccer"
stormagnet says, "joined the Keio soccer club, which is pretty hard core"
stormagnet says, "so, yeah, bishounen type"
stormagnet doesn't hold it against him, though :P

Crag says, "that's good"
Crag says, "Speaking of step things"
stormagnet . o O ( I guess my thoughts are written on my face? )
Crag says, "Your mom invited me over for thanksgiving dinner :P"
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I might go just to be closer to you"
Crag says, "It's either that or Martha or the cats."
stormagnet says, "Em's on official Helper Duty this year, too :)"
stormagnet says, "it's her first!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "My choices are... not ideal?"
stormagnet says, "I would have to recommend my Mom's over Martha's"
Crag says, "yeah, I'm leaning that way"
stormagnet says, "you should bring the laptop and hover next to the snack tray"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet misses the snack tray already!
Crag says, "At least at your mom's I'm not trapped"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "It would be rude, but I could leave any time"
stormagnet says, "that would mean a lot to her, I think"
Crag says, "At Martha's I'm completely trapped"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "They would both appreciate my appearence"
stormagnet says, "I liked bringing my study stuff to Thanksgiving with me :)"
Crag says, "tauri!  they love the fish!"
Crag says, "heh, yeah"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "but Martha's is far"
Crag says, "yeah, that's the main thing"
stormagnet says, "and last time, the food was kind of...."
stormagnet says, "weird"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "it's true!"
Crag laughs some more
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "welcome to Martha's world!"
Crag says, "and Liz for that matter"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to miss Thanksgiving something fierce, I can tell already"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Liz has a degree in Culinary Science"
Crag says, "and yet she still makes weird stuff"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I won't be online if I visit anyone"
Crag says, "If I stay home I can be online all the time"
stormagnet says, "my Mom's Thanksgiving staples may be plain, and kinda Midwestern, but they work :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "that would be a waste"
Crag says, "what I want most is to be with you, of course."
stormagnet says, "get them to put in wireless!"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "as far as wireless goes, I think I have a better shot at Martha's"
stormagnet says, "or drop a LAN cable down the stairs!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I suppose that's not out of the question"
stormagnet says, "if you bring your own cable, I think you'd be set"
Crag says, "Especially if it meant I could supply Live Raine to the occasion"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "hell, that'd be a big hit!"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "damn, that's a good idea."
Crag says, "I think that settles it"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I mean, I could do it at Martha's but it wouldn't be appreciated to the same degree."
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "they neeeeed you!"
Crag says, "You have a more rabid fan-base at your mom's house :)"
Crag says, "I'll just be a network technician, supplying technical skills on behalf of the Idol"
Crag says, "yes, I think this will work"
Crag says, "I will mail your parents tomorrow to fill them in on this plan :)"
Crag says, "BUT"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "This means you have to get up early that day"
Crag says, "To participate on your end :)"
stormagnet says, "can do!"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "it's a plan then"
Crag says, "heh, it would be great if we could get Em hanging out on the MOO on a regular basis."
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "I'm not holding my breath, but that would be the best."
stormagnet says, "they still don't let her online, I think"
stormagnet says, "It's criminal"
Crag says, "probably not"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "fuckers"
stormagnet growls
Crag says, "At her age I was trying to invent all this stuff"
Crag sighs
stormagnet double sighs
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "they squelched her but good"
Crag says, "At 15 I was talking to MICHAEL fucking ABRASH about this stuff"
Crag says, "well anyway"
Crag | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash
Crag says, "that guy"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "I asked him for advice on implementing what I later found out was a MUD"
Crag says, "It's not really his field"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "But he's the most technically advanced person I've ever met"
Crag says, "The closest I've come to John Carmack"
Crag says, "a rock star of computer science"
stormagnet was suitably impressed just by the address :P
stormagnet . o O ( Wikipedia is a Status neighborhood! )
Crag says, "Only he'd be like Michael Anthony from Van Halen (the bass player)"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Mike Abrash is still a god amongst graphics programming folks"
Crag says, "His insight into assembly and optimization was a very specific kind of genius"
Crag says, "I don't know what he's up to now though"
Crag says, "I only met him the one time, but he made a very positive impression on me."
Crag says, "He was really nice"
stormagnet smiles
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I had no idea who he was at the time"
Crag says, "Only after meeting him did I read the books of his that Chet had"
stormagnet says, "that's the best way to be when meeting and talking to Big people"
Crag says, "And then I was all OH MY GAWD!!!!"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "And I guess he's pretty human, with his own problems and stuff"
stormagnet says, "I had a good time chatting with Greg Bear the same way"
Crag says, "A family with complications and all that"
stormagnet says, "at Clarion West"
Crag says, "Yeah?"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't read any of his stuff yet, so we had a perfectly good conversation :)"
stormagnet says, "he gave me a ride home"
Crag says, "That's pretty great"
stormagnet says, "turns out he lives close to Shoreline"
stormagnet says, "and his son was hitting on me :P"
Crag says, "naturally :)"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Seeing as you are TEH HAWT"
Crag says, "Speaking of which, it seems like it's been a while since you sent me any pictures..."
stormagnet says, "oops!"
Crag <- greedy
stormagnet says, "I took one the other day and forgot to send it!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet sends now, and stands by to take another as soon as she gets dressed
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "You don't HAVE to be dressed... :)"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "anyway"
stormagnet says, "the only problem is that this game blocks my camera :P"
Crag says, "I will send you lots of cat pictures when I have the phone handy :)"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "so I have to quit it out instead of pausingh"
Crag says, "what game is this?"
stormagnet says, "Princess Maker :)"
Crag says, "oh!"
Crag says, "I forgot about that :)"
Crag says, "How is it?"
stormagnet says, "and I'm not so much nekkid as In Disarray"
stormagnet <3
stormagnet says, "addictive, as usual"
Crag says, "I like teh stormeh in disarray, too."
stormagnet says, "well, ok then"
stormagnet will take a picture :)
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "you have no idea how greedy I am for stormeh picturz"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "Not as greedy as for chatting, mind you"
stormagnet will try to be more diligent!
Crag says, "If I had to choose I would choose chat time"
Crag says, "But if I can has boths"
Crag ...
lolcrag
lolcrags are teh geedy
stormagnet sends
Crag hits refresh on email until he gets it...
stormagnet gets dressed!
Crag says, "got it!"
Crag huhuh 'member'
Crag says, "Which one is the disarray one?"
Crag says, "I like the smile in 791 :)"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "the disarray is the one in my pajamas"
stormagnet says, "but I guess my hair is pretty disarrayed in both :P"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "All I see is cute"
Crag says, "I guess I have cute goggles on or something"
stormagnet blushes!
Crag says, "srsly"
Crag says, "There's something about the 791 picture that's much better than the others."
Crag says, "I think maybe because you're looking up into the light?"
Crag says, "and a little to the side."
Crag says, "anyway :)"
Crag says, "Thank you for the pictures!"
Crag says, "And also for the chatting."
Crag says, "231 is probably my second favorite."
Crag says, "I'm only counting the self portraits"
Crag says, "The two pictures from Machiko and Yoshito are totally different and flattering in a completely different way."
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yeah, photos taken by other people always look different to me, too"
stormagnet . o O ( though I tend to think I look teh fat in them, but that's pry just the angle difference :/ )
Crag says, "Neither of the pictures I got from them make you look fat, at least to me"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet blushes
stormagnet says, "not so much Machiko's pics as Other People's in general"
Crag says, "Oh I see"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag heh
Crag says, "how long has it been since we chatted in real time?"
Crag says, "I lost track"
Crag says, "Did we talk about the halloween party I went to?"
Crag says, "I don't think we did."
Crag says, "it sucked"
Crag checks logs
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "there was scroll..."
Crag says, "damn, we talk a lot"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "12k lines since you left :)"
Crag says, "But that includes me checking @who to see how idle you are"
Another average Earth female, with rather long black hair and hazel eyes.
She is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 ideas                                   a pointy hat
 a Thanksgiving Menu                     a yar of spit
 a Butcher Knife                         a Nemesis
 a crockery mug                          an Entree container
 an Apple                                a Container of fruit

 a bunny                                 a Sandwich
Crag says, "I'm reviewing the logs..."
Crag says, "heh, we're pretty funny some times :)"
Crag finds the part in the logs where he returns from the party and hates
Crag says, "we talked in real time since then, but I didn't talk about the party"
Crag says, "SO"
Crag says, "it sucked"
Crag says, "I mean, it was probably fine for everyone else"
Crag says, "but the only people I knew there were L1(Shea, Nicole, Ty), L2(Tiffany, Katie), L3(Aaron Skinner)"
Crag says, "Where L2 = people I met recently or that night, but knew of peripherally as people Shea, Nicole and Ty know"
Crag says, "And L3 = people I'd only heard what I thought were bad things about"
Crag says, "But Aaron seemed cool enough to me"
Crag says, "Which should come as no surprise since I'd only heard about him through Ty"
Crag says, "What sucked about the part was that it exacerbated (sp?) my feelings of estrangement and such"
Crag says, "I drunkenly whined at Ty about it when he drove me home (thanks Ty!)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet approves dis array
Crag says, "And then he chastized Nicole for recommending I go (er... THANKS TY (not))"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "dis array - one k short of a raid?"
Crag says, "raid - 1024 == dis array?"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "dammit Ty"
Crag says, "on top of all that main stuff"
stormagnet hugs Craggles!
Crag says, "well, some explination"
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "Tiffany is Eric's recent ex"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Nicole had suggested that maybe Tiffany would be someone I might want to get to know better since we're both going through Major Life Changes and it might be something we could have in common or something, I dunno"
stormagnet sends fresh pic
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "I'll check the pic inna sec"
stormagnet says, "in standard Nicole fashion, I suspect she was looking to set you two up :P"
Crag says, "so the night I met Tiffany, she and Ty and I went out for coffee and pizza and stuff"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "And Nicole and Lindsey met up with us partway through"
stormagnet approves that part
Crag says, "And Ty and Tiffany spent the whole time talking about her breakup with Eric and how Not Poly she is and blah blah blah"
Crag says, "So that was about... a month ago maybe"
Crag says, "At the party Tiffany was all over Shea."
Crag says, "Which is fine"
Crag says, "But... how poly can you get?"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "Shea was there with Katie, who supposedly is Not Very Poly"
stormagnet says, "and that subject was raised by....?"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "Which subject, which time? :)"
stormagnet says, "Polyness"
Crag says, "When I first met Tiffany, it was brought up by Ty, so..."
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
Crag says, "wrong like Ty reaches new levels, maybe"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Maybe Tiffany was saying No To Ty"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "unless Nicole put him up to it :P"
Crag says, "Oh gawd"
Crag says, "no, I bet he did it on his own"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "hehh"
Crag says, "he was present for Nicole's suggestions"
Crag says, "So he probably thought he was helping me out"
Crag says, "gah"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "TY YOU STUPID GIT"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "oh, Nate and Nate's girl were at the party too, but I hardly saw much of them"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "they are kind of like us"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
stormagnet says, "low key, and tend to run off by themselves :)"
Crag says, "Nate more so than his girl (morgan?)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "also like us :P"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "so true"
Crag says, "Later in the night more some rowdier types showed up"
Crag says, "I was already pretty drunk (having had almost an entire bottle of wine, possibly more)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "and I took the sexyness of the new guests in the worst possible way: NO CAN HAS"
Crag says, "which has no basis in reality, of cours"
stormagnet says, "AW!"
Crag says, "e"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "it's just my fallback/default reaction"
stormagnet says, "I suspect the opposite, in fact"
Crag says, "ZOMG BOOBS! NOT FOR YOU!"
stormagnet says, "CAN has"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "MAYbe."
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "that night was Not Getting It Done"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "I feel better telling you all about it"
Crag says, "It seems a lot sillier now."
Crag checks mail now :)
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "mmm, I like your array"
Crag says, "you are well dimensioned"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I miss you so much"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet squeezes!
Crag says, "ok, so enough of my emo shit.  How are you? :)"
stormagnet says, "pretty good"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "aside from being concerned about your emo shit :P"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "joking!"
Crag says, "ok good"
stormagnet says, "well, kind of"
stormagnet says, "I do worry about you"
Crag says, "just come back in one piece and everything will be fine"
stormagnet says, "but I'm doing good"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And yes, this is basically what I was like before you showed up"
stormagnet says, "class is getting easier"
Crag says, "You can ask Christian :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm in the rythym of things now"
stormagnet says, "I know it was what you were like"
Crag says, "Easier?  They're not ramping things up?"
Crag heh
Crag <- transparent like edible paper
stormagnet says, "on the first MOO, too :P"
stormagnet loves
Crag says, "oh yeah... heh."
Crag says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "they are ramping things up..."
stormagnet says, "but the scale isn't really a problem"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "their 'ramping' is 'reading more in a day'"
stormagnet says, "which makes absolutely no difference to me :P"
Crag says, "yeah, you are devoury"
Crag says, "So it's interesting stuff then?"
stormagnet says, "and the subject matter in this chapter is much more interesting, and thus, much more memorable"
Crag says, "nice"
stormagnet loses
stormagnet laughs
Crag laughs
Crag says, "You won because you answered my question :)"
stormagnet says, "mostly it was a matter of getting used to the class format"
stormagnet says, "and figuring out what the profs want"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and what the tests are like"
stormagnet says, "etc"
stormagnet says, "now that I know, I can basically autopilot through it"
stormagnet says, "though I may need to tone that down..."
stormagnet says, "the prof singled me out a bit too much in the last class and I nearly crawled under the table"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "luckily, my classmates seemed pretty understanding"
Crag says, "they recognize your genius!"
Crag . o O ( and your genus? )
stormagnet says, "the girl next to me saw me going red and gave me a knowing grin and wink, which helped considerably"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag says, "that's pretty cute"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "basically, I have learned one important lesson out of this:"
stormagnet says, "I suck at geography"
stormagnet says, "Please do not ever make me memorize a chapter on geography again"
stormagnet says, "I do not csre WHAT language it is in"
Crag grins.
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I HATE HATE HATED geography when I was homeschooling"
stormagnet says, "Chapter on Fukuzawa Yukichi, the Meiji era, and the birth of Modern Japanese literature"
stormagnet says, "Hook it up!"
Crag says, "But after I started playing with computer-generated geopgrahy it suddenly fascinated me"
stormagnet nods
Crag laughs
Crag says, "HOOK IT UPPPP!!!!"
stormagnet says, "I like the subject matter, in theory"
stormagnet says, "but I hate hate hate memorizing it"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I'm against memorizing in general"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "It's a poor use of human faculties"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "We're terrible at anything that has a pattern to it"
Crag says, "It's breaks in patterns that we rule at"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "and is an excellent example of where Japan breaks"
Crag says, "Which is kinda ironic since it's the exceptions people identify as the hard part of English"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
stormagnet says, "you've got a point there"
Crag says, "Actually, I have it backwards"
stormagnet says, "it might be that learning to deal with those exceptions builds in a kind of cognitive flexibility around dealing with simultaneous rule structures"
Crag says, "because in English it's the exceptions which must be memorized (at first)."
Crag says, "Oh, good point!!"
Crag says, "I like your point better"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I was going to say that hating the exceptions is an example of not liking memorizing stuff"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "but language learning works on a different level of memory"
Crag says, "So it's not that hard to grok the rules of English because they re-enforce as you use them"
stormagnet says, "in second language acquisition"
stormagnet says, "when you're taking a brain that already has one language, and grafting another on, it resembles route memorization"
stormagnet says, "but that's just the way of inputting it"
stormagnet says, "not accessing it"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "the more I learn, the more my initial suspicion has been reinforced"
stormagnet says, "memory and language are two aspects of the same system"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "when we learn English natively, we aren't memorizing it"
stormagnet says, "it's only when you take an existing node and add a new pointer that you're memorizing"
stormagnet says, "learning unusual vocabulary is similar, too"
stormagnet says, "but once that pointer is added, you don't use memorization to retrieve it"
stormagnet says, "it's part of the system"
stormagnet says, "the explicit memory moves to implicit"
Crag says, "hm"
Crag says, "I need to finish learning French."
stormagnet says, "learning a first language doesn't make that explicit stopover"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "learning new languages literally lets you think more"
stormagnet says, "I need to reread Babel 24..."
stormagnet says, "so should you!"
stormagnet says, "and I really need to finish up and get going..."
Crag says, "well, to bring things back around, it's silly to memorize the details of a particular geographic setting"
Crag says, "It makes much more sense to start with geographic contexts and then show how various real geographies map to those"
stormagnet says, "I'll get to find out today if I can pick up meds in the PM, or if I have to pick them up in the AM, when orthopedics is still open O_o"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Happy hour doesn't start for 50 minutes"
stormagnet says, "problem is memorizing human boundaries mapped to physical topography"
stormagnet hates
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "well, it's already after noon..."
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "I guess it won't make any difference to stay longer"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "I have to take your word for it"
stormagnet says, "my fault for oversleeping :P"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "12:11 over here"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet lost track of time
Crag says, "DST coming up soon, then we're +7 instead of +8 from you"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "yeah, maybe that hour will help increase our chat time"
stormagnet says, "it totally will!"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "there goes the optimism region!  yay!"
Crag giggles
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "So other news stuff.  Marco got lots of lovies today"
stormagnet heard!
Crag says, "Hence the scroll I typed up"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "clearly lovies make him bitey"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "he was lovin' it"
stormagnet just bets!
Crag says, "I didn't mind either"
stormagnet says, "snake cat!"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad he's fully recovered!"
Crag says, "me too!"
Crag says, "And is he ever!"
Crag says, "He's in full Marco mode"
Crag says, "pouncy, chasey, bitey"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "back to being Dominant Cat"
Crag says, "Right now he's dominating the spare office chair"
Crag says, "by sleeping on it"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "what else"
Crag says, "work sucks"
Crag says, "But I got another call and email from a recruiter"
Crag says, "looking for a Solaris admin"
Crag says, "And it's not a contract position"
Crag says, "So we'll see"
stormagnet says, "oh ho"
Crag says, "Now that I know I want to work for Sun, I'm especially interested in Solaris work"
Crag says, "Had lunch with almost the whole PLAT team today.  Brian and Jim were in full-on bitch-about-work mode"
Crag says, "Brian and I admitted that we're burnt out"
Crag says, "Jim's not yet, but he will be in a few months."
Crag says, "And Brian asked if we talk to Jennifer about it"
Crag says, "I said, "Of course, and she agrees""
Crag says, "ANd Jim said, "Oh you should hear our one-on-ones""
Crag says, "But the upshot was that both Jim and I got a "there's nothing I can do" from her"
Crag says, "which is true, of course"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "But it leaves us at the same point: burnout"
Crag says, "SO"
Crag says, "there's that."
Crag says, "The team split might go live Wednesday"
stormagnet says, "hoo boy"
Crag says, "Which would mean my on-call rotation would be 4 weeks but I would only get calls for stuff I own plus advertising systems and media platforms"
Crag says, "No more calls about commerce or data warehouse systems"
Crag says, "which would be a slight improvement"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hopes so!
Crag says, "I think Jim and I may collaborate on some workflow documentation and improvements"
stormagnet says, "it'll pry be messy at first, though"
Crag says, "oh yes"
Crag says, "very messy"
stormagnet puts on her cheerleading costume
Crag pants
Crag says, "HAWT"
Crag says, "er"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "go go, oen-dan"
stormagnet says, "let's get cherry pie!"
Crag says, "For FY08 my productivity goal is to improve team workflow and my development goal is to give some classes at work"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "oh baby baby freeeeze!"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I might have to listen to that RIGHT NOW"
Crag says, "yes, I do"
stormagnet was totally amused by the translation difficulties on that one
Crag plays it while MOOing
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "motte itte saigo ni warachau no ha watashi no ha-zu"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "sera fuku dakara desu ketsuron!"
Crag says, "bob bon cheerleaders, let's get cherry pie?"
Crag . o O ( do they know... er... yes, they probably do. )
stormagnet says, "cheerleaders = oendan"
stormagnet grins
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "EXCEPT"
stormagnet says, "for some reason, they apply 'cherry' to guys here, too"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Surely not cherry pie though."
Crag says, "Cherry... popsicle?"
Crag says, "Or..."
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "couldn't say"
Crag says, "best not to think about it too much, I think"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "as with so many Japanese things"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "other news"
Crag says, "the dishwasher is still not fixed"
stormagnet says, "WEAK"
Crag says, "They lost my request :)"
Crag says, "A guy came by yesterday to look at it, but decided to wait for David's input"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "so it goes..."
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "This guy is new"
Crag says, "Only been working here a couple weeks, and only part time"
Crag says, "He's a student"
stormagnet sympathizes

Crag says, "I moved all the plastic bags to places Sancho couldn't sit on them"
stormagnet LAUGHS

Crag says, "no"
Crag says, "Different bags"
stormagnet says, "?"

Crag says, "I'm just hangin' out 'till you do"
Crag says, "I may be deluding myself (again), but..."
Crag says, "It looks like our finances are in much better shape this month."
Crag says, "The rent check hasn't hit yet, but I have another paycheck coming tomorrow night."
Crag says, "I finally got that $300 from Shea that I lent him a year and a half ago"
Crag says, "So BofA is showing $2671"
stormagnet says, "that would certainly help :P"
stormagnet says, "good for Shea!"
Crag says, "And that's after insurance and phone bill"
stormagnet says, "w00t!!"
stormagnet says, "we could totally pay off the CapOne card"
Crag says, "Maybe"
stormagnet says, "that's awesome"
stormagnet says, "or most of it"
stormagnet says, "whatever"
Crag says, "We should pay it way down at least"
stormagnet says, "I use that as a financial benchmark :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But not run BofA below $1000"
stormagnet says, "and I'm going to need that card a lot, since ATMs in Japan are so @$%%#@@! useless"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but I submitted my work permit paperwork"
Crag says, "yay!"

Crag says, "I'm excited 'cause I think you're going to enjoy tutoring"
Crag says, "yes?"
stormagnet says, "if I get approbed at Level 2, I might even be getting that monthly government stipend"
Crag!
stormagnet says, "which will help the cause a bit"
stormagnet says, "it's equivilant to about $150 US "
stormagnet says, "I don;t know if I'll get it, though"
Crag says, "oh well, we'll see"
stormagnet says, "but that will help the 'damn food's expensive' cause :)"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet has been eying some reference books lately, too, but will keep herself in check until she has an income :)
Crag grins.
stormagnet ^_^

stormagnet idles: dreaming about boooooooooooooooooooooooks
Crag idles: wakin' up is hard to do
[Idling at 7:51 A.M. on Tue, Oct 30: wakin' up is hard to do]
Crag says, "Heh, there's a Jello Biafra line in a CD Phil lent me that I like:"
Crag | The comfort you demanded is now mandatory!
Crag says, "Hayate no Gotoku! 31 will probably be done downloading by the time you wake up"
Crag says, "Speakeasy is doing maintenance that will take us down next Tuesday from 1-5am, or 5-9pm your time.  Or maybe 6-10, I can't remember when we fall back."
Crag says, "It's in for-stormy/Hayate no Gotoku!"
Crag says, "I didn't normalize the filename this time."
Crag has a bit of a lie-down now.
Crag says, "May be back on later, dunno"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "yay Hayate no Gotoku!"
stormagnet says, "are you still awake?"
stormagnet is having a lunch break
stormagnet says, "and in other news, the cake shop by the East Gate is Freaking Delicious"
stormagnet says, "but should include forks with their take out boxes, dammit"
stormagnet got kind of messy ^_^;
stormagnet says, "a prof here who is also suffering from illness and joint problems, of a politely unspecified nature (I think, from the looks of it, some kind of cancer) has been acting as a sort of advisor/liason in all things Chronic Illness"
stormagnet says, "such as stepping in on my behalf when a different prof was going after me for being absent too much (all of twice, by the way) due to illness"
stormagnet says, "and recommeneding Japanese equivalents of such products as the infamous Ace Bandages and hot packs"
stormagnet says, "anyway, she did me the favor today of teaching me the Japanese word for 'lap blanket'"
stormagnet says, "which, to my benefit, are apparantly much more popular here- not just among those in wheelchairs, but people in general"
stormagnet says, "so I was able to find some cheap ones online, solving one of my major 'dammit I want my sewing supplies' problems"
stormagnet says, "ie: crap, my lap is turning into a puddle"
stormagnet says, "so, yay!"
Crag wakes
Crag says, "cakey! cakey!"
Crag says, "yay lap blanket!"

Crag says, "they seem to have fixed the thing in mlDonkey where torrent URLs didn't work unless they ended in '.torrent'"
Crag says, "But as a bonus I found out I can drop torrent files (of any file name) in mldonkey/torrent/incoming, and within 60 seconds they will be added to the queue"
Crag says, "So now when I want to queue up ALL of the files for some show "blah" on some site, I can do some clever scripting like"
Crag | GET http://a.scarywater.net/foosubs/ | grep blah | grep XviD | sed 's/.*href="/http:\/\/a.scarywater.net\/foosubs\//; s/".*//' | xargs -n 1 wget
Crag says, "Which in english is 'fetch all the XviD torrent links for anime blah'"
Crag says, "from subbing team 'foosubs' at scarywater"
Crag says, "Doesn't matter if whether they include those 32bit hex hashes in the filenames or not"
Crag says, "Also, the donkey has a feature where it will ignore torrents it has already seen, as remembered in mldonkey/torrents/old"
Crag says, "And if I want to re-download something I've deleted, I can move its .torrent file from old to incoming"
Crag says, "god I love unix"
Crag says, "Heh"
Crag says, "If there were a religion that worked like unix, that's the church I'd want to join"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Marco just remembered something very important he had to do in the sleeping nook.  He had some urgent shelf scratching he'd forgotten about."
Crag says, "It was pretty funny.  He made the little 'mrow' sound he makes when I startle him with petting (which I had not done this time .. yet), jumped out of the office chair (causing it to spin a little) and ran off.  Then I heard the scratching sound."
Crag says, "Now he's wandered back into the main area.  At first he was looking around like, "now... where was I?  What was I doing...""
Crag says, "And then he started harassing Sancho, and now he's wandering around like he's making the rounds."
Crag says, "CRAZY CATS!"
Crag says, "I'm gonna try out gnucash"
Crag says, "I'll let you know how it goes."
Crag quotes the tutorial: "If your financial records

Crag says, "I moved $499.81 into the savings account to a) give myself a feeling of accomplishment and b) make that $0.19 feel less lonely."
Crag says, "Also, I'm going to make a small-ish payment on the CapOne"
Crag says, "I paid $129.93 to bring the balance to an even $1000 :)"
stormagnet says, "SWEET!"
stormagnet approves all of the above
stormagnet says, "though I used the CapOne earlier to get those lap blankets"
stormagnet says, "which may or may not have posted yet :P"
stormagnet says, "GnuCash sounds good :)"
stormagnet says, "I miss the kitties a lot"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "esp[ecially Siamese Mode :P"
Crag says, "The kitties send their love"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "their love sounds like grooming themselves"
stormagnet says, "I stopped by the pet store on the way home from class"
stormagnet says, "I petted puppies"
Crag says, "YAY!"
stormagnet says, "and bought a treat to feed them :)"
Crag says, "I'm sure they liked that"
stormagnet says, "then I went to a cafe and had a piece of pumpkin cheesecake"
stormagnet says, "and ated it while doing homework"
Crag says, "wow, sounds like a pretty good day all around"
stormagnet says, "and then I put together the kotatsu"
stormagnet says, "All By Myself"
Crag says, "wow!"
stormagnet says, "a very fruitful day :)"
Crag says, "huzzah!"
Crag says, "kotatsu!"
stormagnet is sitting at the kotatsu now!
Crag says, "ZOMG!"
stormagnet says, "but it isn't switched on yet"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "'cuz it's still kind of hot"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "what're you waiting for?"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "crazy Tokyo!"
stormagnet says, "why is it 68 degrees?"
Crag says, "So I played with GnuCash and it looks like something I can use without getting pissed off. :)"
stormagnet says, "and I'm not even trick or treating!"
Crag says, "68... sounds nice"
Crag says, "It's pretty cold here now as you can guess"
stormagnet says, "actually, if I were, I bet it would be all cold and wet and perfect for kotatsu breaking-in"
Crag says, "Highs in the 50s"
stormagnet says, "I bet!"
stormagnet says, "yay GnuCash!"
stormagnet says, "I bet it's a better version of Quicken by now"
Crag says, "It looks like it might be"
Crag says, "I'm kinda pleased that it's based on double-entry accounting because now I get to use my knowledge of double entry"
Crag says, "which I gained in '93"
Crag says, "for that accounting programming job I did"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I spent almost that whole year trying to grok double entry"
Crag says, "and now it's finally paying off"
stormagnet says, "eeeeexxxcllent"
Crag says, "So, leave the accounting to me!"
stormagnet will!
stormagnet says, "with pleasure :)"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "There's no good news on the LCD monitor front."
stormagnet says, "and I will now look to you for budgetary allowance before purchasing anything"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "I got my form to take to the city office today"
stormagnet says, "so I should be able to work soon :)"
Crag says, "are you excited?"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet will tutor at her KOTATSU!
Crag says, "right on"
Crag says, "Is it pretty typical to have students come to you?"
Crag says, "I hadn't really thought about it :)"
stormagnet says, "somewhat"
stormagnet says, "it's more common to go to them, but not by that much"
Crag says, "It ought to lend you some credibility to be living in a teacher's dorm"
stormagnet laughs & nods
Crag says, "Where better to go for tutoring"
Crag says, "I'm looking forward to your tutoring stories."
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I had an idea on how I'm going to start writing the story about painting magic again"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I decided that the Significant Detail that made it work before was the anacronism"
Crag says, "Drawing a forest/river scene while sitting at a cafe or in an apartment, for example"
Crag says, "So in the story my char will have had a dry spell until he realizes that"
Crag says, "And then he will draw himself a Lay-Z-Boy to charge himself with"
Crag says, "And he will draw it as a two-way drawing so he's not worried about getting trapped."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "so I should have some new material to share in a few days"
Crag says, "as well as filling in all the story from when I first started it"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet looks forward to reading it!
Crag says, "the monitor cable has been behaving itself for a while now"
Crag says, "As long as I don't move anything it's fine"
stormagnet says, "that's awesome!"
Crag says, "so my next purchase may end up being a hard drive instead"
Crag says, "So that I can make progress on the rebuild"
Crag says, "I don't remember if I told you my New Plan"
Crag says, "I don't think I did"
stormagnet shakes her head
Crag says, "I'm going to build a non-xen replacement server using the ildana hardware, "
Crag says, "Including moving all neptune and wrack services to it"
Crag says, "Then I will shut down wrack/xeny and move the hard drive into that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "so no more bridging"
Crag says, "no more firewalling"
Crag says, "no more nFS"
Crag says, "NF"
Crag says, "whatever"
Crag says, "etc"
Crag says, "Two hosts: ildana (my workstation) and the as-yet-unnamed new machine"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that's pretty much it"
Crag says, "500g drive is about $100"
Crag says, "I'm not sure whether to get one or two"
Crag says, "I also haven't decided whether to use Solaris 10 for the replacement server"
Crag says, "advantages:"
Crag says, "ZFS"
Crag says, "training (I still want to work at Sun)"
Crag says, "integrated Xen so maybe I could play with it again some day later"
Crag says, "disadvantages:"
Crag says, "it's not debian based (yet)"
stormagnet says, "get one drive"
stormagnet says, "it's not like they're going to start getting MORE expensive"
stormagnet says, "so we can always add another if we need it"
stormagnet says, "or get that disk mounting thing :)"
Crag says, "I was thinking two for mirroring, but I guess I could mirror just part of the 500"
Crag says, "I really want that thing!"
Crag says, "And it's only $50"
Crag says, "Maybe that's what I'll do"
Crag says, "One drive plus that mounting thing"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I think that's the best option"
Crag says, "I will wait two more weeks"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "I'm still REALLY nervous about everything"
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "you want to try your hand at getting money back from the VPI folks?"

Crag takes a look...
stormagnet says, "you could call Cats Exclusive and the emergency vet and ask them to send copies of the bills"
stormagnet says, "and then fill that out and send it in"
stormagnet says, "theoretically, we should be getting several hundred dollars back from them"
Crag says, "I might have a go at that"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "not making any promises at this time :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Didn't see Martha and Thunder today"
Crag says, "I think maybe because of the holiday"
Crag says, "But Martha never called and never returned my call"
Crag says, "so... whatever"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "I needed to sleep though"
Crag says, "so it worked out"
Crag says, "I went to bed at 6"
Crag says, "woke up at 11 due to CATS"
stormagnet cheers for sleep!
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet cheers for cats....?
Crag laughs
Crag says, "They appreciate your support :)"
Crag says, "So which anime are you watching now?"
stormagnet says, "homework :P"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I finished Nodame Cantabile"
Crag says, "pretty good, huh :)"
stormagnet says, "and I don't really know what to watch next"
stormagnet loved it, of course :)
Crag says, "should I make another recommendation or do you need to do homework first?"
stormagnet says, "recommendations are always welcome"
stormagnet says, "I can start it downloading while I work :)"
Crag says, "ok, let's see..."
Crag says, "I think Oh! Edo Rocket."
Crag says, "actually"
Crag says, "Do you want something more serious for a change?"
stormagnet says, "either is good :)"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'm up to episode 8 of Oh! Edo Rocket"
stormagnet will watch that, then
Crag says, "But only Episode 4 of El Cazador de la Bruja"
Crag says, "which is along the lines of Noir"
Crag says, "same music and stuff"
Crag says, "I don't think I put it in for-stormy yet"
Crag checks on that
Crag says, "yes, it's missing"
Crag fixies
stormagnet queues!
Crag says, "El Cazador also has the benefit of being complete"
stormagnet says, "oooooh"
stormagnet approves!
stormagnet says, "I'll start with AEdo Rocket, though"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I think I saw an ad for it on TV here"
Crag says, "they're both very good"
stormagnet says, "looks like it might be by the same folks as Samurai Champloo?"
Crag says, "but Edo Rocket is VERY SILLY"
Crag says, "I think there is some overlap, yes"
stormagnet nods
Crag checks real quick
stormagnet says, "oof, pr0n lag"
Crag says, "oh yes, much overlap"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "four actors and a storyboarder"
stormagnet says, "storyboarders really tell visually"
stormagnet says, "director?"
Crag says, "aparently not director"
stormagnet says, "hmm, that's a surprise"
Crag says, "And the actors aren't in major roles, so..."
stormagnet says, "huh"
Crag says, "Not as much overlap as I thought at first."
stormagnet says, "go figure"
Crag says, "Same director as Fullmetal Alchemist"
Crag says, "Interestingly enough, FMA has more in common with the other two series than they have with each other."
Crag says, "I think FMA may be the Kevin Bacon of anime or something :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet agrees
Crag tests out yet another series
Crag . o O ( chicks with huge swords )
stormagnet says, "yay"
Crag says, "I got a few minutes into it then went to wikipedia to supplement my knowledge...and I'm still there"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "Wikipedia has The Hands"
Crag says, "it's true!"
Crag says, "The art style on this show is a little weird.  I think in trying to make the charachters more european they messed up some of the proportions and angles."
Crag says, "Or maybe I'm just overly used to regular anime :P"
stormagnet says, "or maybe it's just really low budget :P"
Crag says, "Could be"
stormagnet says, "oog"
stormagnet says, "I'm feeling a little wiped out"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "I think I"ma lie down for a little"
stormagnet says, "you should go to bed too!"
stormagnet says, "why are you still up?"
Crag says, "Gotta finish this episode first"
Crag says, "I slept for 5 hours"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to go lie down a little"
Crag says, "I don't know if I'll see you in them orning"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag says, "so sleep well in any case!"
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet luuuurves you!
Crag says, "yay!"

stormagnet says, "excellent!"
Crag says, "She cackled!"
stormagnet . o O ( I should patrent my long-distance tele-hi5 transmission technique! )
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
stormagnet says, "the cackle means it's working!"
Crag laughs.
stormagnet says, "except maybe a badge would crackle instead"
Crag says, "Good point!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Don't let me keep you up. :)"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I think I did get enough sleep last night though"

stormagnet says, "it's a 75% cuddle"
stormagnet says, "but we can add juggling too!"
stormagnet says, "I'm just at a loss as to how to visualize that"
stormagnet says, "which is odd, given how tenacious (and occasionally irksome) my visual imagination can be"

Crag returns from another halloween party
Crag says, "Slightly better one"
Crag says, "I have a date with Lindsey on Friday, either this week or next depending on whether I end up being on call this week"
Crag says, "Also, Zippo is out of the parking garage, so I'm going to try to get the parking down to $70 tomorrow."
Crag says, "Katie's battery was too low to start, so she'll need a jump and I don't know where the jumping kit or its charger are"
Crag says, "So... I don't know when I'll get that out."
Crag says, "Oh yeah"
Crag says, "Reva said at the party that she wanted to clarify that she was really drunk when she was over here last time and that she didn't really mean to say "fuck that bitch".  She thought it was funny then but later regreted it."
Crag says, "I told her I didn't think you'd taken it seriously"
Crag says, "OH, more Mr. Despair came out today!"
Crag starts teh download
Crag says, "Marco says 'rubbbb'"
Crag says, "also, 'Ikea is delicious'"

Crag says, "15 more minutes... probably"
Crag says, "3 more minutes!"
Crag says, "DONE"
Crag says, "Moved your copy to for-stormy/Sayonara\ Zetsubou\ Sensei"
Crag says, "and now I'm watching my copy!"
Crag says, "I think maybe the opening is different every time"
Crag says, "I think I will re-watch all 9 episdes this weekend :)"
Crag says, "I LOVE THAT SHOW"

Crag RE awakes
Crag says, "because it turns out I'm on call suddenly"
Crag says, "The group split went through late this evening"
Crag says, "And I just found out"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Good thing they didn't need me when I was drunk"
Crag says, "That could have been a little embarressing"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, forgot to mention the neat thing from the party"
Crag says, "A couple was dressed up as The Dresden Dolls"
Crag says, "And someone queued up Coin Operated Boy on the laptop that was running the music"
Crag says, "And the couple danced to it, miming the whole thing"
Crag says, "And it was a different version of the song where instead of saying "I can even take you in the bath""
Crag says, "She says "I can even fuck you in the ass""
Crag says, "And the guy being the coin operated boy in the dance had a much more shocked look on his face for a bit after that"
Crag says, "Everyone clapped at the end 'cause they did a great job"
Crag says, "it was fun"
Crag returns to bed to try to sleep again

Crag says, "weird, paycheck didn't go through last night"
Crag says, "And rent did, of course"
Crag says, "But we still have $800 left, so weee!"
Crag checks on payroll
Crag says, "Oh, I wonder if yesterday was a bank holiday"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I'm sure that's what happened"
Crag says, "cause our available balance is about one paycheck's worth more than our regular balance."
Crag says, "SO"
Crag says, "$1900 in checking, $500 in savings, and $1000 balance on the credit card"
Crag says, "So that comes out to $1400 ahead."
Crag says, "Hopefully I can cancel car parking tomorrow and only pay $70 or possibly less this month"
Crag says, "And misc other stuff will probably come to like 400 all together, so I think we ended up with positive cash flow of $1000"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "oh, minus whatever our balances were last month"
Crag says, "But I think it's in that ballpark"
Crag says, "But in any case we're halfway to the $2k buffer point"

Crag says, "I'm going to watch anime full screen, so if you wake up I may not notice for up to 25 minutes :)"
Crag says, "ugh, I don't know what to think of this show"
Crag says, "There are cetain aspects that are annoying"
Crag says, "They keep re-capping the premise at every opportunity"
Crag says, "The art style is kinda growing on me, but it's still kinda bad too"
Crag says, "The voice acting is stiff"
Crag says, "I think I'll finish episode 3 and watch one more and then decide whether to watch any more after that."

Crag says, "soup!"
stormagnet says, "virtual soup and cuddles are nice :)"
Crag says, "made with love!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "the recipe says two teaspoons of love, but I put in three!"
Crag says, "two just isn't enough."
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "are you past the worst of your flu?  Are you on the upswing?"
stormagnet says, "I don't know"
stormagnet says, "I hope so, but I still feel pretty crap :/"
Crag says, "aw"

Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "and laptop"
stormagnet says, "and ice cream"
Crag says, "that sounds good"
Crag says, "yay ice cream!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "best remedy I know of"
Crag says, "I'm on call, so I'm reluctant to go to bed"

stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "I just know as soon as I fall asleep I'll get called"
Crag says, "conveni!"
Crag says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "poor thing!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "combini!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "It's a somewhat shortened on-call this time"
stormagnet says, "they can't pronounce 'v' in Japan :P"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "hmm?"
Crag says, "We switched to two teams this week"
stormagnet says, "shortened is good :)"
Crag says, "They did the conversion Wednesday night"
stormagnet says, "I recall!"
Crag says, "So it started then instead of Tuesday at noon"
stormagnet says, "and it was messy, as suspected :P"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I've taken ownership of converting the monitoring and documentation"
Crag says, "Because I think I'm the most qualified for those jobs in our whole group"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And I want it done right"
stormagnet says, "agreed!"
Crag says, "I've done about half the monitoring so far"
Crag says, "Colin hasn't responded to my email/ticket about how I want to do the docs"
Crag says, "I will confront him directly if he doesn't respond by the time I finish with the monitoring."
stormagnet says, "damn skippy"
Crag says, "But the group split is kinda exciting for me"
Crag says, "It's like I get to have my "no more than a year in each group" rule without changing bosses."
stormagnet nodnods!
stormagnet says, "I think that's why Disney is a good fit for you"
stormagnet says, "at least in part"
stormagnet says, "because you get to move around and try new things"
Crag says, "Yeah, there's something to that"
Crag says, "It's a large part of why I've stuck around so long"
stormagnet says, "while having the stability and benefits of staying in the same job"
Crag says, "It just keeps changing."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag sighs
Crag says, "Now if I could just move all our stuff off of windows :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "ganbare!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "fight-oh!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I've been watching enough anime that the common phrases echo in my head throughout the day nowe"
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
stormagnet says, "first step to learning!"
Crag says, "I was thinking that"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I'ma watch some anime too"
Crag says, "Maybe when you get back you should just speak Japanese when we're alone together."
stormagnet says, "soon as I get up the energy :P"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "can do!"
Crag says, "We tend to understand each other most of the time, so I'm sure it wouldn't be too inconvienient."
stormagnet nods!
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I'm not feeling ambitious enough to try to learn any of the reading or writing for a long time though"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "no need, really"
stormagnet says, "you can get by fine without"
stormagnet says, "actually, there are a lot of gaijin living in Japan who never bother learning to read"
Crag says, "I think I remember you mentioning something like that before"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "On the other hand, there's my pride"
Crag says, "I'd feel kinda bad going half-way"
Crag says, "At least on something like that"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'm not in a hurry, but I won't be satisfied just with speaking"
stormagnet says, "we're similar that way"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "On different time scales, perhaps :)"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "I'd say, in diffent focuses"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "But you're devoury"
Crag says, "NROM NROM"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "And I just sort of nurse things"
Crag says, "knowledge, skills, whatever"
stormagnet says, "both have their points :)"
Crag says, "And it seems like it's impossible to discourage you"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag says, "Whereas I get discouraged for no reason at all"
stormagnet blushes
Crag says, "ACK!  My shadow!  I give up."
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "I'm getting better all the time"
Crag says, "I think?"
stormagnet says, "we need to get you more confidence :)"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "you are!"
Crag says, "yeah, somehow"
stormagnet says, "it's a matter of practice"
Crag says, "lately I've been feeling my mortality more than ever"
stormagnet says, "you have to practice not giving up :)"
stormagnet HUGS
Crag says, "But how do I keep from giving up on my not-giving-up-practice?"
Crag [to himself]: don't you start with that circular crap
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "it's breaking out of the circular that's the hard part"
stormagnet says, "and part of that is learning how to do something without thinking too hard about it"
Crag nods guiltily
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs some more :)
Crag says, "In other news, Greg's game starts this Sunday."
Crag says, "Looks like Kia's not going to be in it afterall."
stormagnet cheers!
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "ack"
Crag says, "I know you didn't mean to time your cheer that way :)"
Crag says, "Did I tell you Kia is divorcing Nathan?"
stormagnet says, "to the game, not the no Kia"
stormagnet loses
stormagnet says, "?!"
Crag says, "I guess I didn't"
Crag says, "She decided she was done with him while he was away."
stormagnet says, ".."
Crag says, "I think the Nerdhalla crew decided to pick sides and sided with Nathan."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I got the divorce thing from her first hand, the rest I'm infering from game related stuff."
stormagnet says, "that's kind of startling"
stormagnet says, "the divorce thing"
Crag says, "well yeah"
Crag says, "kindof"
Crag says, "They both confuse me"
Crag says, "in many ways"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm getting kinda cynical"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "I'm expecting to here from her in a few months when her latest fling peters out"
Crag says, "s/here/hear"
stormagnet says, "she's kind of predictable that way"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I assume Nathan is miserable, but I also anticipate this change in his life will be for the better."
Crag says, "not that it's any of my business. :P"
Crag says, "But I feel like I was close enough to them that it's _almost_ my business."
stormagnet says, "he supported her through so much, I can't figure out why she's dumping him"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I can tell you what she told me, but who knows if any of it is true :)"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "And it was a few weeks ago so I don't remember it well either"
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure I want to know"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "but I feel bad for Nathan"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I felt bad for him while they were together"
stormagnet says, "he sunk his inheritance into that business of hers, too"
stormagnet says, "me too"
Crag says, "yep"
Crag says, "I think he's still running artspun, actually."
stormagnet says, "daaaaamn"
Crag says, "I don't know how much activity there is, but that was the last thing she'd told me about it."
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "The reason she talked to me about it at all was because she was trying to get me to tell her she was doing the right thing"
Crag says, "I refused to take a direct position"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "good for you"
Crag says, "But I didn't discourage her either"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "best to stay out of it"
Crag says, "if possible"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I wish them both well"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And, like the house, I'm glad I'm not stuck in it anymore. :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "So the current Greg's game crew is me, Ben, Shea and James"
Crag says, "With a tentative Tetsuo or Nathan at some point."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "sounds like a good set :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I wish we could get a girl playing with us, but it seems to be impossible."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I will of course relay all the exciting game developments."
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "thankee"
Crag says, "I don't think I have any other news."
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "I will watch more anime while you play Princess Maker."
stormagnet yay!
stormagnet says, "I might watch some too"
Crag says, "I'm still watching Claymore, despite my complaints"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "It's still kinda bad, but they got me hooked."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "thyis is why I finish books, even when I don't like them"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "The cats sure are cute when they're just sitting around."
Crag says, "cat balls"
stormagnet cheers!!
stormagnet says, "I miss my cat balls..."
Crag says, "I know..."
Crag says, "I miss my stormy ball"
stormagnet says, "I can't wait to send you the phone"
Crag says, "I will send you many cat pictures"
stormagnet says, "to take pictures"
Crag wins!

stormagnet says, "bugger"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to have to go to the post office and do a money order on the BofA account :("

stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "I'd seen them ani,e and such before"
stormagnet says, "but this white stick-on forehead fever-reducing paches?"
stormagnet says, "er, patches?"
stormagnet says, "really pack a punch"
stormagnet says, "it feels really nice, and my head feels clearer already"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to defnitely bring some back to the US"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "the4y have to take the train to the monster!"
stormagnet says, "because it does not magically appear conveniently in the same neighborhood!"
stormagnet says, "and, judging by their train station"
stormagnet says, "they're in MITA!"
stormagnet says, "just like Sailor Moon"
stormagnet dies
stormagnet says, "no wait- if they're changing at Akasaka, they must be a little north of here"
stormagnet says, "I can't tell from the terminal map- the 'this station' mark is kind of prominantly absent"
stormagnet says, "w00t!!!"
stormagnet says, "I figured out from the train linre they took!"
stormagnet says, "they're in Shibuya!"
stormagnet says, "my bad- that's a little west of here, not north"
stormagnet says, "I mistook which direction they were transferring from"
stormagnet says, "but only190Y?"
stormagnet says, "they must have a student discount"
stormagnet says, "wait, that doesn't make sense- they wouldn't have to transfer then"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "it makes no sense!"
stormagnet will try to figure it out later
stormagnet says, "no wait"
stormagnet says, "it kind of works if it's Shinjuku..."
stormagnet cracks up some more
stormagnet says, "I can't tell if they only had the budget for one henshin sequence, want to pretend they only had the budget for one henshin sequence, or if the other two were just to H to be shown"
stormagnet says, "her friends reminds me of Konata"
stormagnet says, "omg this show is too much"
stormagnet says, "......"
stormagnet says, "knew it"
stormagnet says, "she is SO Konata"
stormagnet cracks up some more
stormagnet says, "I knew we couldn't be too far off from a more direct Sailor Moon reference"
stormagnet says, "Koenji?"
stormagnet says, "that's in Suginami!"
stormagnet says, "w00t!!"
stormagnet says, "I was right!"
stormagnet says, "That must have been Shinjuku, then!"

stormagnet says, "oh my my my"
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "that's nice"
stormagnet roots for Vivian
stormagnet says, "for that matter..."
stormagnet says, "you might have mentioned this in that long string of crossover associations..."
stormagnet says, "but is the Konata chick in Ultimate Girls Nagi from Hayate no gotoku?"
stormagnet says, "I mean,, the VA, not just the character similarity :P"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "hey!"
stormagnet says, "I think, between the kotatsu, this sticky-fever-patch, and the cold-medicine drink I got at the convenienceb store, my fever is starting to break!"
stormagnet says, "I feel a little more alert and awake now, and my headache is fading!"
stormagnet says, "AWESOME!"
stormagnet says, "I think I'll get some more of the same tomorrow, if the Lawson's carries it"
stormagnet says, "they take my BofA card ^_^"
stormagnet says, "we might want to go ahead with switching to Evergreen bank, though, at this rate"
stormagnet says, "thoug the CapOne card might be enough to get by with"
stormagnet says, "did you send that already?"
Crag wakes and reads scroll
Crag checks ultimate girls/hayate comparison
Crag says, "Katsura from Hayate is the same voice as Vivienne in Ultimate Girls."
Crag says, "ANN lists no other links."
Crag says, "BUT"
Crag says, "I don't see a Konata in the UG character list on ANN, so maybe they just don't have that information yet"
Crag says, "I gave the CapOne card to Ty, along with all the other stuff, but I don't know if/when he sent it."
Crag says, "I'll ask him when I see him today."
stormagnet says, "hihi"
Crag says, "Yay, you're awake! :)"
Crag pounces!
stormagnet squeals!
stormagnet says, "I would have never guessed the katsura link!"
stormagnet says, "I'm a little worried about giving everything to Ty to send..."
stormagnet says, "speaking of which..."
stormagnet says, "does thatinclude my bra?"
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet -_-;;;;;;;;;
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure how I feel about that......"
Crag says, "If he hasn't sent the stuff yet I could get it all from him and send it"
stormagnet says, "I mean, it is just a sports bra, but......."
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "no"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "that wouild just draw attention to it..."
stormagnet power blushes
Crag says, "sorry about that.  It didn't even occur to me."
stormagnet says, "it would be nice to know if/when he sent it, tho...."
stormagnet says, "baka"
Crag says, "I will ask"
stormagnet says, "you're a little too pure minded for your own good sometimes"
stormagnet says, "was it at least wrapped in something?"
Crag says, "In a plastic bag"
stormagnet says, "the documents weren't in the bag with it, right?"
Crag says, "No, he had those already"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "maybe he'll just put the bag in the box as-is...."
Crag says, "Katsura from Hayate _has_ been in a LOT of stuff."
Crag says, "ohwait, you were asking about konata"
Crag says, "And Nagi"
Crag says, "According to ANN, Nagi is the same voice as Alphonse Elric"
Crag says, "I'm still having a hard time with that one."
stormagnet says, "yeqah... damn"
stormagnet says, "not really awsking about Konata"
stormagnet says, "just noting a character resemblence :P"
Crag says, "I knew that, I was just mis-reading scroll :)"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "Still waking up"
stormagnet says, "I'm probably going to go to bed soon"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "but I think I might watch some Edo Rocket first... "
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "That will help you feel better!"
Crag says, "It is another great show."
stormagnet says, "now that my fever's broken a little, I can try to enjoy my convalescence"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "I've seen through episode 7 so far"
Crag says, "So maybe we can sync up on that one."
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "one down, 6 to go, then :)"
Crag :)
Crag says, "They'll go fast"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I'll watch them all before I go back to bed, then"
Crag says, "Yay, we can watch together tonight then maybe"
Crag says, "or tomorrow, or something"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "zomg!!"
Crag ?
stormagnet says, "otousan ga dechatta1"
stormagnet says, "it's the dad-cat-voice!!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I think you're right, I'll check"
stormagnet says, "he's scary, but I can't help but crack up when I hear it"
Crag says, "Yep, same voice"
Crag says, "Oh, and Maria from Hayate == Yomi from Azumanga Daioh, apparently"
stormagnet says, "after watching the first ep, I officially recommend "Code ED""
stormagnet says, "er, 'E'"
stormagnet says, "the d isa typo"
stormagnet says, "but I saw a bit on TV a while ago, got interested, downloaded the first two, got distracted, and just now watched it"
Crag says, "I have some downloaded"
Crag says, "Hadn't gotten around to watching it"
stormagnet says, "becuse one of my Oh! Edo eps wasn't finfishws"
stormagnet says, "YAY"
Crag says, "We can definitely watch that together"
stormagnet says, "it looks very promising!"
Crag says, "Yay!"
stormagnet says, "put 3+ in my folder?"
Crag says, "I'll give you 12"
Crag says, "that's how many I have"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "watch the first two now?"
stormagnet says, "er... or soon?"
Crag says, "Sure"
stormagnet says, "it's late, I know ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I have abotu 20 minutes left on the last episode of Claymore :)"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "it has a very Read or Die feel about some parts of it"
stormagnet says, "particularly the opening"
Crag says, "I think I remember coming to the same conclusion"
Crag says, "I bet if I check the logs I'll find something to that effect. :)"
Crag says, "In fact, I think the reason I hadn't watched it all yet was because I was waiting for you"
Crag says, "And then I forgot about it"
Crag says, "Oh yeah!"
Crag says, "I totally recommended that one"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm looking at its page on ANN now :)"
stormagnet cheers!!
stormagnet watches second Ep
stormagnet can't contain herself :P
Crag says, "Wait!"
Crag says, "I've already seen the first"
Crag says, "So just give me 20 minutes? :)"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeet!"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "I have to finish this last episode of Claymore :)"
stormagnet says, "I'll queue the rest in the meantime"
stormagnet says, "but hurry, ok?"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yes, I'll watch as fast as I can?"
stormagnet says, "eeep!"
stormagnet says, "we're missing episode 4!"
Crag says, "It's still copying!"
stormagnet says, "oh!"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "aheheheheheheheheh"
Crag says, "I think it's done now"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "If you tried to copy them before it finished you might have gotten a partial"
Crag says, "Check your file sizes"
stormagnet says, "so it is"
stormagnet says, "don;t worry, I hadn't started yet"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "ok, good"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "14 minuets of claymore left"
stormagnet resizes window for optimal simultaneous viewing!
Crag says, "Almost done over here..."
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "They're trying to set themselves up for a sequel"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  I was victimized by cliff hangers."
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "alright"
stormagnet says, "are we ready for launch?"
Crag says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet hits space!
Crag says, "It has the jazzy music just like Read or Die, too."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I want to stay in sync with you, so I'm not skipping the opening. :)"
stormagnet says, "oops!"
Crag ?
stormagnet skipped the opening ^_^;
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "because I had kind of started it when you told me to wait..."
stormagnet says, "so I was already through it, but right at the sponser screen...."
stormagnet says, "but you usually skip openings, so I though that was ok..."
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet pauses
Crag says, "I'm at the part where she's saying she has to stay away from that guy"
stormagnet says, "me too!"
Crag says, "Well, past that now :)"
stormagnet says, "she's leaving the house where I'm at"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "She's shopping"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
Crag says, "We're close :)"
stormagnet says, "you're past me!"
Crag says, "Noes!"
Crag says, "I'll slow down a little :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "mplayer lets me play at half speed""
Crag says, "ok, back to full speed."
Crag says, "She wants a phone :)"
stormagnet says, "oy!"
stormagnet says, "you're outright spoilering"
Crag says, "no!"
Crag says, "you're not pausing when you type are you?"
stormagnet was
Crag laughs and pauses
Crag says, "Naturally there will be some difficulties when we try to watch in sync the first time"
Crag says, "I've paused it"
stormagnet says, "I think I'm ok now"
Crag says, "I'm at 8m 3s"
stormagnet says, "7:44"
Crag says, "ok, tell me when you hit 8 :)"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
Crag says, "ok, we're in sync now :)"

Crag says, "oh noes!"
stormagnet says, "I understand his point, but I'd run too!"
Crag nodsnods!
stormagnet says, "hmmph"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Second episode wasn't as good as the first"
stormagnet says, "he's pretty dumb tnot realize how dangerous it is to come on so strong..."
stormagnet says, "sheesh"
Crag says, "yeah, he's a highschool dude"
Crag says, "of course he's dumb"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "ZOMG ELIECTRIC GIRL!  WANT!"
Crag says, "basically"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Should we watch 3 now?"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "How should we synchronize?"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
Crag says, "I'm watching the opening now"
stormagnet says, "let me make sure I've got it,iforst"
stormagnet says, "first"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "urgh"
stormagnet says, "not yet"
Crag says, "doh"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm only halfway through dowbloading it"
Crag says, "I don't mind waiting :)"
stormagnet says, "down, dammit"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "I like doing things together"
stormagnet says, "stupid typos"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "me too!"
stormagnet says, "I think I want to call it a night, though"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I'm getting really sleepy"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I've got lots of stuff I need to do"
Crag says, "like go to the office and complain about the neigbors"
Crag hugs!!!
Crag says, "Sleep well and get better!"
stormagnet idles: convalescing!
Crag says, "So the motorcycle is now parked at Shea's apartment."

Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "huzzah!"
Crag says, "i'm watching the opening."
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet starts up in a hurry!
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet is watching the opening
Crag says, "I paused at 0:30 (end of opening)"
Crag says, "Er, 1:30"
Crag says, "Let me know when you're there and I'll unpause"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet says, "I'm at 1:30 and paused!"
Crag says, "alright"
stormagnet says, "go!"
Crag says, "start-o!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "this is fun :)"
stormagnet says, "I like the little dancing dude"
Crag says, "go dancing dude!"
stormagnet says, "I get scareed by my alarm clock somethimes too"
Crag . o O ( no morning dressing service! )
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I guess it's not that sort of anime"
stormagnet says, "I note that she goes ful on oled-fashioned Showa style to match her electro-advoidance"
stormagnet says, "futon, not western-style bed, etc"
Crag says, "Naturally"
stormagnet says, "tatami room"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I also love the 'genko-youshi titles"
Crag says, "archer chicks in anime are hawt!"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "genko-youshi?"
stormagnet says, "all the school notebooks in Japan are that sort of boxed paper"
Crag says, "Ahh"
stormagnet says, "we have to use them for homework"
stormagnet says, "except I get special permission to type mine"
stormagnet says, "omg"
stormagnet says, "I would not have pegged her as an ojousama type"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "should have guessed from the 'sama'"
Crag says, "I guess they're trying to break some of the molds"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "oooh!"
stormagnet says, "she's covering for her!"
Crag grins
Crag says, "that's a good sign :)"
stormagnet says, "characters fir free and pure/true"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that guy is nuts"
stormagnet says, "I was a little worried"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "she's the 'suna-cool' type"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "love those short skirts"
stormagnet says, "oh yeah"
stormagnet says, "her uniform is also Showa style"
stormagnet says, "old fashioned, long skirt"
Crag says, "mmm, apple pie"
Crag says, "I had a danish this morning :)"
stormagnet says, "I love anpan!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "omg I want those now!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "after this I'm totally getting some from the Lawson's"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag lol
Crag says, "I guess he's a little clever"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "bwah!"
Crag says, "ruht roh"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "whoa?"
Crag says, "if you know what I mean"
Crag says, "'taste' of his 'vegetables'"
stormagnet says, "they even take off their school slippers in the gym changing room?"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag laughs at "level two rumor" too
stormagnet says, "awes"
stormagnet says, "her friends are funny"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "I like these people so far"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "aw, birdie"
stormagnet says, "ooooh!"
stormagnet says, "she haz pwers"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I knew it!"
stormagnet says, "awes!"
Crag :)
stormagnet says, "sasuga miko-sama!"
stormagnet says, "she's SO a shrine-maiden"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "We knew from the opening that there would be something like that"
Crag says, "And that four of them will team up and such."
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "oh course!"
stormagnet says, "birth of a new super-hero high-schooler set"
stormagnet says, "wonder what the jou-sama's power is?"
Crag says, "Which one is that?"
stormagnet says, "red head scary girl"
Crag says, "The short fiesty girl?"
Crag says, "Hm"
Crag says, "Some kind of attack?"
stormagnet says, "nice, jury rigging that himself!"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "Perhaps she has ESP!"
stormagnet says, "maybe!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "oooh!"
stormagnet says, "she's gonna get a talking to from the miko!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "I'm sure of it!"
stormagnet says, "oooh!"
stormagnet says, "enter the gaijin!"
Crag says, "Seeing airplanes makes me miss you"
stormagnet says, "eeeeeeeeeep"
stormagnet says, "aw!!!"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag sighs
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "good for another?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "let's let the creditsa run first"
Crag says, "I cried about the airplane stuff in Nodame Cantabile because of that"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "gives me a chance to get some meds"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet double hugs!!!!!
Crag hugs and sniffles on your shoulder.
Crag says, "I'll get some tea while you get meds"
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "ready when you are :)"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "I have to tell you about the tail first!"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
Crag says, "The day after halloween, on my way home from work"
Crag says, "I found somebody's tail from a big cat costume"
Crag says, "on the sidewalk"
stormagnet says, "zetsubou!"
Crag says, "And I took it home because of the girl in YES!!!"
Crag says, "I'm going to mount it!"
stormagnet says, "giggles!"
stormagnet mav
Crag says, "I love the tail pulling episode!"
stormagnet says, "YES!!!"
Crag says, "HEEEEEE"
stormagnet says, "excellent!!!"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I want to pull tails too!!"
Crag says, "ME TOO!"
Crag says, "WANT!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag . o O [ CRAG WANT PULL TAIL ]
Crag says, "ok, episode 4!"
Crag says, "Go!"
stormagnet says, "nice square!"
stormagnet says, "wait wait"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I'll wait for you at 1:30"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
Crag says, "rolling!"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "This is a pretty good thing we've got going"
stormagnet nods!!!
stormagnet says, "it's what I hoped it would be!"
Crag says, "It wouldn't work for zetsubo sensei because we'd have to pause so much to read everything"
stormagnet says, "naw, that would work"
stormagnet says, "just be slow!"
Crag says, "I suppose so"
Crag says, "I guess we'll see when episode 10 comes out!"
stormagnet says, "eep, I want to play back the egg thing"
Crag says, "Oh, ok"
Crag says, "I'll go back too :)"
stormagnet says, "ah!"
stormagnet says, "the one handed"
stormagnet says, "I can't do that well either"
stormagnet says, "2:59"
Crag says, "I'm with you"
Crag says, "We're within a few seconds of each other :)"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I don't think I've tried the one-handed egg thing"
stormagnet says, "I always drop shell in when I try"
Crag says, "It's a neat trick"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "inari-san!"
stormagnet says, "those are EVERYWHERE!"
Crag says, "goodness"
Crag says, "enormous boobs!"
stormagnet chuckles
stormagnet says, "they make a big deal out of everything"
stormagnet says, "like kids playing spys"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I remember kids doing that :)"
stormagnet says, "eh?"
stormagnet says, "was that a top sub?"
Crag says, "I think it was a warning or something"
Crag says, "It wasn't english :)"
stormagnet says, "ok :)"
stormagnet says, "damn straught!"
stormagnet says, "go science!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "he took the wrong direction with that"
Crag nods solemnly.
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "oog"
stormagnet says, "I can tell I still have a fever"
Crag says, "aww..."
stormagnet says, "because the stick on cool patches"
stormagnet says, "get hot to touch when the cooling runs out"
Crag says, "Oh my"
stormagnet says, "aheheheheheheheh"
Crag laughs at the gaijin.
stormagnet cackles!
stormagnet says, "Musashino, huh?"
stormagnet says, "for somebody who is trying to lie low"
Crag says, "damn, that text went by fast"
stormagnet says, "Tokyo seeems a bad place for it"
stormagnet says, "want to go back?"
Crag says, "nah"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "future is fun"
Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "I want more toys"
stormagnet nonods!
stormagnet says, "like her dad!"
Crag nods!
Crag says, "I hope he took care of ventilation"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet cracks up
Crag says, "He's..."
Crag says, "...uh..."
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "nice catch!"
stormagnet says, "found a dangerous way to 'stimulate' her"
Crag says, "UH OH"
Crag says, "he's going to get a lot of data shortly :)"
Crag says, "yay!  No such thing as good or bad power!"
stormagnet NODS!
Crag says, "This guy is insane, but he speaks for us a lot :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "he's good"
Crag says, "DOOM!!!"
stormagnet says, "??"
stormagnet says, "a-heh"
stormagnet says, "....."
Crag says, "hrm, I didn't expect that."
stormagnet did
stormagnet says, "challenge letter"
stormagnet knew it!
Crag says, "ah"
Crag says, "those three peeking are hilarious"
stormagnet giggles
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "They're not very stealthy!"
stormagnet says, "nice cover!"
Crag . o O ( cute! )
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "scary"
stormagnet says, "more scary!"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "Who watches the watchers?  The Shrine Maiden does!"
stormagnet says, "damn  skippy!"
stormagnet checks to see if 5 is done yet
Crag says, "Surely they're all done by now?"
stormagnet says, "they aborted pretty soon after I went to bed last night..."
Crag says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "5 is still only 55%..."
stormagnet ;_;
Crag says, "How long do they take?"
Crag says, "Does it give you an estimate?"
stormagnet says, "hard to say"
stormagnet says, "no estimate"
Crag says, "boo"
stormagnet says, "it seems to be speeding up a little, though"
stormagnet says, "are there any downloads you could throttle to speed things up?"
Crag says, "no downloads"
Crag says, "And uploads are throttled at 10k"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I didn't figure anything could really be going"
stormagnet says, "since I am getting a really good rate"
stormagnet says, "especially with distance considered"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "61%"
Crag says, "I sure would like to improve the quality of our connection, though"
stormagnet says, "it might be going fast enough for it to be worth waiting for, if you feel like staying up late"
stormagnet says, "yeah, me too"
Crag says, "maybe..."
stormagnet says, "I kind of wish I had a dedicated desktop running 24/7 for this"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "not that that would likely change me download abort problem"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet says, "64%"
Crag says, "If you had an always-online machine we could setup a tunnel"
stormagnet says, "I think I'm running about 1% per minute here"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that would rock so hard"
Crag says, "That might help some things out"
stormagnet says, "but I'd need an IP, right"
Crag says, "Not necessarily"
stormagnet says, "no?"
Crag says, "Basically you would get an IP from this end"
stormagnet says, "then why not tunnel my laptop?"
Crag says, "good question"
stormagnet says, "it's online often enough"
Crag says, "I'm thinking about how to set it up now..."
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "Science Mode, On!"
Crag laughs
Crag puts on his thinking tuke
Crag says, "There's some important aspect of this tunneling idea that I'm forgetting"
Crag says, "something is escaping me"
Crag says, "All the ssh tunneling I've done so far has just been port forwarding"
Crag says, "Which makes it so that any packets sent to a local port are copied to the remote host and sent from that host as though they had originated there, and vice versa"
Crag says, "but there's a way to make it assign a whole virtual interface and bridge traffic between that virtual interface and another virtual interface on the other end"
Crag says, "But to do it with windows..."
Crag says, "there's got to be a way"
Crag says, "ACTually..."
Crag says, "There may be a simpler way using ppp"
stormagnet says, "dammiy"
stormagnet says, "dammiT"
Crag says, "I will have to experiment with my laptop"
stormagnet says, "it just aborted again"
stormagnet says, "same error"
Crag says, "hrm"
Crag says, "What's the error?"
stormagnet says, "I think I just switched IPs"
Crag says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "copy error"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But that should break your ssh session too"
stormagnet says, "all my IM messages just refreshed, too"
stormagnet says, "it did"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "that would break the tunnel too"
stormagnet says, "which is why I'm running screen on wrack"
stormagnet says, "v.frustrating, that"
Crag says, "yeah, seriously"
stormagnet tries again
Crag says, "Are you on wireless?"
stormagnet says, "nope, ethernet"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "I think it's cable"
stormagnet says, "free through the building"
Crag says, "I wonder if they intentionally change IPs to interfere with stuff like what we want to do :)"
stormagnet says, "it's likely not worth waiting up for 5 now"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "maybe"
Crag says, "I don't want to stop hanging out with you"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "The antitode to IP changes would be to tunnel IP over some connectionless protocol"
Crag says, "OH"
Crag says, "THere's an IP over IP module for the linux kernel..."
stormagnet says, "could we do that?"
Crag says, "I wonder if I could set something up with colinux"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeet!"
Crag says, "damn, that would be an awesome hack"
Crag says, "It'll take a lot of research"
Crag says, "I don't think that module's in the default colinux build."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Checking my laptop now :)"
stormagnet says, "damn...."
stormagnet says, "that would be awesome for P2P masquerading in general"
Crag says, "It could be."
Crag says, "There's still other issues to work out, but yes, it's a step in that direction"
stormagnet says, "that's the sort of thing I was talking about before, I think"
stormagnet says, "when we gotdinged by Speakeasy"
Crag says, "I know"
Crag says, "It wouldn't help with that at all"
Crag says, "Because your traffic will appear to come from here"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "right"
Crag says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "it just sounds familiar"
Crag says, "There's a GNU project to work around that"
Crag says, "I think it's GNUnet or something"
stormagnet says, "awes"
Crag says, "A P2P suite for maximum privacy"
stormagnet says, "this sounds kinda familiar"
Crag says, "I couldn't find any porn when I tried it out"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "So I guess it's not very popular yet"
stormagnet says, "early stages"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "everyone's idealistic still"
Crag says, "Googling around a bit for ip over ip stuff"
Crag says, "yes, of course they are"
stormagnet says, "it'll be scientific papers and copies  of the constitution :P"
Crag says, "The GPL is their favorite example"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I don't know if the linux ipip module will tolerate changing IPs, but if it will...  you could even switch wireless networks without losing connectivity"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "I'm reading about it now, we'll see if I'm right..."
Crag says, "The really cool trick will be getting WINDOWS to talk through the tunnel"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "damn, looks like it's based on static IPs on both ends."
Crag sighs
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "weeeeak"
Crag says, "Well it's not over yet"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I still have lots of ideas :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm at 16%"
Crag says, "If people can tunnel IP over SMTP, I can sure as heck get you a stable connectino :)"
stormagnet says, "if it dies around 60~ again, it's going to be too repetetive for comfort- since it's doed around that mark twice now"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "It could be that there's some other problem"
stormagnet says, "20%"
stormagnet says, "it is coming down pretty fast"
Crag says, "brb, gotta make poops!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ok, I have another idea"
Crag says, "It may be a little TOO out there"
Crag says, "But"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "I think I remember that there's a way to hook up a network device to a userspace program"
Crag says, "Such as, for example, a perl script :)"
stormagnet says, "?!"
Crag says, "SO my idea is to have the perl script manage the re-connecting stuff"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "it'd be a huge project for me"
Crag says, "but good for learning and resume and all that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "If I can do that, then I can get our colinuxes tunneled to home"
Crag says, "Getting Windows to use that is a whole different problem"
Crag says, "The main problem being that Windows supports the hardware."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "So the real devices have to be alive and configured in windows"
Crag says, "And we have to create virtual connections to colinux which then go back to windows and back out to the real world"
Crag says, "gah"
Crag says, "my brain hurts"
Crag says, "I'll figure it out in my sleep or something :)"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I think I better sleep"
Crag says, "I want to be in good shape for game tomorrow"
Crag says, "I don't even know what busses to take yet."
Crag says, "I guess I could look that up now"
stormagnet says, "it sounds similar to that trick you useed to let colinux run independant of the networks"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I was thinking along those lines"
Crag says, "I never did set that up properly on your laptop, either."
Crag says, "sorry about that."
Crag says, "oh, I don't know the address of nerdhalla"
Crag says, "This will be interesting"
Crag says, "maybe google will save me"
Crag says, "I LOVE YOU GOOGLE!!!!"
stormagnet says, "try the red apple insyead"
stormagnet laughs!Q
Crag says, "I put in "beacon hill, seattle, washington" and google knew what I meant"
Crag says, "And then I clicked "directions to here""
Crag says, "Then I typed "2" and it offered autocompletion for home"
Crag says, "And then it showed me driving directions and I clicked "take public transit""
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "so awesome!"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "It doesn't seem to have a way of specifying a different time for the trip though"
Crag says, "Interesting."
Crag says, "Oh well!"
Crag says, "I'll just refresh in the morning :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Even at this hour it looks like a pretty mellow trip"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "sinday schedule is different"
Crag says, "yeah, but still"
stormagnet says, "better check metro tripplanner for those routes"
Crag says, "yeah, I'll do that now"
Crag says, "I'm golden"
Crag says, "I walk up to eastlake, board the 594 at 10am, get off 15 minutes later, wait 7 minutes, get on 38, ride 5 minutes more."
Crag says, "And that's to get me there 30 minutes early"
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
stormagnet says, "64%"
Crag says, "hang in there!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I just watched- it's actually more like 1% every 30 seconds"

stormagnet says, "hee hee!"
Crag says, "The 36 starts at 6th and Lenora, which is by the WOC, and goes straight to nerdhalla"
Crag says, "I'm going to walk a little and skip the transfer"
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "I kind of thought that might be better, too"
stormagnet says, "you can get a bus pass from work now!"
Crag says, "So I need to leave the apartment by 9:40 to be safe"
Crag says, "I could"
Crag says, "I don't get to switch to a bus pass until January though"
Crag says, "They only let us switch four times a year"
Crag says, "Oh, I should order that hard drive soon so I can obsolete the co-lo"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll do that after game tomorrow"
Crag says, "And maybe I'll order more groceries too"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "89%!"
stormagnet says, "you could get started  now :)"
Crag says, "it's so close we can taste it!"
Crag says, "I'm closing out some firefox tabs"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "at this point, if it were to abort, I'd just watch what I have so far"
stormagnet says, "I'd pry only miss the end theme"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "It'll keep going!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "92%!"
Crag says, "I might just buy the large LCD at $400"
Crag says, "and not try to get a Super Deal"

stormagnet says, "bwah"
stormagnet says, "I was that girl"
stormagnet says, "new profs would always call on me to answer because I was blatantly not paying attention"
stormagnet says, "because it was always stuff I'd already done"
Crag nods :)
stormagnet says, "I'd usually be reading a book in class"
stormagnet says, "hard to convince them that I could listen and read at the same time"
Crag says, "I didn't notice anyone like that in school.  I wonder if anyone at my schools was at that level."
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Maybe Molly."
stormagnet says, "they were pry just more subtle"
Crag says, "I was also even more oblivious back then :)"

Crag says, "Yeah, I knew what you meant :)"
stormagnet says, "I tended to be the one to scold friends like that ^_^;"
Crag says, "I was getting a little tired of Ebihara's whining."
stormagnet says, "the sort of thing you can never really hear properly unless it comes from a friend"
Crag says, "I can imagine that :)"

Crag says, "We just watched 5"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet lost track
Crag laughs!

Crag says, "GAH"
Crag says, "called by work"
Crag says, "due to daylight saving time change"
Crag says, "now I have to watch the system until the top of the hour to make sure it comes back to its senses."
[Idling at 1:48 A.M. on Sun, Nov 4: sleep and YAY GAME!]

stormagnet fell asleep while studying ^_^;
stormagnet says, "I guess my fever isn't copmpletely better yet... ^_^;"

stormagnet says, "I'll explain to the profs, I think they'll understand"
stormagnet says, "and let me take a make-up for the kanji test ^_^;"

stormagnet | Bono's ONE Campaign has selected the University of Washington to host a
stormagnet | campus-wide dialogue aimed at inspiring students like you to become more
stormagnet | politically active citizens.
stormagnet |
stormagnet | Event Details:
stormagnet | ONE Student | ONE Vote
stormagnet | 5 p.m., Thursday, Nov. 8th
stormagnet | HUB Ballroom
stormagnet | Free pizza
stormagnet says, "the fact that they felt the need to add free pizza to sweeten the deall makes me a little sick, though"
stormagnet says, "not that I'd turn it down!"
stormagnet says, "ok, translation note for Edo Rocket-"
stormagnet says, "In the Edo period, 'saraba' would be a more likely choice than 'sayounara'"
stormagnet says, "but I'll forgive them that, since 'sayounara' is more recognizable, and thus has the emotional impact that 'saraba' would lack"
stormagnet says, "I love the open and end themes to this series"
stormagnet says, "and they're counting episodes with the counter for 'shots'"
stormagnet says, "which cracks me up"
stormagnet says, "that's equivelent to calling them 'launches'"
stormagnet :P
stormagnet says, "I was wondering how long it was going to take for a more direct Kaguya reference"
stormagnet says, "ah, the titlers are counting them as 'blasts'"
stormagnet says, "that works too, I suppose :)"
stormagnet says, "HENSHIN?!"
stormagnet curls up and quivers
stormagnet says, "this is even better than the helicopter sequence"
stormagnet says, "THANK GOD IT INTERUPTED"
stormagnet says, "eeeeeewwww"
stormagnet says, "CELLS!?"
stormagnet cracks up
stormagnet . o O ( blatant exposition stick humor!! )

stormagnet nods
Crag says, "There are lots of anachronisms in Edo Rocket :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet <3
Crag says, "hahaha!"
Crag says, "I knew you'd love all that stuff :)"
Crag says, "It's a good time for anime."
stormagnet nodnods
stormagnet says, "yes?!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "So I've got about an hour to get ready to go :)"
stormagnet says, "more ACode E?!"

Crag says, "Gaijin don't really need stamps do they?"
stormagnet says, "nope"
stormagnet says, "you can sign"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "this show is funny :)"
stormagnet says, "I've thought about getting one, though"
stormagnet says, "just 'cuz they're kind of cool :)"
Crag says, "yeah, they are"
stormagnet says, "they seem horribly insecure to me, though"
stormagnet says, "well, a signature can be faked"
stormagnet says, "and if a stamp is stolen, you'd notice right away"
Crag says, "But if someone duped it"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "They wouldn't have to have any signing skill to use it"
Crag says, "The duper and user could be different people"
stormagnet says, "the idea with stamps is that they're so intricate that a fake is easier to detect"
stormagnet says, "who"
Crag says, "I think that's less true these days than a few decades ago"
Crag says, "The car?  We didn't see."
stormagnet says, "did they just make a go for it?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it seemed like they wer about to make a grab"
stormagnet says, "in a really stupid obvious spot"

stormagnet says, "ever"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "what? you can buy stamps?"
stormagnet says, "yeah, if you're a foreigner, you have to get a custom one"
Crag says, "I mean pre made?"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Even more insecure"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "they all have tiny differences"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet says, "and the carving differs in thickness and eveness and such"
Crag says, "so it's like it's watermarked"
stormagnet says, "so that the ink imp yes, bingo"
stormagnet says, "if you check a stamp impression under a microscope, forgeries are pretty easy to detect"
stormagnet says, "supposedly"
Crag grins.

Crag says, "You're welcome :)"
stormagnet says, "I feel much more light-hearted, too"
stormagnet says, "it's really nice, not having to worry about it"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "It's going to be hard to get ready for game if this cat is going to sit here all morning."
stormagnet says, "and I always felt a little bad, since it was your paycheck in the first place"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet says, "now, when I buy something, it feels more like a present from you ^_^"
Crag says, "Good.  I like that."
stormagnet says, "you should take Marco with you"
stormagnet says, "he can be an NPC"
Crag laughs
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "he would not be OK with that :)"
Crag says, "a 10 minute walk and 20 minute bus ride."
stormagnet says, "no, of course not"
Crag says, "That would be ugly"
stormagnet says, "he seems like he might handle a leash pretty well, though"

stormagnet says, "I learned this one from Fukuzawa's memoirs, and as he was dictating them to a woman, he claimed he forgot the third"

stormagnet says, "I think I'm going to go home at the break"
stormagnet says, "but normally class seems to go really slow, and now it feels like it's going fast"
stormagnet says, "I'm pry fuzzing out ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "but at least, since I showed up for the first half, I'll only get marked absent for the latter"
Crag deposits 3 and 4 in for-stormy
Crag says, "I haven't watched them yet though"
Crag says, "So that would be another good one to watch together."
Crag says, "So game was pretty great, except that Ben was under prepared and was complaining about the system in silly ways"
Crag says, "I'm REALLY glad Greg is GMing.  He's much better at keeping Ben in check."
Crag says, "We got to do a short mock battle and it was a blast."
Crag says, "I like what I've seen of this system so far."
Crag says, "Apparently things get complicated with magic and stuff, but for a crag style charachter it's dead simple."
Crag says, "Ben and I totally worked a couple of NPCs. :)"
Crag says, "Shea and James have charachters which are super weak at first but will turn into monsters later"
Crag says, "My charachter is useful now and will just be a solid support structure for the team through our campaign"
Crag says, "All three of the other players made their charachters rather complicated"
Crag says, "James' charachter is hilarous.  He has a curse where when his eyes are unobstructed he is paralyzed by visions of human suffering."
Crag says, "So he wears a blindfold most of the time."
Crag says, "But this turned out to be pretty great because when the NPC with the dual-pistol skills showed up on our ship, she totally ignored him thinking he was no threat."
Crag says, "And he was able to keep her from doing anything useful for several rounds while Ben and I worked the other NPC who boarded."
Crag says, "Once James gets some XP (and it won't take long) he's going to have the ability to do some kind of telepathy mind-fucking thing."
Crag says, "Shea made a basic sorcerer with an apothacary flavor"
Crag says, "He's almost completely useless at this point, except that he succeeded in causing the other ship to run aground by messing with the weather."
Crag says, "So that was pretty cool"
Crag says, "I think we've got a highly complimentery crew together."
Crag says, "Also, I'm feeling a lot more confident about taking on more of a leadership role in this campaign."
Crag says, "The other three of created charachters who are in no position to lead whatsoever and mine is very well suited to it."
Crag says, "So it's going to be a kind of obvious thing that way."
Crag says, "I'm really excited :)"
Crag says, "The back stories are pretty great, too."
Crag says, "I'll tell you about them when I get back from half-priced Sunday dinner."
stormagnet is home now!
stormagnet got some medicine from the campus clinic
stormagnet says, "more is not working..."
stormagnet says, "I think I may have the wrong command, or something"
stormagnet says, "what is the "press TAB for more" command again?"
stormagnet . o O ( TAB! )
Crag back
Crag says, "/more"
Crag says, "paging is a feature of tinyfugue, and all tf commands start with slash"
Crag says, "So to turn on paging is /more on"
stormagnet says, "that's what I thought!"
stormagnet says, "it's not working :("
Crag says, "Hm..."
Crag says, "Lemme check my tfrc and see if I can remember any gotchas"
Crag says, "Here's what I have, but I don't remember what a lot of it means"

stormagnet applauds
Crag says, "Anyway, I don't know if any of that helps"
stormagnet will find out!
Crag says, "THere's a /help command too"
Crag says, "But the help is like man pages"
stormagnet says, "finding out how to set isize already helps considerably"
Crag says, "You have to know the answer already to find it :P"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "since sometimes I size my window down to only a couple lines when watching full screen"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Ahh"
Crag says, "Since I use focus-follows-mouse, I just have the video window on top of the terminal window"
Crag says, "Then I don't have to resize the terminal at all"
Crag checks /help more too...
Crag says, "Oh weird, escape h, escape l and escape j are news to me"
Crag says, "I will have to remember those"
Crag says, "Let me know if none of that helps and I'll dig deeper."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "now that we're both home..."
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Oh yeah, let's watch more together!"
Crag says, "But first"
Crag says, "I have to tell you a theory I have"

Crag says, "One of the waitresses at SLG reminds me of one of the women in Laura's dancing crowd"
Crag says, "Miss Georgia Myles"
Crag says, "The woman who MCs when the gross long-haired guy is absent"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "My theory is that they are the same person :)"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "have you gone recently?"
Crag says, "Not to the show"
stormagnet says, "you should do a closer comparison :)"
Crag says, "MAYbe..."
stormagnet says, "the possibility is certainly worth considering"
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "So watch more Code - E then?"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Ready when you are"
stormagnet resizes!
Crag says, "I'm rolling"
Crag says, "Will emit MARK at 1:30 again"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "oh crap gotta go to the bathroom!"

stormagnet says, "ok!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag | MARK
stormagnet says, "MARK"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I had it paused with the arrow about to hit"
Crag says, "And then only had to wait about a second for you :)"
Crag says, "wait, which episode are we on?"
Crag says, "I think I started the wrong one"
Crag says, "We saw 6 already didn't we"
stormagnet says, "7"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "doh"
Crag says, "ok, starting 7..."

stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "at 1:30 and waiting"
Crag | MARK

stormagnet says, "aheheheheh"
Crag says, "shall we try again?"
stormagnet says, "hey, my TAB thing is working!"
stormagnet says, "sure"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "mark at 3?"
Crag says, "sounds good"
stormagnet says, "no wait"
That is not a valid command.
stormagnet says, "uh, pause at 3, mark at 3:30?"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "ok, paused"
Crag says, "Hold on, I need to go back and see what's going on :)"

stormagnet waits
Crag says, "ok, paused at 3"

stormagnet says, "....."
Crag says, "hm, maybe"
stormagnet says, "KIMOI"

stormagnet says, "oh, ok :)"
Crag says, "I'll just be a couple minutes"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "Let's just emit two marks rather than pausing"
Crag says, "one at 1:30 and one at 1:40"
stormagnet nods
Crag | MARK1
stormagnet says, "wait!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet wasn't ready1
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "I'm waiting :)"
Crag says, "The cool thing is since I hit MARK1 first, I paused there"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And now when I see your MARK1 I unpause, and etc"
stormagnet was going to do the same ^_^;;
Crag says, "but this way it's less ambiguous :)"
stormagnet says, "MARK1"
stormagnet says, "MARK2"
Crag | MARK2
Crag says, "wait"
Crag says, "oh that's fine"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "that was dead on :)"
Crag says, "I emited it a few seconds early though"
Crag says, "I mis-reacted, but it was close enough anyway"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "OH CRAP"
Crag says, "I started the wrong episode again!"
stormagnet says, "noes!"
Crag says, "how far in are you :)"
stormagnet says, "2:36"

stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "I was a little late to react"
Crag laughs
stormagnet paused reflexively at 3
stormagnet says, "to boot"
Crag says, "should we resync?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I'll take your cue"
Crag says, "I wonder if we should just go back to 1:30 :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "So that we can have a smooth opening"
stormagnet says, "I'm still right on 3"
Crag says, "OH ok"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
Crag says, "I'll back up to 3"
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "and let you know when I hit 3"
stormagnet says, "I'll start on your 'start'"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "agreed"
stormagnet says, "no confirmation- that's been slowing me down"
Crag says, "start"
stormagnet says, "I don't have focus-following set up"

stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "hoo"
stormagnet says, "it didn't flicker"
Crag says, "oh, it's a different problem this time"
Crag says, "You're right"
stormagnet says, "ergo the title, I guess"

stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "this show isn't very old"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I want to get mine hooked up better too"
Crag says, "naturally"
stormagnet says, "I still need to get earphones for it"
stormagnet says, "since they have a dumb proprietary interface"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "of course"
stormagnet . o O ( like everrything elseloses )
Crag says, "apparently there are only 12 episodes!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I guess it's not as much like Read Or Die as I thought"
stormagnet says, "in a pot, it takes longer, and is more likely to burn, tho"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "influences by, maybe"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "here we go"
Crag says, "heh, yeah"

Crag says, "Either way"
stormagnet says, "eeeep"
Crag says, "It's not over"
Crag says, "But what can they do in just two more episodes?"
stormagnet says, "it's a 'green' town, by the looks of it"
Crag says, "I wonder if there's another season in the works"
stormagnet says, "just waiting for it's battery...."

Crag says, "it's..."
Crag says, "um"
stormagnet says, "neither does exit, or ctrl-c"
Crag says, "^[ to get to a telnet prompt"
stormagnet says, "or esc"
Crag says, "And then quit, I think"
stormagnet says, "dammit!"
Crag says, "?"
Crag says, "Or maybe it's ^]"
Crag says, "yeah, ^]"
Crag says, "I wonder if you pressed ^s and aren't seeing any of what you're doing."
Crag says, "or any of what I'm responding with"
Crag says, "In which case..."
Crag says, "there's not much I can do to help"
Crag says, "I'll work on my groceries"
stormagnet has reconnected.
Crag says, "better?"
stormagnet says, "I think so"
stormagnet says, "yes"

Crag says, "GAMES!"
stormagnet says, "we had secret signals and meeting places and evewrything"
stormagnet says, "and note drops"
stormagnet says, "where we could avoid detection :P"
Crag says, "And now we could use GPS and stuff"
stormagnet says, "awesome!"
stormagnet says, "maybe we could even do teams!"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "have one be the watchers"
stormagnet says, "but that wouldn't be as good"
stormagnet says, "since a real team would never live up to my paranoiac invented ones :)"
stormagnet says, "hmmmmmm"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "iiiiinteresting :)"
stormagnet says, "eeeeeeee!"

stormagnet says, "how can they think they're being sneaky with those wrist bands on?"
Crag giggles
stormagnet says, "the forest animals are the horror part!"
Crag says, "I've never seen fireflies."
stormagnet says, "me neither"
stormagnet says, "I hear they're dying off in Japan"
Crag says, ""aw"
stormagnet says, "due to river pollution"
stormagnet nods
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "is teh sad"
stormagnet says, "I hope I get a chance to see them first, at least"
stormagnet says, "but I hope more that science resurrects them"
Crag says, "HM"
stormagnet says, "yeeeeeees"
Crag says, "this last episode is NOT going to resolve anything."
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "oh, I'm sure it will"
stormagnet says, "with EXPLOSIONS"
Crag shakes a tiny fist in anticipation
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "want a break first?"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "just a little one"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I have a prof I need to email"
stormagnet says, "and I almost feel like having a 'crap, last episode of a really good series!' smoke :P"
Crag laughs some more

Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "I have a balcony that I haven't gotten a chance to use at *all*, too"

Crag laughs!
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I'm ready at 1:30"
stormagnet says, "me too"
Crag says, "I'll give the start"
Crag says, "start!"
stormagnet nods
Crag | 1:40
Crag | 1:45
stormagnet says, "jeh"
Crag says, "etc"
Crag says, "how'd you do?"
stormagnet says, "wasn't ready to mark 1:40"
Crag laughs
stormagnet paused at 1:41 ^_^;
stormagnet says, "it was on"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet says, "but I was startled"
stormagnet says, "too soon"
Crag says, "Let's go back to 1:30!"
stormagnet says, "ten seconds is too fast for my typing ^_^;;"
stormagnet goes back
That is not a valid command.
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "I'll do 1:45 then"
stormagnet says, "that's good :0"
stormagnet prepares her mark
Crag grins
Crag says, "So I'm going to give the 'start' which means unpause from 1:30, then I will emit 1:45 to indicate I'm there"
Crag says, "YOu emit 1:45 when you pass 1:45"
Crag says, "I will pause if needed"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "to sync us up that way"
Crag says, "So all you have to do is hit space when I give the 'start', then switch to this window and hit enter at 1:45"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "ok, here goes..."
Crag says, "start"
Crag says, "1:45"
stormagnet says, "MARK 1:45"

stormagnet says, "they'd be fried"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "that dragon could never fly"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag . o O ( my boob sense is tingling! )
stormagnet says, "OH SHIT"
stormagnet says, "they were using her to catalyse something"
Crag says, "ohhhhh"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "pry a bigass vat of virii"
Crag says, "yeah, like lake-size or aquifer"
Crag says, "Not just in a tank"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "So the animals and plants all contained water with the virii in them"
Crag says, "maybe"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet thought so
Crag says, "Yuma will come fix him up"

stormagnet grins
Crag says, "F for... uh... friends? :)"
stormagnet says, "ah"
stormagnet says, "Code Ex!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "the subbers tipped it in the credits"
Crag says, "I wasn't paying attention"
stormagnet googles
stormagnet says, "ah"
stormagnet says, "the story continues in the *manga* Code-Ex"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "well"
stormagnet says, "but it hasn't been picked up for animation yet"
stormagnet can translate it ^_^
Crag says, "here's hoping"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That show had a lot of unrealized potential"
Crag says, "I liked it a lot, but I'm frustrated that it didn't go farther."
stormagnet says, "Code Ex is being serialized in Sunday GX"
stormagnet says, "I'll pick it up later"
Crag says, "Cool"
Crag says, "I could tell you more about The Adventures of Edward "The Bull" Jenkins now if you like"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "OK"
Crag says, "First my backstory"
Crag says, "Edward Jenkins was born in 1687 on a farm in England"
Crag says, "At 17 his family died in unusual circumstances"
Crag says, "his father had refused several buyout offers"
Crag says, "And while Edward had been away visiting a friend his family died in a fire"
stormagnet says, "meeeeeeesteriously"
Crag says, "exactly :)"
stormagnet says, "is he motivated by...."
stormagnet says, "a LUST for the TRUTH?"
Crag says, "revenge and not wanting to be poor"
Crag says, "and truth too yeah"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "much better"
Crag says, "So he joined the British navy"
stormagnet says, "muah"
Crag says, "He was big and strong before he joined"
stormagnet says, "and sailed the seven seas"
stormagnet says, "one day he overheard"
Crag says, "His family were all genetically predisposed to ass-kicking"
Crag laughs
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "No, not that story"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "I leave it up to Greg to pull that thread if he wants"
Crag says, "But I did leave it there for him on purpose :)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "most awesome"
Crag says, "Edwards dad was a big guy who wandered from town to town maknig trouble"
Crag says, "When he came to Edward's mom's town he found that Edward's mom was ALSO large and troublesome"
Crag says, "And that she could take everything he dished out and throw it back double"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "and then there was Harvest moon: Knockout!""
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "thank you thnk you"
Crag says, "So Edward's father took the name of his new bride because he was wanted in other towns"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Jenkins is his mother's name :)"
stormagnet says, "good enough reason :)"
stormagnet says, "ergo"
stormagnet says, "Ed Jenkins"
Crag says, "And the Jenkins family made a bunch of large, fiesty sons"
stormagnet says, "that's like how my mom got sddled with Donna"
stormagnet says, "yay feist!"
Crag says, "Farmwork is tough, and wrestling with brothers is tougher, so Ed's a tough guy going into the navy"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But in the navy he learned to shut his yap"
Crag says, "The British navy didn't have a lot of mutinees"
stormagnet says, "in Princess Maker, faming is the job you pick if you're raising her to be wa warrior ^_^"
Crag says, "awesome!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That was my plan all along of course :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Edward was involved in three mutinees"
Crag says, "He put down the first one"
stormagnet says, "HAW"
Crag says, "Almost singlehandedly"
Crag says, "By the second one he had already earned the title "The Bull""
Crag says, "I made him a Taurus :)"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "The second set of mutineers incapacitated Edward before revealing their plan"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "that lasted, I;m sure"
Crag says, "Edward and the officers got dropped on an island"
Crag says, "And were picked up by the Spanish a few weeks later"
Crag says, "And put in prison in Spain"
Crag says, "So Edward arranged a jail break"
Crag says, "And rescued the officers and a few loyal crew who had also been part of all that"
Crag says, "They got back to England where Edward got a medal for his work."
Crag says, "Most of the officers swore off sailing after that harrowing experience"
stormagnet says, "nice"
Crag says, "But one of them refused to accept the circumstances"
Crag says, "He took a new commission and requested Edward for his crew"
Crag says, "They set sail under orders to protect merchant vessels"
Crag says, "But this captain had an axe to grind"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "ANd he went 'a little Ahab'"
Crag says, "At first Edward tried to reason with the captain"
stormagnet says, "in the belly of a whale"
Crag says, "he tried various things to get the captain back on an even keel"
Crag says, "But it was no use"
Crag says, "So Edward led the third mutinee he was involved in"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Where in he captured the captain and three loyal crew"
Crag says, "Brought the ship back to england"
Crag says, "DRopped them off somewhere nearby and safe, and then sailed the ship to the Caribean"
Crag says, "Because Edward is loyal, but he knows which way the wind blows"
stormagnet says, "nice"
Crag says, "Edward left the ship as soon as they got to the west indies"
Crag says, "He didn't really want anything to do with all that"
Crag says, "He had planned to stick with the navy and his plans had fallen through"
Crag says, "So he hung out for a while drinking and thinking"
Crag says, "until he got shang-hai'd for Greg's game :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "And he will awake in captivity with three strange people"
stormagnet says, "excellent"
Crag bows!
stormagnet says, "of COURSE"
Crag says, "Thankyou, thank you!"
stormagnet says, "and pry pretty savvy about it"
Crag says, "I like to think so."
Crag says, "Would you like to hear about the other three now?"
stormagnet says, "yes'm!"
Crag says, "Shea didn't provide much backstory yet"
Crag says, "His charachter is a hatian sorcerer"
stormagnet says, "nice start!"
Crag says, "he's also the most silver-tongued of us based on stats."
Crag says, "And he used it to humorous effect in the mock battle too :)"
stormagnet says, "he'd have to be :)"
Crag says, "I'll tell you more about him when I find out!"
stormagnet says, "of course"
stormagnet says, "go Shea :)"
Crag says, "yeah, I'm excited!"
Crag says, "ok, Ben"
Crag says, "Oh, Shea's charachter is Akkan or somethign like that"
Crag says, "Ben's charachter is named Jim"
Crag says, "Again, no last name"
stormagnet says, "of course"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Jim was raised by 'aunts' who said his parents are dead, or missing, or whatever"
stormagnet says, "that sounds like Ben, alright"
Crag says, "But wouldn't tell him how or anything"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "nice"
Crag says, "He ran off at around 17 and joined a ship for the adventure"
stormagnet says, "leaves lots of room for the GM to fill in at leisure"
Crag says, "But it turned out that most of the ship had joined to steal the ship"
Crag says, "yes :)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "poor kid"
stormagnet says, "nice touch"
Crag says, "They stole the ship and headed for some treasure they'd heard about"
Crag says, "And they found it"
Crag says, "unfortunately"
Crag says, "The whole crew gathered around the chest"
stormagnet says, "very Treasure Island"
Crag says, "And when they opened the chest there was an explosion of some sort"
stormagnet says, "I hate when that happens"
Crag says, "And when Jim came to, all the rest of the crew were dead and he was badly injured"
Crag says, "FOR YOU SEE, the treasure was cursed!  Also the slurpee is cursed."
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "The curse is one of righteousness"
stormagnet says, "VERY Treasure Island"
Crag says, "Where immoral acts do physical harm to those who are cursed"
stormagnet says, "whoa"
Crag says, "However, Jim aquired some magical items from the treasure"
stormagnet says, "very Ben"
Crag says, "I know of at least a hat and a sword"
Crag says, "yes :)"
Crag says, "The hat is decorative as far as I can tell"
stormagnet says, "I'm betting he's min-maxing this for all it's worth"
Crag says, "he's trying!"
Crag says, "Always!"
Crag says, "That's what Bens doooo."
stormagnet says, "he's going to be a pain about it, per usual, but interesting"
stormagnet loses1
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Yeah, I think Greg can manage Ben pretty well :)"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'm really glad to be in a game under Greg."
stormagnet says, "they go way back"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "SO I guess the main thing with Ben is that he cannot lose the sword"
stormagnet says, "I swear, a lot of that is out of their reciprocal influence"
Crag heh
Crag says, "probably"
Crag says, "That's all I know about Jim so far"
Crag says, "I saved James' charachter for last because he's my favorite so far"
Crag says, "His name is uh..."
Crag says, "I might have to check my laptop"
stormagnet says, "blindold dude!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Lemme check the notes :)"
stormagnet says, "hey, blindfold dude, your turn on watch!"
stormagnet says, "blindfold dude, trim those sails!"
Crag LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "hey, blindfold dude, cold enough for yah?"
Crag says, "Albanus Wade"
stormagnet says, "stop calling me that!"
stormagnet says, "my name is not blindfold dude!"
Crag says, "It's Albanus!"
Crag says, "Or Mr. Wade to you!"
stormagnet says, "it's Obstructed Vantage of Earthly Hell!"
stormagnet loses
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "That's good too"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "Albanus hails from Denmark"
Crag says, "He didn't have much education"
Crag says, "I can't remember how he got separated from his family"
Crag says, "But he ended up on a ship"
Crag says, "And the ship was attacked"
Crag says, "Oh no"
stormagnet says, "by a whale!"
Crag says, "The ship did the attacking, that's right"
stormagnet says, "dang"
Crag says, "He had joined a pirate ship"
Crag says, "But didn't realize that there would be blood and stuff"
stormagnet says, "strong minded ship loses"
Crag says, "He was in it for the rum"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Anyway, when the pirates he was with attacked another ship he was terrified and disgusted"
Crag says, "He hid behind a barrel"
stormagnet says, "classy!"
Crag says, "And they left him behind"
stormagnet says, "whatever works :)"
Crag says, "So he was adrift on an abandoned pirate ship for a while"
Crag says, "plagued by visions of human suffering"
stormagnet says, "and then the barrel exploded.."
stormagnet loses
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Nothing special about the barrel :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet kicks a pebble
Crag says, "He just went crazy is all"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "his is awesome, you're right"
Crag says, "Hames says Albanus says god is punsihing him for being part of the pirates' plot"
Crag says, "So Albanus is just plain tormented all the time"
stormagnet says, "nice"
Crag says, "He covers his eyes to keep the visions out"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "but James has some angle he's working on"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "James is good like that"
Crag says, "Where Albanus has telepathy and the ability to mess with peoples' heads"
stormagnet says, "DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?!"
Crag says, "It looks like he might even have the ability to target specific portions of the nervous system"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "Aiiiieeeee"
stormagnet wets pants and jibbers
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "empathy damage!"
Crag says, "So here's how great James' charachter is"
Crag says, "We're doing ship battle, cannons versus canons"
Crag says, "And the other ship's mage teleports their captain over to our ship, belowdecks, behind Jim where Jim is firing canons at them"
Crag says, "Nobody sees this"
Crag says, "But when this captain attacks and strikes Jim, Albanus feels the suffering"
stormagnet says, "eeeep"
Crag says, "And announces to those abovedecks that there are boarders on the ship"
stormagnet says, "ow"
stormagnet says, "rough ability, that"
Crag says, "So I run down and help Ben out, and Shea heads for the lifeboat to save himself :)"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag it was awesome!
Crag says, "So then!"
Crag says, "A couple turns later the enemy mage teleports the gunslinger over"
Crag says, "And she ignores Jim"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "Albunus I mean"
Crag says, "Ignores James :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet got it
Crag says, "And James can hear her, so he runs around her planning to shover her overboard!"
Crag says, "They grabble for two turns!"
stormagnet says, "just call him Blindfold Dude, like everybody else"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "She breaks free, but by that time Ben and I are coming up from belowdecks"
Crag says, "So instead of fighting Blindfold Dude she tries to shoot both of us at once"
stormagnet hears, from offstage, "It's Obstructed Vantage of Earthly Hell, dammit!
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag . o O ( this would make a great anime )
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Jim and I rush her.  Jim takes a bullet in his left hand, she misses me"
Crag says, "Jim stabs her, I punch her in the head."
Crag says, "MEANWHILE"
Crag says, "OVoEH grabs her from behind and DISCHARGES ONE OF HER SPARE PISTOLS!"
stormagnet LAUGHS!
Crag says, "Doing damage, I might add!"
Crag says, "She panics and tries to jump overboard in the next round!"
stormagnet says, "but he doesn't SE that, so it's ok!"
Crag says, "Jim and I both hit her in the head, knocking her out before she goes over the rail!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag nodsnods!
Crag says, "At this point Greg declared us winners even though we hadn't taken on the mage in the other ship yet"
stormagnet says, "I like the, 'eeep! run away!' 'oh no you don't!' turn-around"
Crag says, "YES!"
Crag says, "It was a blast :)"
Crag says, "Oh man"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I didn't even tell you about the captain!"
stormagnet says, "very nice!"
Crag says, "The captain of the other ship is aweasome"
Crag says, "he's this canibal dude"
stormagnet says, "um"
Crag says, "He's got gnarly teeth and stuff"
Crag says, "I kicked his head off though :)"
stormagnet says, "that could be a problem"
stormagnet says, "oh!"
stormagnet says, "alrighty then"
Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "It was great!"
Crag says, "He took a couple bites out of Jim and me, but nothing we couldn't handle"
stormagnet says, "I take it he captains alright, once you have his head under control"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag laughs
Crag says, "Poor Jim was in a spot until I got belowdecks"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "The enemy had gotten the jump on hinm"
Crag says, "But when I came down the captain turned to me, probably figuring I was more of a threat (and he was right)"
stormagnet says, "Jim sounds like the kind of character that would end up in a harem anime"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "For some reason this guy went for my ribbs"
stormagnet says, "and you're the big stoic NPC dude who keeps saving his ass"
Crag says, "I guess he was looking for particular meats"
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag says, "Heh, yeah, that's true"
Crag says, "Anyway, I kicked the captain in the head right out"
stormagnet layghs!
Crag says, "And Jim stabbed hinm"
Crag says, "That knocked him to the floor"
stormagnet says, "for seasoning!"
Crag says, "Then the captain tried to go for my feet (dumbass)"
Crag says, "So I kicked him again and Jim stabbed him again"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "We got some good rolls then, so it was over pretty quick"
stormagnet says, "NIIIICE"
Crag says, "dude was NOT getting back up"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "It's a good thing too"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "you need your tender rib meats!"
Crag says, "I think the chick with the pistols might have been hard on Albanus otherwise"
Crag says, "I do!"
Crag says, "Oh, I probably didn't mention that the pistolier was a chick :)"
Crag says, "Blackpowder Betty, they called her"
stormagnet says, "you did"
Crag says, "Oh ok, cool"
stormagnet says, "indirectly, via prnouns :)"
stormagnet says, "not the name, though"
Crag says, "Greg put a lot of heart into his NPCs :)"
stormagnet says, "I like the name"
Crag says, "Did I send you the game packet?"
stormagnet says, "he always does"
stormagnet says, "he's the best GM I've ever had"
stormagnet says, "yes"
Crag says, "heee!"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "I still haven't gotten it off my phone`to read, tho ^_^;;"
Crag says, "Check out the bottom of the packet, 'cause it covers the NPCs"
stormagnet will!
Crag says, "Oh ok"
stormagnet says, "I'm suddenly really sleepy again"
Crag says, "I'm kinda bummed that we never met the other NPC"
Crag says, "Oh noes!"
stormagnet might need a nap
stormagnet says, "aw!"

Crag says, "Well that's pretty much it for Greg's game so far anyway"

Crag says, "All the stone dice are priced the same"
Crag says, "Or rather, all the stone dice that are available as 10 d10s"
Crag says, "alright, I've decided"
Crag says, "I will get the obsidian now, and if gaming goes well I will get myself the hematite later. :)"

Crag says, "We should decide what we want to do with this offer tonight and then I can call them tomorrow to let them know."
Crag says, "And we can order tickets tonight or whatever."
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "I want to come home for christmas"
Crag says, "I'm scheduled to be on-call the 25th of December to the 1st."
stormagnet says, "definitely"
stormagnet says, "weeeeak"
Crag says, "But I could probably reschedule"
stormagnet says, "I bet you co loses"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "Christmas in Japan is... not remotely the same as in the US"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "and besides that"
stormagnet says, "I would want to visit with them, after they went so far as to spring for my air fare!"
Crag says, "Yeah, I thought so too"
Crag says, "And I might still be able to visit in the spring or something"
stormagnet says, "and I told the Ic before I left that I would try to get home for xmas so I could check in with my doctors then"
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "Ok, so here's the plan then"
stormagnet says, "visiting in the spring will be WAY more fun, I assure you"
Crag says, "Sakura blossems!"
Crag says, "The plan"
stormagnet says, "ES!"
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "You make the arrangements with oshito and Machiko and school and whatever"
Crag says, "and buy the plane tickets"
Crag says, "If there's not enough money in checking move the $500 over from savings"
Crag says, "I will call your grandparents tomorrow to make a date to meet them for dinner and get the check from them"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "When you know what the dates will be let me know and I will try to get time off and all that"
stormagnet checks airfare now
Crag says, "Your Grandfather said this is for xmas and your birthday combined, btw :)"
stormagnet says, "I can get discount tickets through the school, too"
Crag says, "sweeeet"
Crag says, "I MISS YOU SO MUCH!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I can't wait to see you again"
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet says, "I was dreaming about you :)"
Crag says, "I'm going to kiss you so much you'll look like you were attacked by an octopus or something"
Crag says, "aw!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "wow..."
Crag says, "good wow or bad wow?"
stormagnet says, "I found a discount site with a fare of $964"
stormagnet says, "I might jump on that"
stormagnet says, "that's *with* taxes and fees"
stormagnet says, "the others were close to double that"
Crag says, "ah"
Crag says, "I just paid the speakeasy bill and had a safeway.com order, so I should check our balance..."
Crag says, "I _think_ we're fine, but I want to be sure."
Crag says, "If we move the savings back over we're OK"
Crag says, "Available is $890"
Crag says, "Versus $1344 regular balance"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Not sure about the difference there"
Crag says, "Oh, storage probably posted"
Crag says, "that plus speakeasy plus... something"
stormagnet says, "I apparantly have to tack on a $50 'membership' charge to this discount site"
Crag says, "I'll review tomorrow"
Crag pfft
Crag says, "That sounds kinda shadey"
stormagnet pokes around for comparison
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Hm, storage already posted"
Crag says, "Not sure what the $400 difference is about"
stormagnet says, "I took some out"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet says, "but only $200"
Crag says, "I'm not seeing the safeway order either, so maybe that showed up today."
Crag says, "And isn't in the transaction list yet"
Crag says, "That would account for almost another $200"
stormagnet says, "and there was about 460 after that for medicine"
stormagnet says, "nbot 4"
stormagnet says, "$"
stormagnet says, "$60"
stormagnet says, "as for airfare"
Crag says, "ok, we're cool then"
Crag says, "yes?"
stormagnet says, "either way, I will check with the school discount office first, I think"
stormagnet says, "but I"m grabbing comparisons"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "Oh, and I get paid tonight"
Crag says, "So tomorrow we should have an available balance of about $2k"
Crag says, "not including savings"
Crag says, "So we're in great shape."
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Heh, Jean was trying to get me to surprise visit you"
Crag says, "I was actually considering it, too, but this is better."
Crag says, "I'm just not very good at surprises"

stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "if I can get it early"
Crag says, "it would be more romantic for me to visit in the spring, right?"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "We'll have to see what we can do about that."
stormagnet says, "plus, then I have that nice long block off from school"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "and the weather is nicer in spring"
Crag says, "And you don't have the strong home associations with spring that you do with winter5"
Crag . o O ( FIVE )
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "precisely"
stormagnet says, "besides, Seattle in spring is pretty crap"
stormagnet says, "compared to Japan, anyway"
Crag nodsnods

stormagnet the plot is too complex
stormagnet says, "er"
stormagnet says, "we might lose track of things"
stormagnet says, "it'd be hard to switch back and forth between those two moods"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "considering this artist's history, and how her stuff has ramped up to Nana, I wonder what her next story will be like?!"

Crag says, "In the sense that they have information about english, french and italian staff"
stormagnet says, "oh hell yes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it is a media monster"
Crag says, "And the manga has english, french, italian, AND spanish, german and dutch companies."
Crag says, "So maybe there's more and we won't see it until it gets to netflix"
stormagnet says, "hmmmmm"
Crag says, "It's not on netflix yet (just checked :)"
stormagnet says, "the website only mentions through 47"

stormagnet O_O
stormagnet says, "sudden skip forward?"
Crag says, "yeah, like... 5 years?"
stormagnet says, "6+"
Crag says, "that's one way to wrap everything up, I guess"
stormagnet says, "if the kid is 6 years"

Crag says, "what... the... heck."
stormagnet nods

Crag says, "So maybe she just ran off to Europe or something?"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "SO UNCLEAR"
stormagnet says, "I'm confused"
Crag says, "I'm glad you're confused too"
stormagnet says, "did she and Ren get married"
Crag says, "I'm utterly baffled"
stormagnet says, "and why would that stop her?"
stormagnet says, "?!"
Crag says, "FIRST SEASON again"
stormagnet says, "FIRST appearance?!"
Crag says, "dammit, they're toying with us"
stormagnet says, "they ARE!"
stormagnet says, "ah"
Crag says, "So the story continues in the manga then?"
stormagnet says, "I have serious trouble believing they couldn't get continued!!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And maybe they'll animate more when they feel like it?"
stormagnet says, "that seems to be pretty common"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "well"
stormagnet says, "but the Nana series is such a media monster"
stormagnet says, "the bands that broke through it are HUGE here"
Crag says, "that 5, 10, 20 years thing makes it sound like Nana is still alive and could come back any time"
stormagnet NODS!
Crag says, "So what the hell was everyone sad about?"
stormagnet says, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND?"
Crag says, "that they couldn't talk about"
stormagnet says, "did the band break up?"
Crag says, "oh... that could be"
Crag says, "That would be a big deal"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet is hella confused
Crag says, "And maybe Nana couldn't deal with her feelings for Hachi so she ran away without staying in touch"
stormagnet will get lots of manga!
Crag says, "yes, please do!"
Crag says, "And tell me what happens!"
stormagnet says, "I will translate it for you"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yays!"

Crag laughs
Crag says, "I could do that."
stormagnet ^_^
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet hugs!!!

Crag says, "I was thinking of other series."
stormagnet says, "aw poo"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "So, 3 and 4!"
Crag says, "Let me know when you're ready to start :)"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Was that nod the ready indication?"
stormagnet says, "not yet ^_^;"
Crag says, "oh ok"
stormagnet says, "I was checking real qyick to see if there was anything I should queue while I watch"
Crag says, "I should delete stuff you've successfully transferred"
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "ok :)"
stormagnet says, "I delete after I watch, too"
stormagnet says, "but we have backups elsewhere, right?"
Crag says, "I also need to order that drive"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I've been keeping the really good stuff"

stormagnet wakes
stormagnet pokes
stormagnet says, "back from McLeoding yet?"
stormagnet waits :)
stormagnet says, "I got the actual price on that Northwest Airlines deal"
stormagnet | $770.00 plus tax/fuel $299.00 plus weekend fee $25.00 x2
stormagnet |
stormagnet | Total: $1119.00
stormagnet says, "I think I might be able to do better, but this is about what I was estimating before"
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "bit of a stupid question, but"
stormagnet says, "our apartment is #211, right?"
stormagnet can't quite remember
stormagnet says, "I found a free aspect of this cfares site that makes it seem worth using"
stormagnet says, "you register for a free account, let them know what you'd be willing to pay for a ticket"
stormagnet says, "and when their search finds one, they place a 24-hour hold on it"
stormagnet says, "if you want the ticket, you still eventually have to pay the $50 membership charge"
stormagnet says, "but when you're guaranteed the ticket in return, it doesn't seem as shady"
stormagnet says, "but I need to register with my address..."
stormagnet puts down 211
stormagnet says, "has your night life endurance increased?"
stormagnet says, "or did I miss you already?"
Crag says, "todaima!"
Crag says, "Yes, 224 Pontius Ave N #211"
Crag says, "Thursdays are happy hour with Ty, Reva and whoever else makes it nights"
Crag says, "Tonight Reva's Nick and Ben made it."
Crag says, "We sortof did a pub crawl, by accident"
Crag says, "Ended up at Dante's eventually where we played a lot of air hockey"
Crag says, "I had to leave because there were a couple of college chicks on the dance floor making out and I was about to cum in my pants."
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "plus it's late"
Crag feeds cats
Crag says, "The primary reason my tolerance was not exhausted is that the party size never grew beyond four"
Crag says, "Reva left before Ben showed up, then Ty left before Reva got back from her german club meeting."
Crag says, "So there was always decent spontaneous conversation, Ty not withstanding."
Crag emails you to let you know he's online...
Usage:  `<target> <message>
Crag says, "haha, Christian and Dylan are registered at Amazon. :)  Baby's due in December."
Crag says, "Oh, I made plans to have dinner with your grandparents tomorrow, and after that I'm going to meet Lindsey at a party at Ty's, but we're going to run off together right away and do something we're actually interested in, whatever that might be."
Crag says, "Maybe rent a movie or something."
Crag says, "heee!  Available balance on BofA is 1998.90, and that's after I put $51 on the card tonight."
Crag says, "And not including the $500 I put in the 'savings' account."
Crag says, "so yay!"
stormagnet was afk taking a pooooo
Crag says, "poo!"
Crag says, "I am still awake!"
Crag says, "It's amazing!"
Crag says, "And I'm still a little tipsy!"
stormagnet says, "awesome!"
Crag says, "And keen on using exclamation marks!"
Crag!
stormagnet says, "your social life sounds like it's really picking up :)"
Crag says, "MAYbe..."
Crag says, "I'm cautiously optimistic"
stormagnet says, "it sounds like a damn good start :)"
Crag says, "I'm not complaining :)"
stormagnet says, "pegging the group size as your tolerance point is really good progress"
stormagnet says, "the pub crawl sounds like a lot of fun"
stormagnet says, "I'm cautiously optomistic about my cold being over"
stormagnet says, "especially as I've been knocked out for about a week now O_o"
stormagnet would like to have a social life too....
Crag says, "The tolerance point discovery was an accident of your observation of my tolerance seeming to be higher"
Crag says, "yeah!"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet is glad to be of service
Crag says, "I'm still thinking you will make some friends through tutoring"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm just finishing moving all my RSS feeds from Sage to google's reader"
stormagnet says, "is google's reader good?"
Crag says, "You remember how I was talking about having a comic reader that would just keep the old stuff?"
Crag says, "That's google's reader"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "only way better"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
Crag says, "it's... googletastic"
stormagnet says, "does google handle stuff that doesn't make its own feed?"
Crag says, "It is, as we say, 'the shit'"
Crag says, "Don't know about that"
stormagnet . o O ( if anybody did, it would be them )
Crag says, "But there are ways of feed-ifying things..."
stormagnet says, "I didn't really think so"
Crag says, "I haven't tried"
stormagnet says, "ooooh"
Crag says, "I'm just moving my sage feeds first"
Crag says, "I have one more to move :)"
stormagnet says, "wanna watch something?"
stormagnet says, "or just chat, as it's so late :)"
Crag says, "oh..."
Crag says, "I think we should just chat :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I want to watch something, but it's REALLY late"
stormagnet understands entirely :)
Crag says, "And I can't stay late at work 'cause I'm meeting your grandparents"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But we can watch lots this weekend!"
stormagnet says, "you should really go to bed soon"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "But I need chats!"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "what kind of stuff did you guys chat about?"
Crag says, "oh let's see..."
Crag says, "We talked about ourselves a lot"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "always a popular topic!"
Crag says, "naturally"
Crag says, "That was mostly Reva and Ty and me."
Crag says, "Reva said I seemed a little prickly"
Crag says, "Which I took to mean on edge"
Crag says, "Which I attributed to missing you"
Crag says, "Things got more interesting when Ben showed up"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "Somewhat"
Crag says, "Ben and I talked about Greg's game a bit :)"
Crag says, "We filled in Nick and Reva on what's so great about good gaming"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I explained about not thinking gaming could be much fun because I hadn't understood about the narative aspects"
Crag says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "about time somebody got them interested, in my book"
Crag says, "We argued with Nick about Kill Bill"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Nick said he didn't like the balance of action and dialog in the two volumes"
Crag says, "And Ben and I argued that they should not even be considered to be separate movies at all"
stormagnet says, "god yes"
Crag says, "That that's just the industry's cowardace"
stormagnet says, "that breaks the flow"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "And that Tarrantino made them as a single movie"
Crag says, "He never understood"
Crag says, "But I enjoyed emphatically agreeing with Ben"
Crag says, "Ben and I explained the wonders of Neil Stephenson to Reva and Nick"
stormagnet says, "the first contains the majority of the exposition arc"
stormagnet says, "etc"
Crag says, "Exactly!"
stormagnet says, "taking them as seperate breaks the structure entirely"
Crag says, "Nick saw the first one as all action and the second all dialog"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I said that the action in the first set the scene"
Crag says, "And that the excitement in the second was only possible because of the context of the first"
Crag says, "and so on"
stormagnet says, "finding common ground with Ben and arguing for it is the best way to build a stronger relationship with him :)"
Crag says, "Ben pointed out various elements that tied together through the whole 'tapestry'"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
Crag says, "Ben and I are getting along quite well lately!"
Crag says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "excellent!"
Crag says, "I told Ben about your grandparents' gift and your pending visit"
Crag says, "And he mentioned that he thought he knew how that came about:"
Crag says, "He had been at family dinner and your mom had been bitching about you not visiting"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Ben defended you and me, pointing out that I was supporting both of us while you were studying in one of the most expensive cities in the world."
Crag says, "And then a couple nights later your grandfather called me :)"
stormagnet says, "good on him!"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I was quite pleased"
Crag says, "I commended him most heartilly"
Crag says, "Also"
stormagnet says, "and nevermind the stagarring expense of sudden disability"
stormagnet says, "or te fact that mom's house is still inaccessible.."
Crag says, "He sorta let slip that he's been saving money like crazy and has a rediculous checking account balance."
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Nick and I heaped lots of money advice on him much to his embarressment"
Crag says, "But he appreciated it and seemed to like what we were saying"
stormagnet says, "he's been doing good at keeping that under wraps"
Crag says, "Mostly me, actually"
Crag heh
Crag says, "what else"
Crag says, "We had ice cream"
stormagnet says, "YAY"
Crag says, "While Nick and I were getting ice cream Reva and Ben lamented about Case"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Specifically that Case is screwing Reva's financial situation because she co-signed his car loan"
stormagnet says, "eep"
Crag says, "And he's already declared bankruptcy"
stormagnet says, "daaaaamn"
Crag says, "So she can either pay $9m or declare bankruptcy herself"
Crag says, "ER"
Crag says, "$9k"
Crag says, "not million :)"
stormagnet figured
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "that's horrible"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Case... well.  I don't know what to say"
Crag says, "I feel like the optimist in Mr. Despair"
Crag says, "How could I know someone like that?"
stormagnet says, "and Case, being white and male, is a hell of a lot more likely to recover from a financial blow like that"
Crag says, "It's impossible!"
Crag says, "well yeah"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Plus he's working for tips and selling drugs"
Crag says, "So he's living mostly off the grid"
stormagnet says, "I think he has no real concept of the magnitude of how horrifically he fucked her by doing that"
Crag says, "I don't know what he thinks"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
stormagnet says, "I'm sad, but not really surprised, to hear that's where he wound up"
Crag too
Crag says, "Moving on from there we ended up at Dante's"
stormagnet says, "he pry thinks he's in some cheesy Shadowrun novel"
Crag says, "gah, yeah"
Crag says, "I can see him having various fantasies"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Reva says he tries to blame her for everything"
Crag says, "it's sickening"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "Things brightened up when we got to Dante's"
Crag says, "We played a LOT"
Crag says, "My fingers are still sore"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I won three and lost two games"
Crag says, "Or maybe it was 3-3... or 4-2"
Crag says, "I can't quite remember!"
Crag says, "After I won my second game I lost track"
stormagnet says, "better not to"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "it was a blast!"
stormagnet says, "keeping track is lame :)"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "It was fun seeing how differently everyone played"
stormagnet nods1
Crag says, "And then Ben coached me a bit and I did much better"
Crag says, "Ben is The Thinker"
Crag says, "Reva is Buddha"
Crag says, "Nick is The Warrior"
Crag says, "And I am The Spaz"
Crag says, "I guess"
Crag says, "That's how I saw it anyway"
Crag says, "Ben and Reva's games were kinda slow because they kept waiting for the right moment to strike"
Crag says, "Games between Nick and me were pretty fast"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Nick and I were prone to throwing our paddles"
Crag says, "the drinking didn't help :)"
Crag says, "Ben was remarkably uncompetitive"
Crag says, "Nick was the most competitive"
Crag says, "He demanded a rematch against me after I barely won a game near the end of the evening"
Crag says, "And then I trounced him!"
stormagnet LAUGHS!
Crag says, "Both of those wins I attribute to Ben's coaching"
Crag says, "He pointed out some neat stuff about the areas of the field"
Crag says, "areas where on the sides where bounces don't matter and stuff"
Crag says, "It helped me focus and get less panicky"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I'm sure we'll go back again sooner or later.  Everyone seemed to be having a really good time."
stormagnet says, "Ben sounds like he's matured a LOT"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "I was thinking that too"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag smiles.
Crag says, "So then"
Crag says, "Then there were girls on the dance floor making out, and it was too much"
Crag says, "It was so hot"
Crag says, "They weren't like sorority chicks or anything"
Crag says, "Just a couple of normal college girls, sucking face"
Crag says, "and that was only after they'd been dancing together for 15 minutes or so"
Crag says, "which had also been pretty hot"
stormagnet says, "dang"
Crag says, "One of them had sorta been dancing with some guy at first, I think the three of them were together"
Crag says, "But they ended up ignoring the guy completely by the time I was ready to leave"
Crag says, "pooru%poor guy!"
Crag doh
stormagnet giggles
Crag . o O ( poor guy! )
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "Watching them got me worried that my mood would turn down if I stayed, so I left."
Crag says, "And then I noticed I had a text message from Lindsey, and I texted her back and we talked and made plans to leave Ty's party early tomorrow night"
Crag says, "I don't know what we'll go do"
Crag says, "I've never hung out with just Lindsey before."
stormagnet says, "I think it"
stormagnet says, "aiugh"
stormagnet says, "it'll be good :)"
Crag . o O ( we need to do surgery on her enter key or apostrophy key )
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "I'll add it to the list"
Crag says, "I'm looking forward to it"
Crag says, "Today was kinda nice at work, too"
stormagnet says, "the hanging out, I assume :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "the hanging out :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "At work I had things to talk about in the team meeting for a change"
Crag says, "Usually I don't"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I finished the first phase of the post-split changes"
Crag says, "I updated all the sitescope monitors I could find that needed to be updated"
Crag says, "I estimate I still have a couple of weeks worth of updating of documentation and such to go"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But the sitescope monitors were the most imporant since that's where most of our tickets come from"
Crag says, "And a happy SOC is a helpful SOC"
Crag says, "And I had lunch with Scott from work and we talked about interesting projects"
Crag says, "I told him about BEM and related topics"
Crag says, "He's interested in automatically generated content"
Crag says, "So I told him about our MUD visions"
Crag says, "And he had similar thoughts he had been working on"
Crag says, "He has a lot of ideas"
stormagnet says, "cool!"
Crag says, "yeah, today was a long day!"
stormagnet says, "all full!"
stormagnet says, "go drink some water before you sleep tho!"
Crag says, "Good thinking"
stormagnet says, "and take some tylenol or something, while you're at it"
Crag says, "Though, I had a ton of water at Flowers, and my last drink was a carbomb"
stormagnet says, "just in case :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "can't hurt"
Crag says, "true"
Crag follows orders
stormagnet giggles
Crag brb :)
Crag says, "As always, the cats send their regards."
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
stormagnet says, "I had one of those hypnogogic things"
stormagnet says, "where I could have sworn I felt a cat walking on the bed"
Crag says, "weird!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I was still sleepy/dreaming enough that this didn't strike me as odd at all"
stormagnet says, "but I moved my hand towards where I though there was a kittah to pet it and woke myself the rest of the way up :/"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "kittah!"
Crag says, "ghost kittah"
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "They totally sleep with me now"
Crag says, "like, up against me"
Crag says, "glom"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet says, "the twin heaters"
Crag says, "with motors running"
stormagnet says, "with their motors rumbling"
Crag LAUGHS
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "We are in tune!"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I should head to bed now"
Crag says, "if I set my alarm for 10 I can still get eight hours sleep"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "I'm pretty sure you can safely spend up to $1500 on plane tickets"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I will still try and get something cheaper, though :)"
Crag says, "of course"
Crag says, "less is more :)"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "sleep well!!"
Crag says, "Should I assume you will arrive the 21st and depart the 29th?"
Crag says, "Should I try to get time off accordingly?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "that's the largest window I can get away with"
Crag says, "so it is written, so it shall be done!"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag grins.
Crag HUGS!!!
Crag says, "I can't wait to see you again"

Crag idles: back to partying
[Idling at 10:26 P.M. on Fri, Nov 9: back to partying]
stormagnet says, "yay! partying!"
stormagnet did post a link, a while ago
stormagnet says, "I guess I need to post it on the front ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "I haven't really updated for shit, though, so it's no big loss ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "speaking of which, any news on posting via email?"
stormagnet idles: running out to get a replacement cellphone charger >_<
Crag rewakes briefly
Crag says, "Yeah, post it somewhere where it won't scroll off"
Crag says, "No news on posting via email, it's waiting for the server rebuild which is waiting for the hard drive I haven't ordered yet."
Crag reidles
[Idling at 12:10 A.M. on Sat, Nov 10: back to partying]
stormagnet pokes
stormagnet says, "you asleep?"
stormagnet is back from getting a phone charger
stormagnet says, "WHOA"
stormagnet found one of those little-bottle energy/medicine drinks that really works
stormagnet says, "for sore throats"
stormagnet says, "this thing is basically a single-shit cough syrup"
stormagnet says, "but DAMN it is effective"
stormagnet might have to bring a bunch back home O_O
stormagnet says, "man, if this is seriously herbal, than there's some herb that out there that packs a serious punch"
stormagnet says, "my tongue is numb!"
stormagnet says, "but this is excellent stuff- I wish I'd tried it sooner, I might have made it to class some of last week >_<"
stormagnet is watching Claymore
stormagnet says, "I was a little surprised- it's different from what I expected from your description"
stormagnet says, "but in retrospect, my filter was off"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I think it's actually a really good series"
stormagnet says, "high quality animation, narrative, acting, the works"
stormagnet says, "but it's not a *happy* anime"
stormagnet says, "and not a cute one, either"
stormagnet says, "and I can see lots of places that would be hard on a Roberty"
stormagnet says, "I'm surprised you watched it through on your own, without my suggesting it or watching it or anything"
stormagnet says, "that's some huge progress!!"
stormagnet says, "and now you understand my thing about finishing things I start, too"
stormagnet says, "even the things so unbelievably crappy that I gave uip after one episode aren't really so much filed in my head as 'given up' as 'bottom of the list'"
stormagnet says, "which just ends up being equivalent, since my list is so long"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "but I'm really enjoying it"
stormagnet says, "thanks for recommending it!"
Crag back, and still partying!
Crag reads scroll
Crag says, "I didn't think Claymore was well animated at all, but in retrospect I did like the acting."
Crag says, "But maybe I had the wrong set and setting"
Crag says, "I'm glad you like it :)"
Crag says, "I guess I liked it too."
Crag says, "Maybe I'll upgrade my rating on ANN"

Crag says, "I hope you come back online tonight"
Crag says, "I'm at Ty's place and I think I'm going to end up crashing on his couch"
Crag says, "We're celebrating Tiffany's birthday and things are pretty interesting"
Crag reidles for a bit
[Idling at 2:19 A.M. on Sat, Nov 10: back to partying]
stormagnet wakes!
stormagnet resizes for simultaneous enjoyment :)
stormagnet says, "couch crashing?!"
stormagnet says, "WOW"
stormagnet says, "you're improving fast!!"
stormagnet is impressed! ^_^
stormagnet says, "this really is a growing experience for both of us"
stormagnet says, "I think I might have actually been slowing you down"
stormagnet says, "the comfort zone was too comfortable, or something"
stormagnet says, "and not having to worry about my medical crap certainly adds to the simultanaeity"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "Fill me in on some of the interesting stuff later, if it still comes to mind"
stormagnet says, "though I realize most is too much in the moment to really make sense later"
stormagnet says, "context dependant, and all that"
Crag finally arrives home
Crag says, "I haven't really slept yet, so I'll fill you in later"
Crag says, "Though"
Crag says, "the Ty's couch plan fell through and I ended up on Ethen's couch watching Firefly"
Crag says, "And I was going to just sleep there, but work called at 6am"
Crag says, "I didn't have to do anything, but it broke my resolve to crash where I was"
Crag says, "So I walked home (45 minutes)"
Crag says, "and now I'm feeding cats and sleeping"
Crag idles: feeding sleep and catting
[Idling at 6:47 A.M. on Sat, Nov 10: feeding sleep and catting]
stormagnet says, "daaaamn"
stormagnet says, "sorry to hear things didn't work out, but well done!!"
stormagnet says, "was Ethan's couch narsty, or has he gotten a little bit better about that?"
stormagnet says, "good exercise, too!"
stormagnet says, "have you gotten better shoes yet?"
stormagnet says, "if you go to a sports shoe store, and get a consultation, you can pry find something that will help a LOT"
stormagnet says, "and if you're feeling stingy"
stormagnet says, "(which I bet you aren't, but)"
stormagnet says, "you can go in, get a fitting, get a recommendation, then tell them you're going to shop around"
stormagnet says, "find a better price, and give them the chance to beat it :)"
stormagnet says, "on the exensive, worth-the-investment sort of shoes, they tend to be willing"
stormagnet says, "since even after talking them down, you'll likely be dropping at least $100"
stormagnet says, "and if you wear them consistantly, you'll likely need repairs or a new pair in 6 months, depending on what kind you get"
stormagnet says, "I recommend shelling for some really, really good boots"
stormagnet says, "since you can get those repaired"
stormagnet says, "whereas sneaker-style walking shoes have to be replaced"
stormagnet says, "our plan covers podiatry, so you might even want to consider some custom insoles"
stormagnet says, "but a good cork insole with a hard leather instep lasts pretty good"
stormagnet says, "and from what I recal, you have pretty flat feet, so rather than worrying about arch support wearing down, getting one with a good fitting arch will be hardest"
stormagnet says, "hem"
stormagnet says, "anyway..."
stormagnet says, "I'm glad you had a good time!"
stormagnet says, "lurve the kittahs for me!"
stormagnet says, "ooh- btw"
stormagnet says, "#20 isn't in the Claymore directory"
stormagnet says, "ooh-hey, Hayaye no Gotoku #32 is out! Do we have that yet?"
stormagnet says, "and we should download clannad and rental magica :)"
stormagnet says, "Holy Shit!"
stormagnet says, "there's a Hataraki Man anime!!"
stormagnet says, "we definitely need that ^_^"
stormagnet says, "I've been enjoying the live-action version immensely :)"
stormagnet watches Baccano, in absence of Claymore #20
stormagnet !!!!!
stormagnet says, "I"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "I'm sure you mentioned this already, but"
stormagnet says, "Otousan!!!"
stormagnet says, "The Cat Dad!!!"
stormagnet says, "AGAIN"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "Off the bat, I'd have to say"
stormagnet says, "this beginning has a surprisingly Stephenson-esque flair to it"
stormagnet says, "WHOA"
stormagnet says, "there are a LOT of familar voices in this one"
Crag says, "huh, I wonder if I missed claymore 20.  I'll queue it up and maybe watch it too."
Crag queus up hayate 32 as well
Crag says, "I've just queued up the last episode of La Corda d'Oro p"
Crag says, "~primo passo~"
Crag says, "so we can finish that at some point too"
Crag says, "So... clannad"
Crag says, "I watched the first two episodes and found it terribly slow, but it seems to be very popular..."
Crag says, "I guess I'll go ahead and queue it up"
Crag says, "And yeah, Baccano is pretty great too"
Crag says, "I've only seen the first episode so far, so we might want to try to watch that together too."
Crag says, "I need to order that damn hard drive..."
Crag says, "and yes, I should get good shoews."
Crag says, "shoes"
Crag says, "maybe I'll do that before heading up for the saturday jam"
Crag says, "D.Gray-man looks pretty good and I've only watched one episode of that, but there are 56 episodes otu and I don't think I have space for it right now :)"
Crag says, "alright, everything's queued up and the downloads are running at full speed"
Crag says, "what can I say about last night"
Crag says, "My original plan had been to hang out with just Lindsey.  We hadn't figured out what we were going to do, just that it would be cheap."
Crag says, "Then Ty invited us both to Tiff's birthday party.  Lindsey was at work, so all we had was text messages and she was too busy to send many of those Thursday night, so we didn't talk about what to do Friday until after I left Dante's."
Crag says, "We made a plan to meet at Ty's place to make an appearence and then go do something else."
Crag says, "Thursday while hanging out Ty had offered me his couch to crash on, which I tentatively accepted."
Crag says, "Friday I showed up at Ty's before anyone else except Tiff."
Crag says, "I talked with Tiff a bunch about anime and manga and in the process decided that she might be Interesting after all."
Crag says, "I had not formed a very good impression of her previously."
Crag says, "Other people showed up, there was lots of interesting conversation, but again I preferred to have fewer than five people in a room at a time."
Crag says, "Lindsey finally showed up and after eating some dinner she'd brought she decided she was too tired to do anything with me, and I agreed that I was pretty tired too, so we made plans to get together Monday night instead."
Crag says, "At that point my plan was back to crashing on Ty's couch."
Crag says, "Then more people showed up"
Crag says, "Actually, I remember now that more people showed up later than that."
Crag says, "ANyway, we around 1am Tiff said she wanted to go to a bar, so the six of us went to Dante's."
Crag says, "The other three were Ben, Brendan (or Branden or something) and a guy named Graham I had not met before."
Crag says, "At Dante's Ben bought a round and we got a table.  There were shots and pitchers coming and going until closing time."
Crag says, "Maybe we got there closer to midnight, I don't remember now :)"
Crag says, "While we were there more people showed up at Ty's place and waited for us there."
Crag says, "The more people were Shea, Katie, Ethan and three people Ethan had met since Haloween."
Crag says, "The three people were kinda interesting"
Crag says, "One was a girl named Jennifer whom I assume Ethan was interested in.  She was sortof clinging to a guy named Shawn/Sean who SEEMED to be flaming gay, but the subject didn't come up."
Crag says, "Ethen had met those two a few days before, but the third guy, Isaac, was new to him too.  But he also seemed to be the coolest one of the bunch."
Crag says, "So with 12 people packed into Ty's apartment the party was NOT WINDING DOWN."
Crag says, "Ethan and Ben and I went on a mission to get crackers for Tiff, whose innards were complaining about their unfair treatment."
Crag says, "Oh, and Ty made a bong by drilling a hole in a glass beer bottle."
Crag says, "So there was a lot of pot smoking."
Crag says, "Some time around 3 or 4, Tiff told me she thought Ty was getting irritated that people were showing no signs of leaving"
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "I don't know if that's true, but since it's her birthday party I took it as an indication that she thought people should go for whatever reason"
Crag says, "Oh, and she insisted that Ben and I put her number in our phones, which we happily did."
Crag says, "Actually, Tiff put her number in my phone and then I gave it to Ben to copy, but at her request."
Crag says, "I think I may be organizing a Friday Movie Night at Alley 24"
Crag says, "Movies or Anime or whatever"
Crag says, "Since Tiff seemed to think folks should leave, I passed the word on to others"
Crag says, "Ben and I tried to drag Ethan out, and once Ethan started going, the three people he'd brought came along."
Crag says, "Shea and Katie had left earlier, so that just left Tiff and Brendan."
Crag says, "When I left Tiff was obviously planning on sleeping in Ty's bed (don't know what intentions other than sleeping, if any, she had)."
Crag says, "Brendan and Ty were having a Very Important Conversation about something (gag)"
Crag says, "so the six of us (me, Ben, Ethan and his new friends) made a plan to take a cab to Ethan's"
Crag says, "But then Ethan's friends decided they were going to split the party, so Ben and Ethan and I took the first cab to Ethan's and we don't know what the others did."
Crag says, "At Ethan's we watched the first episode of Firefly"
Crag says, "THen I half fell asleep on the couch"
Crag says, "And work woke me up after a few minutes"
Crag says, "and I walked home, fed the cats and crashed out on the bed, the end."
Crag says, "Ethan's place wasn't ... TOO nasty..."
Crag says, "he has a cute kitty"
Crag says, "v.kyute"
Crag says, "All I remember about Jennifer was that she reminded me of some actress I can't remember and that she was pissed because some ex-friend of hers had hyjacked her youtube account."
Crag says, "Isaac was just mature, quiet but still extroverted, and funny."
Crag says, "Sean was just obnoxiously flaming and only seemed to be interested in playing bad music on Ty's computer."
Crag says, "Graham was WAY TOO LOUD and not too bright but otherwise a nice guy."
Crag says, "affable is the word that comes to mind"
Crag says, "Nicole, Nate and Morgain made a very brief appearence"
Crag says, "Nicole is not going to law school afterall"
Crag says, "I want to strangle her"
Crag says, "she's still not planning on staying at DIG"
Crag says, "I'm going to try to talk some sense into her"
Crag says, "To wit: stay at DIG until you have definitely made up your mind, THEN go do whatever you're going to do."
Crag says, "Oh, I got the story of the night a little wrong.  Shea and Katie showed up and left BEFORE we went to Dante's"
Crag says, "They didn't really say or do anything noteworthy at the party."
Crag says, "I guess that's the whole story."
Crag says, "and now I think about food and chores"
Crag says, "I don't think I care for either of them :)"
Crag idles: saturday music session at Ty's
[Idling at 3:03 P.M. on Sat, Nov 10: saturday music session at Ty's]

stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "how was music?"
Crag says, "pretty bad"
Crag says, "It was basically just Ty and me.  I guess Tiff doesn't play"
Crag says, "Katie didn't show up before I left."

stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "all running the same game"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "SO GOOD"
Crag says, "TOo much intrigue for a ready-run I think"
stormagnet says, "but the premise is so elementally simple"
stormagnet says, "it accomodates it"
stormagnet says, "the players make their own"
stormagnet says, "what the fuck"
Crag grins.

stormagnet says, "they don't get slopppy"
Crag says, "It's consistent"
stormagnet says, "that's always jarring"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "mark of a cheap production"
Crag says, "I also prefer these shows where they don't cheat by showing a lot of stills with pans and zooms for potion"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but I prefer that to crappy in-betweens"
Crag says, "yeah, that's true"
Crag says, "But shows like this are on a whole different level"

stormagnet says, "but they gave them some funny accents"
Crag says, "Of course there are"
Crag says, "I bet!"
Crag says, "However"
Crag says, "I think this show would actually be pretty good dubbed"
Crag says, "Because all the people are so obviously western"

Crag says, "Your holiday visit should be full of seeing friends and doing stuff around town"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "and down time should be cuddling and video games!"
Crag says, "ZOMG, GAMES"
Crag says, "we have no way to play gamecube or playstation in the apartment yet"
Crag says, "we may have to do something about that :)"
Crag says, "capture card for ildana maybe"

stormagnet says, "we need one of those either way"
stormagnet says, "a nice high definition one, if possible"
Crag says, "I suppose"
Crag says, "I don't know much about that"
Crag says, "What would we capture besides video games?"
stormagnet says, "they've gotten really cheap"
Crag says, "We'll never get cable"
stormagnet says, "what with the 'media center' push"
stormagnet says, "oh hell no, no cable"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I hadn't even considered that effect"

Crag says, "Sounds good!"
stormagnet says, "we'd only have MORE trouble keeping the threads straight if we mix in something else :P"
Crag says, "That's a good point"
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "I'm not too hopeful that I'll ever follow it"
Crag says, "This is almost as complicated as Lain! :)"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "we need to rewatch that someday"
stormagnet says, "now that you've got more of a feel for this kind of thing :)"
Crag says, "yes"
Crag says, "We should rewatch everything you originally showed me"

Crag says, "that's true too"
stormagnet looks forward to it
stormagnet says, "kore kara mo yoroshiku!"
Crag says, "I remember thinking back then how easy it was to trust you and how much and deeply I did"
Crag says, "And now I trust you even more, and I never would have thought it possible"
stormagnet blushes
Crag says, "I have far more faith in my model of you than any other aspect of the universe."
stormagnet . o O ( shucks )
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "thank you :)"
stormagnet says, "I have a similar feeling for you"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I was shocked myself at how fast and hard I trusted you"
stormagnet says, "we just fit"
Crag says, "exactly"
Crag says, "And unlike other relationships of mine, your trust in me didn't and doesn't bother me in any way"
stormagnet says, "from an outside perspective, I did some pretty insane things"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "but from our perspective it was all obvious"
Crag says, "Not even desperate like it seemed or anything"
stormagnet says, "yeah :)"
Crag says, "Just natural"
stormagnet says, "I'm learning to trust not just your character and emotions but also your resiliance"
stormagnet says, "you've come a long way that way"
Crag says, "that's true too."
stormagnet says, "I feel like our team is level milling, or something"
Crag says, "I've been impressed with how you've re-molded yourself"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "totally!"
Crag says, "We rule!"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "We've both given each other serious feedback and we've both taken it seriously"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It means a lot to me to be on both ends of that"
stormagnet says, "and we're both challenging our weak points"
Crag says, "It's the closest thing I have to bravery"
Crag says, "yep"
Crag says, "But with so much trust on hand, it's a little easier"
stormagnet says, "and finding ways to build on our strengths"
stormagnet nods
Crag nods and smiles.
Crag says, "You are a marvelous being"
stormagnet says, "so are you"
stormagnet says, "anyone less adaptible wouldn't keep up :)"
Crag says, "yes, I admit it."
Crag says, "I know exactly what you mean"
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
Crag says, "I'm starting to feel it too"
stormagnet says, "that, in and of itself, is a huge improvement :)"
Crag says, "The distance while you're over there has also helped me see myself a little better"
Crag says, "because I can't avoid looking at myself"
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "There's nobody else to look at"
Crag says, "And I don't seem as bad as I remeber"

Crag idles: off to game
[Idling at 9:11 A.M. on Sun, Nov 11: off to game]
Crag wakes
Crag says, "Game was good, but somewhat expositional"
Crag says, "Game started with the four of us coming to in the brig of Captain Morgan's ship (several years after he's supposed to be dead)."
Crag says, "While we were in the middle of fighting our way out of the ship it came under attack and at one point it temporarily transformed into a huge fish."
Crag says, "We were knocked out by that and when we came to the ship was beached and heavily damaged."
Crag says, "We explored a bit, I had an astounding success climbing a bluff (natural 3 tens out of four d10s rolled).  Heh."
Crag says, "The island we landed on is dominated by a small tribe of spider worshipers"
Crag says, "Luckily the blindfolded guy was able to communicate with them telepathically"
Crag says, "And he got them to take us in.  They want us to stay forever, but we're working on a way to escape."
Crag says, "While I had been looking around on the bluff I had seen a longboat approaching.  We came up with an excuse for the villagers to let me go back to the beach where I met the guy in the boat who turned out to be a catholic priest who only speaks to pray."
Crag says, "I told him about some of our situation and asked him to hang out on the beach and try to make a smoke signal if any ships come by."
Crag says, "Then I went back into the jungle to join up with the rest of the party."
Crag says, "They fed us spider-based foods. :)"
Crag says, "The next morning we went out on a training hunt with them.  I made everyone laugh by capturing a "bride spider" which the women of the village use to earn the right to choose a mate, and to increase their fertility."
Crag says, "Later in the day there was an adult hunting party.  The blindfolded guy, whom I shal refer to as 'Al', was permitted to go along because they think he's our leader."
Crag says, "Jim (Ben's charachter) was permitted to go along because he had his own sword already so they assumed he had earned it hunting."
Crag says, "Aza (Shea's charachter) and I were told to stay in the village."
Crag says, "Jim impressed the hunters by capturing an impressive specimine of the dog-sized spiders which they use as their primary food."
Crag says, "That night Jim snuck into their temple where he learned more of their creation 'myth' from some pictograms on the wall.  He also found what appeared to be a sacraficial alter.  There was a ring on this alter which when he described it, a vivid image of it appeared in my mind."
Crag says, "I intend to aquire this ring. :)"
Crag says, "acquire"
Crag says, "That's all for that session"
Crag says, "Er, Marco is eating cardboard."
Crag says, "why would he do that?"
Crag says, "I'm worried I might be getting sick, so I'm going to bed early"
Crag says, "But I may wake up early, so if you want me to send mail to your phone when I wake up, let me know."
stormagnet says, "goddam it"
stormagnet says, "I got dizzy at school came home at lunch to put my feet up, and woke up..."
stormagnet says, "now"
stormagnet says, "7.5 hours, gone"
stormagnet says, "goddam it"
stormagnet says, "and now, I'm reading Achewood, and cursing Japan for not having any Subway"
stormagnet reads scroll
stormagnet says, "game sounds hilarious"
stormagnet says, "as does Marco"
stormagnet says, "I've seen him eat cardboard before, I wouldn't worry about it too much"
stormagnet says, "I think he just likes the biting involved"
stormagnet says, "there's certainly nothing in it that would hurt him"
stormagnet . o O ( mmmmm, fiber )
Crag wakes
Crag says, "Didn't sleep well.  Had some weird dreams and the cats bugged me."
Crag says, "But, if I pretend I really did sleep the whole time, it was more than 8 hours."
Crag says, "So it should be enough"
Crag says, "In one of the many weird parts of my dream I was watching a movie Shea had made about himself."
Crag says, "And the movie was interactive."
Crag says, "I was talking to charachters in the movie about their futures."
Crag says, "in another part of the movie there was some other piece of fiction I was interacting with (I'm not sure if it was a book or what) which had been written by the mom of some friends of mine I grew up with in Oregon."
Crag says, "And in yet another part I was playing a video game which was relatively low tech like a linux game, but had a strangely high level of interactivity and persistence."
Crag says, "It was an adventure game of some sort, kindof like nethack"
Crag says, "There were things to fight with combat like a nintendo game or even older, and treasure to loot"
Crag says, "And areas were randomly generated, but once generated stayed the same, like nethack"
Crag says, "But it had a three-dimensonal topology even within rooms"
Crag says, "I think a lot of this dreaming I can attribute to Greg's game."
Crag says, "SO let's see, it's 9:30pm over there..."

Crag says, "And maybe eat something for a change"
Crag says, "It will take me about 20 minutes before I'm heading out the door"
Crag says, "Er, and now I'm worried about leaving the computer cables alone with Marco!"
Crag says, "Crap!"
Crag frowns and pouts and stuff
Crag . o O ( doh, she prolly already minimized this window or something )
Crag says, "Well I guess I'm really going now"
Crag idles: stupid work
[Idling at 7:16 A.M. on Mon, Nov 12: stupid work]
stormagnet says, "d'oh"
stormagnet had, in fact, minimized >_<
stormagnet says, "sorry!"
stormagnet says, "oh my, there's some twins in Clannad an awful lot like the Luck Star girls"
stormagnet says, "oh my, I recognize`some of these voices"
stormagnet says, "you're right tho, this is way too slow for you"
stormagnet watches it so that you don't have to
Crag wakes from work
Crag says, "Oh good, I'm glad you're watching Clannad without me :)"
Crag says, "so sleepy"
[Idling at 9:36 A.M. on Mon, Nov 12: stupid work]
Crag says, "I ended up going home sick"
Crag says, "sore throat, brain fog, possible fever."
Crag idles: teh sick
[Idling at 12:08 P.M. on Mon, Nov 12: teh sick]
stormagnet . o O ( I'm not supposed to be contagious over teh internets! )
stormagnet idles: stoopid horsepisstal
Crag heh
Crag takes a bath
Crag . o O ( a pop-up book for children! )
Crag says, "done w/ bath"
Crag says, "I think you might like Sky Girls."
Crag says, "It's a little formulaic and cheesy, but it has its cute and funny bits too."
Crag checks disk space
Crag says, "definitely running low..."
Crag says, "Oh, some more game story I forgot.  The way I was captured was that some prostitutes lured me into an ambush. :)"
Crag says, "I hadn't said anything to Greg, but I think my charachter might be a virgin."
Crag says, "So that would fit."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I need your advice on what Edward's biases should be"
Crag says, "I'm going to paste an email I composed which I was going to send to Greg, but am not going to send because I'd rather get your input instead.  I think it will be more fun for everyone that way."
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
---------------------------------- Crag -----------------------------------
My knowledge of history is disturbingly weak, but I think Edward's response to the mute Catholic priest should probably have been less trusting and perhaps a little antagonistic.  I can justify it by saying that up until his capture he had not taken seriously the various stories of sea monsters, shamans and such, so from the time he came to on the beach until well into the next session he's assuming that he's dreaming or otherwise deluded.

With that said, I want to make sure I realistically represent my character's background and prejudices.  I'm poking around on Wikipedia as I write this, and I see that the English Civil War had only ended a couple generations before Edward was born, and he was one year old when William of Orange took the throne.  I don't know how any of this would have propagated to rural England, but my understanding is that Edward should see the Catholic Church as something England freed herself from.  As a loyal navy man, Edward would have gone along with whatever the state said, but now that he's disillusioned I expect he'll re-evaluate everything he ever believed.  On the other hand, I made him a Taurus, so he's probably not quick to change his world view either.
--------------------------- Crag stops pasting ----------------------------
Done @pasting.
Crag says, "So what I'm wondering is: what is Edward's faith and how does he feel about Catholics and especially Catholic priests."
Crag says, "While he did grow up working on a farm, it may be that his father fed him true or false tails of the outside world."
Crag says, "And his maternal grandparents might have another perspective"
Crag says, "They owned the farm, so they're at least rich enough to have owned land in the late 1600s"
Crag says, "But they weren't rich enough to hire people to work the farm for them either"
Crag says, "I don't know if that's realistic either"
Crag says, "Were there non-noble land owners?"
Crag says, "I think I should have done more research before game started :)"
Crag says, "I could see myself going to college to study history just so I could play RPGs better. :)"
Crag . o O ( or run them )
stormagnet says, "I'm not sure on those questions, to be honest"
stormagnet says, "I think it was possible to be granted land"
stormagnet says, "in exchange for military service and such"
Crag says, "Oh, that would make sense"
stormagnet says, "being poor and out in the boondocks, they would be equally likely to be Protestant or Catholic, I think"
stormagnet says, "but I think Protestant is a bit more likely"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "belief in sea monsters and such is absolutely validated, though"
stormagnet says, "but skepticism was sort of poking its head out around that time"
Crag says, "I think Edward is a skeptic"
stormagnet says, "but it was still in the very determined minority"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He's down-to-earth and the fantastic doesn't appeal to him"
stormagnet says, "but sailors of the time were extraordinarily superstitious"
Crag says, "That's true"
stormagnet says, "you could go both ways, I think"
Crag says, "good, that gives me some room :)"
stormagnet ,- not helpful :p
Crag laughs
Crag says, "No, you're very helpful"
stormagnet hugs!
Crag hugs :)
stormagnet says, "I'm all tired and fuzzy from the stupidity"
Crag says, "If I go to Greg he'll say 'do whatever you want' :)"
Crag says, "I have teh brain fog too"
stormagnet says, "but at least I got through it faster this time"
stormagnet heh
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Do they recognize you from your frequent visits yet?"
stormagnet says, "oooooh yes"
Crag heh
Crag says, "I think I'm going to say Edward's maternal grandfather earned their land with military duty"
Crag says, "Gramps could have given Ed military fever too which might explain his loyalty or whatever"
stormagnet says, "good choice :)"
Crag says, "He might even have taught him some things about fighting or something"
Crag says, "I think Ed doesn't much like his dad."
Crag says, "And I think maybe that's partly Grandfather's doing as well"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "nicely put together!"
Crag says, "Gramps sees Ed's dad as a cheating, lying good-for-nothing,"
stormagnet says, "the military aspect might help add to the skepticism, too"
Crag says, "Yes, that makes sense."
stormagnet sends you a pic as a reward ...
Crag says, "YAY!"
stormagnet just remembered :P
Crag says, "I didn't even know I was earning a reward :)"
stormagnet says, "I been very careless lately"
stormagnet says, "plus being teh sick made me all gross"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "It's a good picture :)"
Crag says, "You look like you need a hug though!"
Crag hugs lots!
stormagnet says, "aw!!"
stormagnet hugs!!!
stormagnet says, "I did"
stormagnet is so very tiredy and frazzled
Crag says, "If you need to nap or something you shouldn't stay up on my account."
Crag says, "I'm supposed to be sleeping off my sickness but I've already napped several hours"
stormagnet says, "I was on the verge of dropping into bed for a quick nap, but remembered to get on the laptop first to check in :)"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "I sure am glad you did"
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "Now I can write more of Ed's back story with more confidence"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm still not sure how to react to the priest though"
stormagnet says, "you can post it in scroll, and I will read it as soon as I get up!"
Crag says, "Of course"
stormagnet says, "as for the priest, I'd say he's rightly conflicted"
Crag says, "Out of game I don't _want_ to have a problem with the priest"
stormagnet says, "I don't think his background would be the type to make him outright hateful"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "He's too 'rational' for that"
stormagnet says, "and he would feel the need to be at least respectful towards a man of the cloth, I think"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Absolutel"
stormagnet says, "remember, not all types of Protestants are the same"
Crag says, "And I think Ed respects authority by default, even if they're on the other side"
stormagnet says, "you might want to poke at Wikipedia some more for that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I certainly will"
Crag says, "I think Ed may have a grudging respect for the priest"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "precisely :)"
stormagnet says, "especially if the priest is one of the poverty-vow types"
stormagnet says, "as opposed to the fat-and-powerful corrupt type"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet says, "which is what the Protestants were originally protesting :P"
Crag says, "We know this much about him"
Crag says, "He was on a Spanish merchant galeon"
Crag says, "He escaped the battle somehow"
Crag says, "And he's acting as though he's taken a vow of silence."
stormagnet says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "cautious, grudging respect dseems to be the name of the game"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and I don't think there'd be any reason to distrust him"
stormagnet says, "but Ed might find him somewhat.... distasteful?"
Crag says, "And I'll explain away my first reaction as still dazed from the obsurdities"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes, I think so"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet shrugs
Crag says, "I need to better figure out how to react to Shea's charachter too"
stormagnet says, "I leave it to you sir :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "James and Ben's are easy to get along with"
stormagnet says, "Shea's character is a heathen"
Crag says, "yeah, I was thinking that too"
stormagnet says, "but heathen's do as heathens will"
stormagnet says, "if your not the super evangelical type"
stormagnet says, "after all, you're likely more Country and Military than Church"
Crag says, "(I don't think I am)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah, that's the way I see it too"
Crag says, "Next session..."
Crag says, "will be weird"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "that's a given"
Crag says, "Shea is going to level up enough to control spiders"
Crag says, "And we're on an island whose inhabitants worship spiders"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "I suspect James may level up enough to do some crazier stuff too"
Crag says, "But all his will be hidden"
Crag says, "Shea's control of spiders will be undeniable to Ed"
Crag says, "poor Ed!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He's going to be so confused."
stormagnet says, "I think his years of sailing and fighting have pry disillusioned him enough to deal, tho"
Crag says, "I think he may decide to stop drinking because of all this :)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Well... maybe."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'm sure he's hardened"
Crag says, "This isn't Call of Cthulu afterall"
Crag says, "no san loss"
stormagnet says, "I'd take as the 'I'm already pry hellbound, anyway' type"
Crag says, "Who, ed?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "hm, yeah"
Crag says, "because of his part in the mutiny"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He betrayed the state to save his fellow sailors"
Crag says, "He would see that as unforgivable at first"
Crag says, "A weakness"
stormagnet says, "I'd say he's conflicted, certainly"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "he's 22, of course he's conflicted :)"
stormagnet says, "He's a Taurus, though"
stormagnet says, "so I'd say pragmitism is going to come before religion for him"
Crag says, "Absolutely"
Crag says, "I like the 'already fallen' thing you mentioned"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It would explain how he could succumb to greed"
stormagnet says, "a LOT of poor Protestants (and Catholics) have that mindset"
Crag says, "Which I think he will have a problem with"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "heee!"
Crag says, "I love talking about this stuff with you!"
stormagnet says, "he'll pry give some to the church"
stormagnet says, "and the poor"
Crag says, "Yes!  He'll try to buy forgiveness."
stormagnet says, "in an attempt to cleanse his conscience"
stormagnet says, "which is classic Catholic, too"
stormagnet says, "which is likely to make him a little more sympathetic"
stormagnet says, "so he'll be internally conflicted, but resigned"
Crag says, "James and Ben's characters are also hoping for some kind of redemption."
stormagnet says, "and waiting to see how this craziness plays out"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that could end up being a uniting theme"
Crag says, "Shea's motivations are not nearly as clear :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah, a uniting theme would be cool..."
Crag says, "The presence of the priest will be... complicating."
stormagnet says, "if Tetsuo is a Franciscan, rather than Dominican"
stormagnet says, "you guys might end up confiding in him"
Crag says, "Oh, I need to look that up :)"
stormagnet says, "but a Dominican would be more likely, I think"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "yeah, that's some craziness around that period You Should Know"
Crag says, "there's a lot I need to know"
Crag says, "I put the bar pretty high"
Crag says, "Regarding Ed's personality"
Crag says, "I think he's a bit less impulsive than Pollo or Dan"
Crag says, "I think he's more reserved"
Crag says, "Less cocky than Pollo, less ruthless than Dan"
Crag says, "But still completely comfortable beating the crap out of people"
Crag says, "Though, I think he's probably unwilling to kill a foe in cold blood"
Crag says, "He'd rather just knock someone out and sort it out later when everyone has calmed down."
Crag says, "And to that end I think he will avoid the use of weapons whenever possible"
Crag says, "Having read up on the system today, I now know this is relatively easy to do (not kill people) by not doing Killing damage"
Crag says, "Unarmed combat only does Shock damage"
Crag says, "And I took the 'With Style: Precise' trait for my pugilism, so I can always choose to hit someone in the head to knock them out as soon as possible."
Crag says, "If I've understood the rules correctly, Ed can knock out anyone who is not wearing head armor with at most two blows to the head."
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag says, "I'm also looking at buying the 'light touch' ability which allows me to choose not to kill people."
stormagnet says, "I think that works perfectly for his type"
Crag says, "Me too"
stormagnet says, "he's maybe not too bright"
stormagnet says, "but he knows it"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "so he just does the best he can"
Crag says, "That's a big part of it too"
Crag says, "I'm fond of the Not To Bright types"
stormagnet says, "by not doing anything Hasty or Reckless"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "and I think he'd be very against that in others, too"
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet says, "the Slow but Stolid type"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "You understand perfectly :)"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "oh, I know!"
stormagnet says, "Andre the Giant's character in Princess Bride"
stormagnet says, "kind of an extreme example, maybe"
stormagnet says, "but that sort"
Crag says, "Oh, I haven't seen that in a long time"
Crag says, "I need to see it again"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "There are a lot of characters like that"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's a well established archetype"
Crag says, "Usually they exagerate the dimmness and 'gentle giant' attributes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "you can be more deft"
Crag says, "Whereas I see Ed as at least smart enough to run a ship"
stormagnet says, "less exaggerated"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "you're not RETARDED"
Crag says, "right :)"
stormagnet says, "just not bright"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Currently my brain stat is the human average"
stormagnet says, "you may even be the type to regard being *too* clever as a flaw"
Crag says, "I intend to keep it there"
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "you think too much, boy *biff*"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "precisely!"
Crag says, "In this system a 2 in Brains is "you can get high grades with a lot of work""
Crag says, "And 3 is "you're notably bright and learning comes easily to you"
Crag says, "I think I'm going to lock down my brains at 2"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I can buy up my Sailor skill to compensate for my average brains"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "you're patient and thorough"
Crag says, "this is good!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet says, "and you don't overthink things"
Crag says, "Competence through dedication"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "absolutely believable"
stormagnet says, "very Everyman-ish"
Crag says, "And my super-human traits will all be physical"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Unrealistic strength, speed and all that"
stormagnet says, "but maybe not so quick to pick up on a joke"
stormagnet :)
Crag grins.
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that would be a good way to role-play the deficit"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "oh, I like that"
stormagnet says, "except it's not really a 'deficit' at all"
Crag says, "I don't have a gimmick yet"
stormagnet says, "but I'm guessing the other pry bought up on brains"
Crag says, "Well, compared to the rest it is :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Ben not so much"
stormagnet says, "that's a surprise"
Crag says, "But Shea and James for sure"
stormagnet says, "he's really branching out"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I haven't looked at his sheet :)"
stormagnet says, "there's usually one Witty type per party"
Crag says, "He's witty!"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "But he's not a professor"
stormagnet says, "so you two can play off eachother on that"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Possibly!"
Crag says, "Ohhhh"
Crag says, "I could revive the "I really don't know anything about that" as "I don't get it""
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "use both"
Crag says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet says, "or the pause pause awkward laugh"
Crag says, "OH!"
stormagnet says, "the 'ooooh... that was a joke.... I think....'"
Crag says, "He's also like Jame in firefly :)"
Crag says, "Jane I mean"
stormagnet says, "yeah!!"
stormagnet says, "but patient"
Crag says, "Was that a joke?!!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "ANd not quite so bloodthirsty"
stormagnet says, "not the angry type"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "right"
Crag says, "yay Ed!"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "You know I named him after Edward Elric, right?"
Crag says, "Even though he's more like Alphonse"
stormagnet says, "I thought that might be the case"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "heee"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "I need to nap"
Crag says, "alright"
Crag says, "I might be here when you wake up :)"
Crag hugs and snuggles :)
stormagnet says, "I look forward to your scroll :)"
stormagnet snuggles!!
stormagnet says, "I won;t be napping long"
stormagnet says, "as I have Other Things To Do"
Crag says, "you say that now..."
stormagnet says, "aheheheheheheh"
stormagnet says, "you know me well"
stormagnet says, "but really!"
Crag says, "it's true!"
stormagnet says, "I slept a TON yesterday and last night"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet is really really tired of being tired
stormagnet says, "ah, well"
Crag says, "science will rescue you ... someday!"
Crag says, "For now, enjoy your delicious nap"
stormagnet says, "I'm aiming for about an hour and a half :)"
Crag says, "I'll definitely be here then :)"
stormagnet idles: deeeeeeeeeliicious!
Crag reads up on catholocism
Crag says, "I think the mute priest may be a Carmelite, since Greg described his robes as all white"
Crag says, "But I doubt it would make any difference to our party"
Crag says, "If it's true, it would just indicate a greater focus on devotion to Mary."
Crag says, "Oh, there might be a tie-in to the crusades, which might be significant after all"
Crag says, "This priest may have some kind of tie in to the Knights Templar or something."
Crag . o O ( I didn't expect some sort of spanish inquisition! )
Crag says, "Apparently the Dominicans wore a black cloak, the Franciscans a grey cloak and the Carmelites a white cloak."
Crag says, "Just queued up bamboo blade 5 :)"

Total: 1 person, who has not been active recently.
Crag says, "GAH!  Why does every anime have a hot spring episode?!"
Crag says, "Not that I mind the service, obviously"
Crag says, "Just... have some origonality or something?"
Crag says, "Originality"
Crag says, "whatever"
stormagnet says, "ee["
Crag heh
stormagnet, predictably enough, slept way longer than she intended >_<
Crag says, "I was beginning to wonder :)"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet sweatdrops
Crag grins.
stormagnet would love to watch something though!
Crag says, "Alright"
stormagnet says, "while you're still awake :)"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "I can do my homework later ^_^;"
Crag says, "I almost went to sleep a while ago"
stormagnet . o O ( why am I so sleepy? )
Crag says, "I was sitting in bed with the laptop trying to decide what to do with the XP from last session"
stormagnet is frustrated by this
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "how are you feeling?"
Crag says, "The snag in my throat seems to be gone"
Crag says, "I don't have recent poop to judge"
stormagnet says, ":nods"
stormagnet says, "that sounds like progress, despite my mav"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "Yesterday and this morning my poo was insufficiently firm"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "My mood is not as high as it was last week"
Crag says, "But it's higher than it was at work this morning"
Crag says, "this is probably the lowest-grade sickness ever, but it feels like more to me right now"
stormagnet says, "up for baccano?"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "Episode 10, right?"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Are you ready for the signal?"
stormagnet says, "not just yet"
Crag says, "Ok, let me know :)"
stormagnet finally broke down and bought a way-too-expensive apple, and had to go slice it
stormagnet says, "they were killing me!"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "deeeelicuuus"
stormagnet says, "the apple eating chick in Claymore, the fruit bowl, the unclassy apple eating gangster"
stormagnet says, "I'm ready now, tho"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "Here comes the signal..."
Crag | START
Crag says, "All good?"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Whew!"
stormagnet had a mouf full of apple
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I still haven't looked up that Sin City actor!"
stormagnet 1:00
stormagnet says, "hee"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if it's gonna come back at those thugs that they don't know the name rule"
Crag says, "Sounds likely"
Crag says, "There's a Sin City 2 listed on imdb.com to come out in 2009"
stormagnet says, "but at least Dallas ought to be able to protect his sister adequatly now"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "so it was him"
Crag says, "Which one is he?"
Crag says, "I can't keep them all straight :)"
stormagnet says, "the one who was chatting with the demon"
stormagnet says, "AH"
stormagnet says, "that explains the resemblance"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "and I knew she couldn't be too bad"
Crag says, "damn :)"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "teh hawt"
Crag says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "the voice switch is hilarious"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet LAUGFHS
stormagnet knew it
stormagnet says, "they didn't even check the knot"
Crag says, "I'm pretty confused.  I might have to watch this series like ... five times?"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "wow"
Crag says, "Who could say no to her?"
stormagnet says, "Eve is hard core"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet hopes they run into eachother again
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "YOU ALREADY DID"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
stormagnet says, "LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "that's not half bad"
stormagnet says, "but still dumb"
stormagnet says, "!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "EXCELLENT"
stormagnet says, "AND DRINK IT"
stormagnet says, "we want people like them immortal"
Crag blinks
Crag says, "clearly"
Crag says, "wtf"
Crag says, "he's such a loon!"
stormagnet says, "I can't believe they aren't already"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "AWESOME!"
stormagnet says, "which means they pull heists like that without any guarantee of safety"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "they can't help it!"
stormagnet says, "following the rule"
Crag says, "ah, that makes more sense"
stormagnet says, "!!"
stormagnet says, "I thought there would be a crazy punishment if they violated it"
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet says, "that girl has either incredible stones, or is just unbelievably pure"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "oh my"
stormagnet says, "he's a coward"
stormagnet loses
Crag says, "So... Ladd isn't importal either?"
stormagnet says, "daaaang"
stormagnet says, "evidentally"
Crag says, "holy crap"
stormagnet dittos
Crag drools
stormagnet says, "I'm guessing she is"
stormagnet says, "dumbass"
Crag says, "We may soon find out"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag says, "I wonder if importality is passed on to children"
stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "poor Chane!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "ah, that answers that"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "there are wholes and halves"
Crag says, "I love you, Chane!"
stormagnet nods!!
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "that guy is way too psycho"
Crag says, "AWESOME!"
Crag says, "I guess it's not a shotgun"

stormagnet says, "AHAH"
Crag says, "Ahh, it all becomes clear"
stormagnet says, "but they're nice people, who worry about that sort of thing"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I have almost no concept of the various plot lines :)"
stormagnet says, "the waitress was awes, too"
Crag says, "But I'm loving the mood"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "I'm sure they'll get on famously"
Crag says, "I hope so"
stormagnet says, "I have found one store in this area that is reliably NOT sold out of chocolate cornet when I go looking"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet ate said cornet just now
stormagnet tried the dipping trick
stormagnet says, "it worked nicely :)"
stormagnet says, "?"
Crag says, "I'm looking at the Sin City cast now"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "brb"
stormagnet potties
Crag nods
Crag says, "Heh, Frank Miller had a part in the movie :)"
Crag says, "Maybe that wasn't the film I'm thinking of.  Damn."
stormagnet shrugs
stormagnet says, "I remember the character that looked like the dude"
stormagnet says, "I think he was some crooked politician"
stormagnet says, "but meh"
stormagnet says, "11?"
Crag says, "That would be the actor who was Ty in Deadwood"
Crag says, "I was thinking of someone older and fatter"
Crag says, "But maybe I'm merging characters"
stormagnet says, "I was remembering him older and fatter..."
Crag says, "Or maybe I'm failing my imdb.com dice roll"
stormagnet shrugs
Crag says, "I'll look again after 11 :)"

stormagnet says, "hmph"

stormagnet says, "in addition to them having school"
Crag says, "The last episode didn't come out very long ago"
stormagnet forgives
Crag checks their schedule
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "It must take serious stone to resist those cliffhangers in the face of school, though"
stormagnet certainly can't
Crag says, "They released 4 in august, 2 in sep, 4 in oct and one on the 3rd of nov"

stormagnet idles: campus
stormagnet idles: sounds like a porn site
stormagnet returns
stormagnet says, "so, I broke down and bought an accent dictionary at the student bookstore"
stormagnet says, "after fruitlessly inquiring about discount airfares"
stormagnet says, "(which were either booked solid or MORE expensive than the deals I'd already found)"
stormagnet says, "and I meant to use my 30% student discount"
stormagnet says, "EXCEPT"
stormagnet says, "apparantly, in an amazing display of extremely Japanese Pointless Bureaucracy"
stormagnet says, "it is not enough to, oh, SHOW STUDENT ID"
stormagnet says, "ooooooh, no"
stormagnet says, "No"
stormagnet says, "You have to go to a DIFFERENT counter"
stormagnet says, "and fill out an application"
stormagnet says, "to receive a different card"
stormagnet says, "in addition to your student ID"
stormagnet says, "and this requires"
stormagnet gives a drumroll
stormagnet says, "a DEPOSIT"
stormagnet says, "of 10000Y"
stormagnet says, "IN CASH ONLY"
stormagnet says, "not only am I not remotely in the habit of *carrying* that much scratch"
stormagnet says, "but I am absolutely BAFFLED as to what the possible purpose could be"
stormagnet says, "it's not a FEE mind you"
stormagnet says, "the deposit is returned when you either graduate or unenroll"
stormagnet says, "W."
stormagnet says, "T."
stormagnet says, "F."
stormagnet says, "auuuiiiiigh"
stormagnet says, "anyway, at least they stamped my receipt"
stormagnet says, "(yes, with it's own special little stamp!)"
stormagnet says, "to verify that I *intend* to sign up for this discount"
stormagnet says, "so that when I come back later and give them their $@%#@$@!! deposit"
stormagnet says, "I can get the 30% discount on that dictionary refunded"
stormagnet steams
stormagnet would not freaking bother if this sort of reference book weren't SO impossible to find in the US

Crag says, "Heh"
Crag says, "I made an appointment for Thursday morning to meet a technical recruiter in person to look at unix jobs."
Crag says, "hee hee hee"
Crag says, "There's another series you'll like called Mokke"
Crag says, "It's not funny or sexy, just kindof sweet"
Crag says, "They're clearly influenced by Miazaki"
Crag says, "But it's too slow for me to watch by myself"
Crag says, "I'll watch it with you if we run out of things to watch together"
Crag says, "I'm putting what I have in for-stormy for you to check out"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "net in my apartment stopped working"
stormagnet says, "AGAIN"
Crag says, "OH HAI"
Crag says, "stupid apartment net!"
Crag says, "Just got off the phone with TIff"
Crag says, "Looks like we're going to get together tomorrow night to do something or other"
Crag says, "She sounded promisingly flirty."
Crag says, "But who knows."
Crag says, "I have teh brain fog"
Crag says, "So are you online from school or did your net resume working?"
Crag says, "Whatever god is responsible for connectivity in Tokyo is holding my stormy hostage!"
Crag says, "This will not stand!"
Crag says, "The dude will not stand!"
Crag says, "I will... uh... whine about it?"
Crag says, "There's something abotu mixing technology with mythology that appeals to me"
Crag says, "I bet there's something about the way brains work where they want to personify everything"
Crag says, "'give it a name', as they used to say in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead."
Crag says, "It's like the first step is naming things"
Crag says, "ANd the second step is giving them personalities"
Crag says, "And with that comes motive and benevolence or malevolence"
Crag says, "And then comes powers with limits of some kind"
Crag says, "I think this is how brains work"
Crag says, "First we think it's just us, then we think it's us and them."
Crag says, "And after that we try to figure out who They are no matter what It is."
Crag says, "I think this goes deeper than applying patterns universally"
Crag says, "which would be my first guess"
Crag says, "My first guess would be that as we see patterns we test those patterns against later stimuli and try to make a match"
Crag says, "But I think this goes deeper"
Crag says, "I think that's a higher level function than what I'm thinking of now"
Crag says, "So I guess what I'm saying is that projecting a modeled will or "personality" onto inputs is a lower function than a more general model projection."
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "Because it's a copy of our own self understanding"
Crag says, "We have thoughts and feelings and it's more natural to project THAT onto things that to project mechanical rules on things."
Crag says, "But I am biased towards things which I believe are more "logical""
Crag says, "Or maybe I should say I'd like to think that's my bias"
Crag says, "I wonder why that is"
Crag says, "wow, I'm having a wine covnersation by myself"
Crag says, "and yes, I have the requisite wine on hand."
Crag says, "It doesn't seem to have hurt my typing any"
Crag resumes ponderin
stormagnet says, "I'm online in class"
stormagnet says, "ergo the afk-y-ness"
Crag says, "You're alive!"
Crag says, "I'm a little tipsy :)"
stormagnet says, "that's what I call the narrative in my usual rant that you're talking about, thar"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet :)
Crag grins.
Crag says, "I hadn't thought of it in terms of projection before"
stormagnet says, "yay wine conversation"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "and we're logging it!"
Crag says, "totally!"
stormagnet says, "win!"
stormagnet has to do class stuff now
Crag says, "I need to backup these awesome logs"
Crag says, "damn"
Crag says, "I will continue generating scroll for a while :)"
stormagnet says, "good!"
Crag says, "I'm watching the first episode of a series with a lot of .. strange service."
Crag says, "Not... kinky, mind you"
stormagnet says, "nice!"
stormagnet looks forward to watching it later
Crag says, "just muted with melancholy or something"
Crag says, "So there's clothed large boobs and tears."
Crag says, "It's ... arty"
stormagnet says, "sad girlks in the sniw?"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
Crag says, "kinda"
Crag says, "sad girls in the blossoms"
stormagnet can't type well without looking
Crag says, "I knew what you meant :)"
stormagnet says, "you can use those two interchangably in Japanese symbolic tradition, anyway"
Crag says, "That figures"
Crag says, "SO MUCH BOOB"
stormagnet says, "ummm"
Crag says, "2/3 of the screen!"
stormagnet says, "this is becominbg non-classfirstrow safe"
Crag says, "But it's in a sweater!"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "sorry"
Crag says, "^L, I'll stop typing that kind of stuff :)"
Crag says, "Oh great, there's a violin player too"
Crag says, "what is it with violinists?!"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
stormagnet looks forward to it
stormagnet says, "I have to reorder that kanji dictionary for the DS"
Crag says, "This is definitely something for you"
stormagnet says, "it sold out :("
Crag says, "yes!"
Crag says, "You must!"
stormagnet is very, very tempted to throw some games and manga in the cart with it
Crag says, "Go for it!"
Crag says, "Live it up!"
Crag says, "You have earned it!"
Crag says, "Woah"
stormagnet says, "which is TOTALLY unjustifiable, because I already have free shipping"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "This show suddenly got very un subtle"
stormagnet says, "oh my"
Crag says, "I had to puase it :)"
Crag says, "I think maybe somebody is dreaming."
Crag says, "I will have to re-watch this whole episode"
Crag says, "It's disjointed like an OVA"
Crag says, "But it claims to be an ep01"
Crag . o O ( what has she done to me )
Crag . o O ( when did I start talking like this )
Crag says, "But yeah, you should go nuts with the DS stuff"
Crag says, "I canceled the insurance today, so that's another big bill we aren't paying"
Crag says, "We're down to rent, food, net, colo, storage, phone and utilities"
Crag says, "And unless my math is off, that's less than $2k a month"
Crag says, "So we're saving about $2400 a month minus your expenses"
Crag says, "So yes, please help yourself to some DS treats!"
Crag unpuases now
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag hee
Crag says, "I was at the end of the episode"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "The dramatic... unsubtlty was a cliffhanger"
stormagnet says, "I'm at a point in class where I can slack a little :)"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "I still haven't gotten a letter about my level 2 status thing"
Crag says, "level 2 status?"
stormagnet says, "so I might not have been approved"
Crag says, "Are you going for another jump up in your japanese class?"
stormagnet doesn't know if they bother notifying you if you're rejected
stormagnet says, "not that, the disability thing"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "so my medicine might continue to be $200 a month :("
Crag says, "That's ok!"
stormagnet needs to start forwarding insurance bills around O_o
Crag says, "We're saving over $300 a month from me not driving"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "that's excellent"
stormagnet says, "you're doing awesome on the budget ^_^"
Crag says, "Seriously, we are doing great"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "It's not really anything I'm doing"
Crag says, "I'm just not spending money over here :)"
stormagnet says, "you're paring down"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I eat, I go to work, that's it :)"
stormagnet says, "that's admirable!"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "well shucks"
stormagnet says, "and hang out!"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "lots of hangouts!"
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "$50 a week for hangouts"
stormagnet says, "you're doing good on the social life front too"
Crag says, "That's true"
stormagnet says, "you've really got it together"
Crag says, "aw!"
Crag says, "I... guess so!"
Crag says, "You're right!"
Crag says, "I thought I'd try to get up early tomorrow to go to REI before work"
Crag says, "And then walk to work in new shoes"
stormagnet gives Crag an xp for 'got it together'.
Crag says, "I deposited your grandparents' check today"

stormagnet has to file in advance for Permission for Re-entry
Crag says, "permission for re-entry?"
Crag says, "That sounds kinda hot..."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "Do I need to fill anything out too?"
stormagnet says, "new procedures, too"
Crag says, "woah, new procedures?!"
Crag says, "I haven't been reading those stories!"
stormagnet says, "so when I come back in, I have to get fingerprinted and photographed and interrogated and crap"
Crag says, "I'm not into scat"
stormagnet says, "because Bush Is A Dick, and His Politics Are An STD"
Crag says, "Interrogation could be fun though"

stormagnet says, "it's a real relief to know the budget is in such good shape, though"
Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "We're doin' great"
Crag says, "But you should still tutor!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think you will like it"
stormagnet says, "I still want to"
stormagnet says, "but it's nice to know that if I get sick or too tired, that it won't impact the budget too badly"
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "I'm quite proud, if I do say so myself"
stormagnet says, "and I'd been waiting to go submit my paperwork until the disability stuff arrived, so I could do it all in one shot"
stormagnet says, "but I should stop waiting"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "if it's not here next Tuesday, I"m going without it"

Crag heh
stormagnet . o O ( he best not have delayed because of my bra )
Crag says, "They don't have a camera big enough to document these babies."
stormagnet . o O ( ..... )
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "He said he delayed because he was waiting to get his next paycheck.  I believe he has sent the package, but I will check with him again."
Crag says, "dammit"
Crag says, "I should have held the car ransom!"
Crag says, "He got the car smogged already"
Crag says, "I mean, it's good that he got it taken care of"
Crag says, "But I thought he'd change the ownership first"
stormagnet says, "we shoulds film you petting the cats and then speed the film up"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag laughs!
Crag says, "That would be funny :)"

stormagnet says, "wtf, Ty?!"
Crag back
Crag says, "I guess he couldn't afford to send i?"
Crag says, "it"
Crag says, "I told him he could have gotten money from me if that was the case"
Crag says, "But he didn't respond to that"
Crag says, "But this was a week ago"
Crag says, "So... whatever"
Crag says, "I'm way too trusting"
Crag says, "I just can't stop"
Crag says, "I want to believe people are a certain way"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if he lost it"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "That wouldn't make sense"
stormagnet says, "please go kick his ass for me"
Crag says, "It's more likely he's just a slacker"
stormagnet says, "ooooh, yes it would"
Crag says, "I will."
stormagnet says, "the bag with the stuff he's supposed to send me"
Crag says, "I could call him right now"
stormagnet says, "he might have misplaced"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think I will do that"
stormagnet says, "besides, if it hasn't shipped yet, there are a couple things I'd like to add to it"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "It went straight to VM"
stormagnet says, "......"
Crag says, "So he was either on the phone or had bad reception"
Crag says, "He picked up right away earlier tonight"
stormagnet KICKS TY'S ASS VIA CYBERNETS
Crag says, "So he'll prolly call me back in a bit"
stormagnet hopes so
Crag says, "Remember, I can revoke his VW privileges whenever I want"
Crag says, "I still have some authority"
stormagnet says, "could you please remind him that there are things in there that are Medically Neccessary"
Crag says, "I will."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He tries to seem like he means well, so I'm sure he'll do the right thing to support that illusion"
Crag says, "I really don't know what to think of him"
Crag says, "He's been really cool lately, but he's also still Very Wrong All The Time."
Crag says, "I've been teasing him terribly because it's fun."
Crag says, "But..."
Crag says, "I dunno."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I've been thinking of him really well too lately"
stormagnet says, "er, really well of him"
stormagnet says, "so I'm startled that he would drop the ball on something this important"
stormagnet says, "I recommend just getting it back from him ASAP"
stormagnet says, "and sending it yourself"
stormagnet says, "since, like I said, there's some stuff I'd like to add"
stormagnet says, "medicine, for instance"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'll take care of it as soon as he calls me back"
Crag says, "And now I can get those labels from Ben"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Your grandmother showed them too me - pretty cool"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I didn't take any because your mom had said Ben had some for me"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "and I could tell you the address again any time :)"
Crag says, "I have it in email"
Crag says, "But the labels are just cool"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I want to learn kanji"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I can start teaching you some"
Crag says, "Not yet!"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "But yes"
Crag says, "I have the bug"
stormagnet says, "when I get back I can help keep myself sharp by teaching you :)"
Crag says, "the Japanese bug"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "I BLAME YOU!"
Crag says, "You did this to me!"
stormagnet accepts the blame :P
Crag says, "yay :)"
Crag says, "It's the gift that keeps giving"
Crag says, "I still like French better, though"
stormagnet says, "hey, I was pretty upfront about what you were getting into right from the start"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "That's true."
Crag says, "You never mis-represented yourself."
stormagnet says, "I've been going easy on you :P"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that's true too"
Crag says, "But I really do want to learn now"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "I mean, I'm watching anime by myself!"
Crag says, "That's the gateway art!"
stormagnet says, "there will be some Serious Geeking Out when I get back"
Crag says, "hell yeah"
Crag says, "And maybe I'll have a job that's less soul-sucking"
stormagnet flashes the born-rims
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "horn"
stormagnet says, "dammit"
stormagnet says, "that typo ruined everything!"
Crag says, "Not exactly!"
Crag says, "I thought you were talking about rims on a car... it made sense in my mind"
stormagnet says, "I honestly kind of doubt that you will find a job better than what you have no"
stormagnet says, "now"
Crag says, "Well..."
stormagnet says, "but it's worth looking!"
Crag says, "I can certainly make more money and do less Window"
Crag says, "s"
stormagnet says, "just that the benefits and co-worker relations and all that are so good"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Whether I can find co-workers and a boss this cool is another thing"
stormagnet says, "and there's also the insurance issue"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "I *think* that having continuous coverage gets me out of the 'pre-existing' loophole"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I assure you I won't make any decisions without checking with you"
Crag says, "I think you're right"
stormagnet says, "but it would be very bad to find out too late if it doesn't"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But if a company Really Wants Me, they could probably work something out too"
Crag says, "And hell, I am quite a catch!"
Crag grins
Crag says, "The headhunter indicated that she had a lot of positions she thinks I'd be good in"
Crag says, "woah, that sounds dirty"
Crag says, "I like it"
stormagnet says, "eep"
Crag unce, unce, unce
stormagnet says, "gotta go, class over, log on later"
Crag says, "ok!"
Crag watches stuff
Crag says, "the mplayer engine performs way better than the gstreamer engine"
Crag says, "OMG, awesome series!"
Crag says, "We have to watch Yoshimune together!"
Crag says, "So good!"
Crag says, "so funny!"
Crag puts what he has in for-stormy, toot-suite! (sp?)
Crag . o O ( tout? )
Crag says, "crap, the prospects for this series are bleak.  The subbers released 2 episodes in March, one in April, one in June and one in November."
Crag says, "There are 19 more to go!"
Crag says, "It might be time for me to dive into the depths of irc to cajole subbers."
Crag says, "oh god, the anachronisms in this one are the best!"
Crag says, "I have to watch one more episode... just to be sure..."
Crag says, "OK"
Crag says, "We'll just put that in for-stormy then..."
Crag says, "Only watch the first two episodes of Yoshimune!"
Crag says, "It will be hard to stop"

stormagnet says, "(sure took them awhile)"
stormagnet says, "what's your dad's middle name again?"
stormagnet says, "I remember it starts with an A, but isn't Andrew"
stormagnet says, "but I don;t want to just randomly try stuff, because that'll likely make things worse"
stormagnet says, "dammit, you really did go to bed hella early"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "man, I *knew* this was going to happen, too"
stormagnet could you call them tomorrow or something?
stormagnet reverse mavs?

stormagnet pokes!
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet says, "you woke up while I was in the shower :("
stormagnet says, "your guess was wrong, but since you woke up special, I'll give you a hint:"
stormagnet says, "it begins with a B"
stormagnet says, "and ends in accano!"
stormagnet says, "but in order to buy it, I need CapitalOne to let me use the card-"
stormagnet says, "or pay a $@%##@! fee for using the BofA"
stormagnet says, "it turns out both the dictionary AND the lap blanket orders got cancelled due to CapitalOne blocking the card :("
stormagnet says, "so I might just be impatient enough to pay the stupid fee"
stormagnet tries to be patient, tho
stormagnet says, "ok, I take it back"
stormagnet says, "you should watch Clannad too"
stormagnet says, "because there is a running character gag thing that has me laughing my ass off"
stormagnet says, "the rest of the series doesn't really have all that much going for it"
stormagnet says, "but that may just stand to hilight that joke more, and makle it funnier each time, or something"
stormagnet says, "it's not really a joke, per say"
stormagnet says, "it's just that the main charachter dead pan pranks beautifully"
stormagnet says, "like, I have to try some of these"
stormagnet says, "and those twins are a LOT like the Lucky Star girls"
stormagnet says, "so it's kind of like getting an extra chapter, or something"

Crag says, "I guess you need your sleep too"
Crag says, "I'm paying the capone down to 900"
Crag says, "actually, I wonder if I should just pay it all off"
Crag says, "We have the money, so not paying it off is just costing us interest"
Crag says, "Yeah, I'm going to do it."
Crag says, "I get paid tonight anyway"
stormagnet is awake!
Crag says, "YAY!"
stormagnet shouldn't be, but is!
Crag says, "And I was just about to go afk to go potty!"

stormagnet says, "I'm glad I stayed up too late"
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "me too!"

stormagnet hugs!!!!
Crag returns hugs with happy sigh :)
stormagnet says, "hee!"
Crag says, "CapOne's site is slow"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "they just redesigned it"
stormagnet says, "so it was down for awhile"
Crag says, "Oh, the slowness is probably related"
Crag says, "They're running on ASP!"
Crag says, "idiots"
stormagnet says, "and earlier, I tried with Firefox, and got redirected to an error"
stormagnet says, "but got through with IE"
stormagnet says, "yeah, exactly"
Crag says, "I'm using firefox on linux and it's working ok for now"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "But damn"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "they must have fixed it ^_^"
Crag says, "Why would anyone run a MONEY site on WINDOWS"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "which shows they at least take compatibility seriously, despite their poor choice"
Crag says, "I'll call them after you go to sleep :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "I should go to bed right away"
Crag says, "Aw"
stormagnet was just finishing up the Clannad she'ds downloaded ^_^;
Crag says, "I see"
stormagnet says, "and you have to pee, too, right?"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "yeah but... stormeh"
stormagnet says, "I'm WAY past my bedtime"
Crag says, "I won't be online much tonight"
stormagnet says, "I watched *just one* thinking, well this show is slow, I can get away with watching just one before bed...."
Crag says, "I have bowling until 6 and then Tiff and I will be watching anime I guess"
stormagnet says, "and suddenly the storyline picked up >_<"
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
Crag says, "heh"

Crag peers at the cats suspiciously
Crag says, "I might"

stormagnet says, "and the cats are much more polite when you sleep during the day ^_^;"
Crag says, "that's freaking true"
stormagnet says, "they encopurage it, in fact..."
Crag says, "cats!"
stormagnet laughs
Crag makes faces! (and tries not to laugh)
stormagnet wants to have cats in her bed
stormagnet . o O ( why does this apartment not come with a cat? )
Crag says, "hee"
stormagnet calls the landlord to protest
Crag says, "that would be funny"
stormagnet says to the landlord, "Hello? What's the deal? There's no cat in this bed!"
Crag says, "We'll fix that right away, ma'am"
Crag says, "Clearly an oversight"
the landlord replies to stormagnet, " Oh my goodness, it must be out of order. We'll send a fresh one right up!"
Crag laughs
stormagnet loses!
stormagnet laughs
Crag plays with stormy!
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "That would be a good story element :)"
stormagnet says, "when you sleep during the day, Sancho will curl up with you"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "He does that at night to"
Crag says, "Marco too"
Crag says, "In fact"
stormagnet says, "and if you try to get up, he will make the sleepy cat mreh! sound"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "When I went to sleep the first time last night, Marco was under my arm where you would normally be"
stormagnet says, "bookends"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that is why he is the teddy cat!"
Crag says, "it's true!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "ok, that just made me even sleepier"
Crag says, "And just so I have my story straight"
Crag says, "When I call CapOne"
stormagnet says, "I have got to go to bed"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "You were just trying to use the card online, right?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh, you don't even have it in person yet, so duh"
Crag says, "stupid Robert"
stormagnet says, "but I would like to use it in person, too, if possible"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I know"
Crag says, "Crap, I don't have it myself now"
Crag says, "that's... going to complicate things"
stormagnet says, "I think you can call and tell them"
Crag says, "Well yeah"
stormagnet says, "that I want to use it"
stormagnet says, "you're on the phone"
Crag says, "true"
stormagnet says, "so the card info you give them is enough"
Crag says, "I wonder if I could get them to send you one."
stormagnet says, "and the contact info is on the site"
stormagnet says, "they might!"
Crag says, "I'll ask."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!!!
stormagnet says, "thank you"

stormagnet says, "I think that trick was used on us"
stormagnet says, "several parts of it seemed familiar"
stormagnet is so so glad to be out and away from mortgages forever and ever
stormagnet says, "especially the deviation between what I remember being told and what I remember reading before the signing"
stormagnet says, "and what we actually got"
stormagnet missed the settlement deadline, though, as she never heard about it. dammit.
stormagnet says, "more junk paste:"
stormagnet says, "(from a news article on a conservative vanity publisher dicking over its writers""
stormagnet | Mr. Miniter said that meant that although he received about $4.25 a copy when his books sold in a bookstore or through an online retailer, he only earned about 10 cents a copy when his books sold through the Conservative Book Club or other Eagle-owned channels. .The difference between 10 cents and $4.25 is pretty large when you multiply it by 20,000 to 30,000 books,. Mr. Miniter said. .It suddenly occurred to us that Regnery is making collectively jillions of dollars off of us and paying us a pittance.. He added: .Why is Regnery acting like a Marxist cartoon of a capitalist company?.
stormagnet says, "HINT"
stormagnet says, "IT IS A CAPITALIST COMPANY"
stormagnet says, "RUN BY CONSERVATIVES"
stormagnet says, "they really, really can't handle getting dished what they preach"

stormagnet says, "In the first episode of Mokke, there's a mistranslation- a pretty big one"
stormagnet says, "I suspect that the translator was a little unfamiliar with English idioms"
stormagnet says, "What the translated as 'overlook' (mikosu) is actually 'forsee, anticipate'"
stormagnet says, "To overlook is (minokosu)"
stormagnet says, "It doesn't make any sense the way they translated it- he tells her to overlook it and then to look at it"
stormagnet says, "aheh"
stormagnet says, "also, I doubt this makes much of a difference"
stormagnet says, "but 'look them in the eye' is actually 'face them'"
stormagnet says, "no body parts are involved in the Japanese word"
stormagnet says, "it's literally 'turn towards and look'"
stormagnet says, "also, he says "if you're too scared the learn this, you won't be able to protect mizuki *or even yourself*"
stormagnet says, "...kittah!!"
stormagnet says, "also, I am deeply amused that the Accuweather forcast for Tokyo for next Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 'Sunny, Sunshine, *Brilliant* sunshine"
stormagnet says, "ah- I see"
stormagnet says, "they were translating it as 'overlook' so that that part would make sense later"
stormagnet says, "the 'over' in this case is 'cross over, overcome'"
stormagnet says, "like, for mountains"
stormagnet says, "so it's a kind of kanji pun"
stormagnet says, "got my ticket!"

stormagnet says, "I wasn't able to find anything much cheaper, but it'll due :)"
stormagnet says, "er, do"
stormagnet . o O ( freudian slip! )
stormagnet was worried about getting a ticket in time, since the cheap flights were filling up fast ^_^;
stormagnet says, "there's no way I would have made it in time without Grandma & Grandpa helping out :)"
stormagnet says, "please let them know that, and how much I'm looking forward to seeing them!"
stormagnet says, "my ticket took a little longer to process, too, because at first they booked it with me returning on the 30th *Seattle* time (even though my departure location was Tokyo!)"
stormagnet says, "which would have made me too late to go down to Osaka to enjoy the New Years festivities"
stormagnet says, "which would be LAME"
stormagnet says, "I still haven't figured out if I'm going to go down for Thanksgiving"
stormagnet says, "Shinkansen is pretty expensive, and I haven't gotten that disability discount thing that would make it 50% :("
Crag says, "Mokke makes a lot more sense with your insight"
Crag says, "YAY TICKET"
Crag says, "I think I'm spending Thanksgiving at your mom's"
stormagnet says, "you'd better!"
stormagnet says, "we had a plan!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Oh yeah!"
Crag says, "I forgot about the plan!"
stormagnet says, "besides, the food will be better :P"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "yay plan!"
stormagnet says, "Shinkansen to Osaka is (if I'm reading this right) 13750Y for a one way ticket"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "How far is it?"
stormagnet says, "552.6k"
Crag says, "Oh, that's pretty far :)"
stormagnet says, "the other usual method is to take a plane"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "8 km per 5 m..."
Crag says, "345 miles"
Crag says, "That's like from Seattle to Portland"
Crag says, "On a really fast modern train!"
Crag says, "ZOOM!"
Crag says, "Or more like WHOOSH"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "yeah, it sounds fun!"
stormagnet says, "but expensive :/"
stormagnet says, "otherwise I'd have gone already ^_^;"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "the fastest Shinkansen travels 168mph"
stormagnet says, "but that one's more expensive, so I won't be taking it ^_^;"
Crag nods
stormagnet says, "this site says the cheap seats (what I was looking at) take about 3hrs from ATokyo station to Shin-Osaka station"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "the cool thing is that there's a train every 15 minutes"
Crag says, "That doesn't seem any faster than taking the train from Seattle to Portland"
Crag says, "Oh!"
stormagnet says, "so I don't have to book anything"
Crag says, "That is cool!"
stormagnet says, "I just show up"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Yay Japan!"
stormagnet says, "though, given the chair, I think I'll try to make *some* arrangements in advance"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but I hear the Shinkansen is very wc bfriendly"
stormagnet says, "I'm still hoping to go for New Year's, tho"
stormagnet says, "and THAT I'll need to reserve in advance :/"
stormagnet says, "that's a hella Peak season"
Crag says, "I bet"
stormagnet says, "what do you reckon, budget wise?"
stormagnet says, "should I hold out for just New Years?"
Crag says, "hrm"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "We don't know what expenses might come up because of your visit"
stormagnet says, "Yeah, I thought so too, really"
stormagnet says, "I had thought I'd be tutoring by now and able to save up for the ticket"
stormagnet says, "and I'm able to come hom for Xmas, which is huge :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I still haven't bought any new clothes, christmas presents, computer hardware, or... anything else."
Crag says, "Oh, bowling was fun yesterday."
Crag says, "My third game of four I bowled 162"
Crag says, "The other three games were pretty weak"
Crag says, "I shocked everyone by drinking a carbomb."
Crag says, "Dave Walters (Jennifer's boss) was there too.  He's fun to hang out with. :)"
stormagnet says, "nice!!"
Crag says, "The recruiter I'm meeting this morning works for iMatch.com"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "that's... appropriate?"
Crag says, "I guess :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Tiff's in a difficult position job-wise"
Crag says, "She's had three jobs, all a month long"
Crag says, "and she just turned 23"
Crag says, "She's thinking she might have to go back to one of those jobs and see they'll take her back."
stormagnet says, "eeeep"
stormagnet says, "that's pretty weak"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "what happened?"
stormagnet says, "I forget, is she a contracter?"
Crag says, "The first job was seasonal and overstaffed"
stormagnet says, "weeeeeak"
Crag says, "The second one she left for personal reasons (this is the one she might go back to)"
Crag says, "The third was that magazine selling thing you tried for a while"
stormagnet says, "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that is some bottom of the barrel shit right there"
Crag says, "Oh, the second one was a Starbucks Kiosk"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that's at least pretty steady bottom-of0the-barelling, if you can get it"
stormagnet says, "and Not Be John"
Crag says, "I foget what she studied in college"
Crag says, "But she didn't finish that either"
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet says, "rough times"
Crag says, "so on paper she's looking REALLY grim"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I should know"
stormagnet says, "she could try Joanne's, for that matter"
Crag says, "And she admitted last night that she and Eric had only been together three months"
stormagnet says, "they're basically Always Hiring"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I should tell her about Joanne's"
Crag says, "She's in Shoreline, so that would be good for her"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's a grim place, and the turnover is rapid, but she'd have a good shot"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "She'd just have to suck it up"
stormagnet says, "it could hold her over until she finds someplace better"
Crag says, "And she might even have a shot at a 'managerial' role"
stormagnet says, "though I found out the hard way Not To Use Them As A Reference"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Which would help her resume a lot"
Crag heh
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "oh!"
stormagnet says, "a quick good news"
Crag says, "yay good news!"
stormagnet says, "look whqat I found, while poking around about travel plans"
Crag says, "and then I should head out :)"
stormagnet + http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/OsakaDowntownHostel-Osaka-6518
Crag peers
stormagnet should go to be4d, too
stormagnet says, "I dion't see it mentioned on that page, but the price is the same as that hostel in Shinjuku"
Crag says, "Cool"
stormagnet says, "approx. $25 a night"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Wow!"
Crag says, "Why is airport pickup $150?"
Crag | Airport pick up services are also available upon request at a price 40% lower than the normal price. Pick up service available from and to the airport at 15.000 (jap.yen), (from 1 to 3 people, from 4 to 5 people Y20.000 (jap.yen) and from 6 to 7 people, 27.000 (jap.yen)
stormagnet says, "that's for the pick-up"
stormagnet says, "those would be shuttle busses, which are phenomenally expensive"
Crag says, "Pickup costs 6 times as much as a room?!"
Crag says, "that's wild"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Take The Freaking Train"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "the busses are basically a Dumb Tourist ripoff"
Crag says, "oh ok"
Crag says, "For people who can't devide by 100"
stormagnet says, "since the trains are so complicated a lot of foreigners take one look and throw up their hands"
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "seriously"
Crag says, "In my head the tourists' hands were detached from their wrists"
Crag says, "But now I'm imagining the hands coming out of their mouthes"
Crag says, "mouths"
Crag says, "Why are there all these tourist hands under this map here?"
Crag says, "Somebody come clean this up!"
Crag says, "alright, I'm off.  You sleep well"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "Can you email me the info for your flight please?"
Crag says, "I'll formally request the time off today"
stormagnet nods
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "I can"
Crag says, "I can't wait to see you"
stormagnet hugs!!!
stormagnet . o O ( the apostrophe strikes again! )
Crag says, "they do that!"
stormagnet . o O ( apAstrophe! )
Crag says, "When Marco chewed through the keyboard cable he was trying to save me from typos."
Crag says, "ok, I'm outa here! :)"
Crag idles: STORMY'S COMING HOME!!!
[Idling at 8:14 A.M. on Thu, Nov 15: STORMY'S COMING HOME!!!]
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty stoked that the flight I got is non-stop both ways"
stormagnet says, "flying all the way down to LAX, only to have the plane turn right around and head north again.... was not cool"
stormagnet says, "even if it did save money"
stormagnet says, "the non-stop is way faster :)"
stormagnet cuddles
stormagnet idles: see you in my dreams :)
Crag says, "Ty has not sent the stuff yet.  His explination was that he was doing the car's tags first.  I don't know what one has to do with the other.  But I'm getting the stuff from him tonight."
Crag says, "So I will send it tomorrow.  Somehow."
Crag heaves a big huge mondo sigh.
Crag says, "I knew dealing with Ty was going to be difficult"
Crag says, "But I don't know what else I could have done except sell Zippo, and I didn't want to do that either."
Crag says, "My meeting with the headhunters went well, I think."
Crag says, "The first position they're considering me a candidate for is with Getty Images."
Crag says, "I'm not holding my breath."
Crag says, "But I will update my resume tonight, anyway."
Crag idles: 'happy' hour
[Idling at 4:14 P.M. on Thu, Nov 15: 'happy' hour]
stormagnet hugs!
stormagnet says, "if he doesn't send that package this week, you should tell him not to bother sending it at all- it won't get to Japan before I come home for Christmas >_<"
stormagnet says, "I'll manage"
stormagnet says, "I'm running out of medication, to; but I noticed too late, so I'm going to try and get it over here"
stormagnet says, "but if I can't, I might need you to FedEx it >_<"
stormagnet kicks herself, and marks her calendar to remind her when to deal with the others
stormagnet says, "I've cut down on my bedtime meds, in order to avoid being to groggy in the morning for class, so that's stretched out my supply of those nicely"
stormagnet says, "but the migraine meds are almost tapped out, and I didn't notice, precisely because there was so much left of the other two"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "did you get in touch with Capital One yet?"
stormagnet says, "or are you still being foiled by their voice tree?"
stormagnet shakes her tiny fist at voice trees everywhere that deliberately stymie attempts to speak to actual customer service reps
stormagnet says, "I was hoping to place that Amazon order, and such"
stormagnet says, "but I just bought that plane ticket, too, so even if I wree willing to swallow BofA's transaction fees, after paying off CaPOne, there isn't enough buffer left for me to want to use it"
stormagnet will just have to be patient for once :/
stormagnet says, "aw, crap"
stormagnet says, "we might have to move some back into checking from savings after all"
stormagnet says, "the ticket was $1139"
stormagnet says, "and the available balance is only $1,236.68"
stormagnet says, "and I have to go pick up meds on again on tuesday"
stormagnet >_<
stormagnet says, "at least I'll be submitting my paperwork for part-time employment on Tuesday"
stormagnet says, "I should pry hold off on the dictionary and Baccano all together"
stormagnet says, "and I think I can get by a little longer without a lap blanket, too"
stormagnet says, "it hasn't been raining all that much"
Crag wakes long enough to read scroll at least...
Crag checks BofA...
Crag says, "The Available Balance isn't reflecting last night's payroll deposit."
Crag says, "payroll was 1193 this week"
Crag says, "not to be confused with the 1139 for your tickets :)"
Crag says, "Or maybe the available balance is showing the tickets and the regular balance isn't"
Crag says, "Either way I think we're OK"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "The difference between available and regular is 1241"
Crag says, "So it's more likely that the second explination is correct"
Crag says, "available = balance - (tickets + whatever I spent last night)"
Crag says, "Goodness, I'll have to get up extra early on the 21st to meet you at the airport. :)"
Crag says, "I'm not complaining or anything, just noticing."
Crag says, "I haven't gotten through to CapOne yet.  I will try again tonight after work."
Crag says, "And Ty has not sent the stuff off and I told him to give it all back to me."
Crag says, "He was going to give it to me last night but we were too busy carousing"
Crag says, "It's finally got rainy here"
Crag says, "I gotta go to work now.  I guess I'll see you tonight"
Crag idles: How do I stab people in this job?
[Idling at 8:24 A.M. on Fri, Nov 16: How do I stab people in this job?]
Crag says, "I'm home now"
Crag says, "Violent Acres has another awesome post up today"

Crag says, "and now it's bath time"
Crag <- back
Crag says, "I'm buying the hard drive I will use for the wrack replacement system"
Crag says, "Er, maybe"
Crag says, "yes, I am"
Crag says, "probably."
Crag . o O ( you don't want to know )
Crag says, "the drive is ordered"
Crag says, "Should be here in time for me to make use of it next weekend."
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "If they don't process the order until Monday, and the holiday weekend interferes it could be here as late as Tuesday next."
Crag says, "But if they process it tomorrow it could be here Monday or Tuesday."
Crag idles: it's been a long week
[Idling at 7:49 P.M. on Fri, Nov 16: it's been a long week]
stormagnet wakes, finally!
stormagnet says, "meant to get up early to start studying for her exam, and failed miserably to set her alarm O_o"
stormagnet cheers for the new drive, and for mistaking balances!
stormagnet says, "dang, I didn't *miss* you, did I?"
stormagnet says, "8pm on a Friday?!"
stormagnet panics!
stormagnet says, "I guess I can try and keep checking in on here while I study..."
stormagnet feel free to text me if you get back and I'm non-responsive!
stormagnet says, "er, mav..."
stormagnet says, "oh!"
stormagnet says, "for that matter, send me a text message from your phone to that stormagnet@softbank.ne.jp address"
stormagnet says, "so I can text your phone from mine"
stormagnet . o O ( WHY didn't I think of that sooner?! )
stormagnet reads Violent Acres
stormagnet laughs hysterically over the debate about whether or not to help the tenn-whore-shoplifters
stormagnet also cheers for getting backup on the LOLFatties vs Actually Disabled
stormagnet | My husband, noticing what I had tucked under my arm, immediately veered away from me until he had put a significant amount of distance between us. He does this every time he.s with me and I do something stupid. That way, if shit escalates, he.s available to bail me out of jail.
stormagnet says, "that"
stormagnet says, "is BEAUTIFUL"
stormagnet says, "a storybook marriage!"
stormagnet says, "brilliant!!"
stormagnet | At this point in time, people were starting to stop and watch the confrontation. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the two thieving teenagers duck out of the store with obviously guilty expressions on their faces.
stormagnet says, "AWESOME"
stormagnet says, "I get special vicarious joy out of this, since my capacity for Starting Shit For Fun kind ended with the whole Poster Child thing"
stormagnet says, "which is why I kind of live for chances to Legitimately Start Shit As A Poster Child"
stormagnet says, "like when the cops were blocking the ramp, forcing me to go an extra block"
stormagnet says, "actually, more like an extra TWO, since we had to double back"
stormagnet BWAHS at the bananna bit
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "before I forget!"
stormagnet says, "I heard that there's a standard fee for switching a phone to 'maintain # and contract, but otherwise freeze service' thing"
stormagnet says, "about $30 a month"
stormagnet says, "I don't know if we pay more than $30 a month for a two phone plan instead of a 1 phone plan, but if we do, we should get that set up"
stormagnet says, "I heard this from Rose, the other female UW exchange student"
stormagnet says, "and she learned this when she was working for Qwest"
stormagnet says, "and she said you have to be kind of assertive about it, because the phone companies generally don't want people to know that this is an option"
stormagnet says, "and that lower level customer service might not be all that informed about it"
stormagnet says, "so if you get blown off, ask to speak to the manager"
Crag wales
Crag wakes even
stormagnet cheers!!
Crag says, "oh hey"
Crag says, "I sent you a message anyway so you can text my phone and stuff"
Crag says, "I will figure out the phone thing when I have the phone in hand"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet is saving it now!
Crag says, "AlsoI think Rose is a nice name :)"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "she also goes by her middle name"
stormagnet says, "her first name is Jenniffer"
Crag says, "Oh"
Crag says, "Well you know I like that name."
Crag says, "wow, Jennifer Rose."
stormagnet says, "middle names tend to be prettier, and more unique, than first names"
Crag says, "Bring her back with you, please?"
stormagnet says, "because if the kid is embarrassed by it, they can always relegate it to initial"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet will try
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "she's really cute, too :)"
Crag sighs dramatically!
Crag says, "Sneak a picture or something!"
stormagnet will try :)
Crag says, "I'm sure we could find room for her in the apartment."
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "omg, this is my first time having used it, but this phone has a rad feature"
stormagnet says, "I hope other phones in the US implement it"
stormagnet says, "it has a digital answering machine!"
stormagnet says, "for when you want to use it for call screening"
stormagnet says, "and don't want to mess with voicemail"
Crag says, "So it takes the call but acts as an answeringmachine.  Brilliant."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that's genius"
stormagnet says, "you can set it to play back on speakerphone, too"
stormagnet says, "or mute"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I want that feature"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "That's how cell phones should be!"
Crag says, "voicemail should just be a fallback for bad reception."
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "By default it should go into the phone"
Crag says, "Then you don't spend airtime checking voice mail."
Crag says, ""
Crag says, "Though"
Crag says, "You'd still spend airtime receiving the message"
Crag says, "But you can listen to it over and over without paying extra"
Crag says, "That's my point"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "export, even"
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet says, "tho checking voicemail is pretty much always free"
stormagnet says, "but it depends on network"
Crag says, "I also want voice mail to download to my phone as soon as my phone comes back online"
stormagnet says, "and it's generally a pain in the ass to navigate"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "but best of all is that you can pick up midway"
stormagnet says, "if it's someone you want to talk to"
Crag says, "So you can actually screen your calls"
Crag says, "Like we used to with answering machines."
stormagnet says, "and you can hear the content without interrupting what you're doing"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "exactly"
Crag says, "That is great"
Crag says, "SO!"
Crag says, "you uh... wanna watch something?"
Crag says, "I just need to put on some underwear and I'm ready to go..."
Crag says, "Ok, underwear is in place"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "Edo Rocket?"
Crag says, "Or something else?"
Crag says, "I don't know what you have on hand."
stormagnet checks what she's got
stormagnet says, "yeah, looks like Edo Rocket's all I've got"
Crag says, "We should figure out what you need to download before we start"
stormagnet says, "is there something else I shopuld queue, while I'm at it?"
Crag laughs
stormagnet loses!
Crag wins.
Crag says, "let's see..."
Crag says, "I have so much..."
Crag says, "Um"
Crag says, "I need to see what's in for-stormy too"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "that sounds promising :)"
Crag says, "Did you check out El Cazador de la Bruja?"
Crag says, "That's the series with ties to Noir"
Crag says, "I've seen 4 episodes"
stormagnet says, "not yet"
Crag says, "All 26 eps are in for-stormy"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That's probably a good bet"
stormagnet says, "I downloaded them all, too"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "oh, perfect"
stormagnet says, "I haven't watched any yet, tho"
Crag says, "how much space do you have left?"
stormagnet peers
Crag says, "I'll look for something silly for you to download"
stormagnet says, "oh, eep- they downloaded out of order"
stormagnet says, "I have 1-3 and 26"
stormagnet says, "for some weird reason"
Crag says, "you should grab 4-25 :)"
Crag says, "But still"
stormagnet says, "when I saw 26 finish, I thought they were done ^_^;"
Crag says, "That's a lot of disk space"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "3.73G left"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "That's not bad"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet starts queuing up 3-25
Crag says, "Lemme see how big the rest of El Cazador is"
stormagnet says, "er, 4"
Crag says, "er, it's 4gig all together, including 1-3 and 26"
Crag says, "You'll be pusing it"
Crag says, "pushing"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'll go through 10"
Crag says, "Good plan"
stormagnet says, "and add stuff as we watch :)"
Crag says, "right!"
Crag says, "Ok then"
stormagnet says, "1 for 1 :)"
Crag says, "On to Edo Rocket?"
stormagnet says, "soon as I finish queueing :)"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "I'll make tea then!"
Crag says, "Oh!  I have more bamboo blade I didn't know about..."
Crag says, "We'll have to check that out soon too :)"
Crag makes tea first
stormagnet squuuueeeeeees for Bamboo Blade!
stormagnet will queue that next, please!
stormagnet says, "oops, I only have Edo Rocket through 11, too"
stormagnet piles that on the stack
Crag says, "6 and 7 are in for-stormy now"
stormagnet says, "w00t!"
Crag says, "We can watch Edo Rocket 8-11 at least :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That's a good hour and change right there"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet starts Bamboo Blade right away

stormagnet says, "I need to at least nominally work on studying for my exam, too"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "so I can't watch TOO much"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I'm pretty sleepy so I won't be too much trouble for you"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "BUT"
Crag says, "We need to free up more space on your laptop"
stormagnet says, "we can always watch more when you wake up tomorrow :)"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "because I have a lot more stuff for you"
stormagnet says, "that is also a priority :)"
Crag says, "I think you will want to watch Sky Girls even if it is formulaic and cheesy and predictable."
stormagnet says, "aaaand I have all of next week off after monday"
stormagnet says, "for the culture festival (squeeeee!)"
Crag says, "wheee!"
Crag says, "Next week should be easy for me"
stormagnet says, "so we can have much watchening then, too :)"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I have class for three days (maybe) and then four day weekend"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeet"
stormagnet says, "that's perfect!"
Crag says, "Oh, I need to tell Sue I'm game for Thursday too"
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Oh, but"
stormagnet says, "and since I won't be going to Osaka after all, I'm wide open"
Crag says, "After that drive shows up there may be DownTime"
Crag says, "I'll keep you posted"
stormagnet says, "it could be while I'"

Crag says, "I feel out of place in athletic settings"
Crag says, "Just like I do in fancy settings (suit and tie)"
Crag says, "and... almost every other setting, come to think of it"
Crag says, "This is a recurring theme with me"
Crag [mocking himself]: I don't belong in a grocery store!  This is a place for other people.  Not me.
Crag [mocking himself]: I don't belong at this party!  This is a place for other people.  Not me.
Crag says, "etc"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that actually sounds like exactly the kind of thinking that leads to hikkikomori syndrome in Japan"
stormagnet says, "since sense of belonging and setting and appropriateness are all so hyper codified and emphasized here"
stormagnet says, "you shouldn't sweat it so much :)"
Crag says, "I exagerate for clarity"

Crag says, "Yeah, but I don't really like the outdoors that much either :)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "I don't have the "not belonging" problem with the outdoors"
Crag says, "I mean, that would be impossible."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I just find it inconvienient and unrewarding"
Crag says, "My enjoyment of bike riding came from somewhere else"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but, I think other bicyclists have that in common"
Crag says, "How's your kettle?"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I have tea :)"

Crag says, "Wow, it only took about 10 minutes to download."
Crag says, "that's pretty great"
Crag says, "Wow, another cool thing about Alley24: they replace the light bulbs that came with the place for free"

Crag idles: dreaming of a cure for sleep
[Idling at 8:48 P.M. on Sat, Nov 17: dreaming of a cure for sleep]
stormagnet says, "wow, that's awesome- about maintanence!"
stormagnet is back from the shoot a little 'early'
stormagnet says, "mmmmm.... spontaneous party"

stormagnet says, "so I snuck out"
stormagnet says, "with notice and permission at our *one* ten minute break"
stormagnet says, "in what had been a 6 hour session"

stormagnet is such a wuss
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "I has a kotatsu"
stormagnet says, "coming home to it felt. SO. GOOD."
stormagnet says, "but I;m going to need to start looking for a truly decent pair of gloves"
stormagnet says, "like, crappy acrylic mittens are NOT going to cut it O_o"
stormagnet says, "esp. since I can't keep the hand that works the controller on my chair in my pocket"
stormagnet says, "but"
stormagnet says, "come to think of it"
stormagnet says, "I could *totally* smuggle a hot water bottle in my seat in the morning"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeeeeet"
stormagnet says, "I should get one in Seattle, though, and bring it back"
stormagnet says, "hot water bottles are just unreasonably expensive here"
stormagnet says, "like, $25"
stormagnet says, "I evehn saw some *electric* lap blankets"
stormagnet says, "but I don't know if those are battery-operatable"
stormagnet says, "I suspect they plug into the wall"
stormagnet says, "a lot of Japanese people seem to use them while working at a desk, or sitting on the couch"
stormagnet says, "a lot of adds are coming out for remedies for chillblains and cracked skin"
stormagnet says, "from exposure to the cold"
stormagnet says, "they are scaring me O_o"

Crag says, "hard to say"
stormagnet says, "they're all... confused"
Crag says, "I'll put it this way"
Crag says, "I have an 'untested' directory"
Crag says, "And after watching an episode or two I move dirs from untested to 'watching', 'watch later' or 'waiting for more'"
Crag says, "Or 'recycle bin'"
stormagnet says, "you left it in untested"
Crag says, "In this case, I'm not only not moving the directory"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "I didn't even move the first two episodes to 'seen'"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I will re-watch them both"
stormagnet says, "I'll watch it"
stormagnet says, "maybe I can help clarify"
stormagnet :)
Crag says, "it's like those OVAs where you're expected to know stuff already, except it's not an OVA and it's not a sequel."
Crag says, "sounds like a plan"
Crag says, "I'll move it to for-stormy"
Crag says, "I guess I'll move maple story for you too"
Crag says, "Since I have three episodes"
stormagnet says, "unexpected particle would make a good band name.."
Crag says, "Yes, I agree"
don't mind stormagnet, she's reviewing vocabulary
Crag giggles
Crag doesn't mind.
stormagnet says, "don't mind!"
stormagnet says, "it cracks me up that that's Engrish for 'never mind'"
Crag says, "me too"
Crag says, "languages break the funniest at their boundaries with other languages"
stormagnet says, "in phrasing like the above, the transposition works, but NOT ANYWHERE ELSE"
stormagnet . o O ( hi! i have had energy drinks! )
Crag says, "yays!"
Crag says, "I wish I had"
stormagnet says, "the ones here still taste like ass, but you swig them down as a shot, rather than sipping"
stormagnet says, "which might make them easier for you to bear"
Crag says, "I'm still copying all my recent downloads into 'waiting for more'"
Crag says, "Swigging could help"
Crag says, ""

Crag says, "Hm, that's a thought"
Crag says, "Martha has low blood bressure"
Crag says, "Or at least she always claimed she did"
Crag says, "I don't remember he talking about it recently"
Crag says, "But it's never come up in an exam either"
Crag says, "not that they look for it either"
Crag says, "fuckers"
stormagnet says, "they really, really don't"
stormagnet says, "since lots of people have low blood pressure from training etc"
stormagnet says, "and arte non-symptomatic"
Crag says, "Oh!"
stormagnet says, "but then people who are can have normal seeming bloodpressure"
stormagnet says, "because the doc doesn't know that it's lower than their ideal"
stormagnet says, "averages are really misleading"
Crag says, "I have another interesting download"
stormagnet says, "and so, of course, no one realizes how much of a problem it can be"
stormagnet says, "it's kind of a relief that they take it so much more seriously in Japan"
stormagnet says, "yeah?"
Crag says, "I should look into that at some point"
Crag says, "But the interesting download!"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "It's about incest!"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "But that's not the best part!"
stormagnet says, "I saw that!"
stormagnet says, "in your directory!"
Crag says, "It's from the creator of one of the shows we really liked"
stormagnet says, "I've read the manga, actually!"
Crag says, "ANd now I can't remember which one!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "and that's why"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "it's good"
Crag says, "Checking ANN..."
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "Lucky Star"
stormagnet says, "daaaaang"
stormagnet says, "that's not the one I was thinking of"
Crag says, "Series composer of Lucky Star did Screenplay of Boku whatever"
stormagnet says, "I read another manga by the same artist, I think"
stormagnet says, "AH"
stormagnet says, "that would be it"
stormagnet says, "Bokura ga Ita"
stormagnet says, "I think there was one more link, too, tho"
stormagnet says, "crazy, huh"
Crag says, "I think so too"
Crag says, "It's not Bokura ga Ita, though"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "the manga art was really similar, tho"
Crag says, "it's Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru"
stormagnet says, "that;s the title, yeah :P"
Crag says, "Checkign artists..."
stormagnet says, "I thought you meant the other series :P"
stormagnet says, "aw poo"
Crag says, "Here's the ANN page:"

Crag says, "She's at work today"
Crag says, "You could email her (nicole.bade@dig.com)"
stormagnet says, "nah, we're about to watch stuff anyway"
Crag says, "Well alright"
stormagnet says, "their character design really changed"
Crag says, "Sundays are usually pretty slow.  Maybe I'll drop by work on my way to game."
stormagnet says, "from the manga, that is"
stormagnet says, "but it was kind of old"
stormagnet says, "WAIT"
stormagnet says, "I'm thinking about a different one!"
stormagnet says, "I think we watched it together, too"
stormagnet says, "it was made into an anime too"
Crag says, "If you're talking about the two families who swapped parents and stayed together, yeah"
Crag says, "I remember that one"
stormagnet says, "no, that's Marmalade Boy"
stormagnet says, "not actually incest"
stormagnet says, "but an awesome classic saeries :)"
stormagnet says, "aaah"
Crag says, "right"
stormagnet says, "koi kaze, I think it was called"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "your copying done yet?"
Crag says, "I also have two episodes of an old Danish cartoon that was dubbed into Japanese and then fan subbed into english"
Crag says, "Alfred J Kwak"
stormagnet says, "sweeeeet!"
Crag says, "I didn't like it"
Crag says, "But you should check it out :)"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "It didn't hold together for me at all"
stormagnet is looking forward to the babelfish effect ^_^
Crag says, "The older stuff is much harder for me to get into"
Crag says, "ah but"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "aaanyway"
Crag says, "the subbers translated from danish"
stormagnet says, "aaaaaah"
Crag says, "Yeah, I'm done copying :)"
Crag says, "just had to get all those orders of business taken care of"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "hee"
Crag says, "Are you queued up for Baccano 12?"
stormagnet says, "oh fuck yeah"
stormagnet has been, ever since she said 'locked and loaded'
Crag says, "Ok, here we go..."
Crag | START
stormagnet rocks!
Crag says, "Only one more episode after this!"
stormagnet says, "eeeep!"
Crag says, "I hope those responsible make more good stuff :)"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "the books cover way more"
stormagnet says, "this is but a single story arc!"
Crag says, "Oh!  Maybe there will be another season or something"
stormagnet says, "can you believe it?!"
Crag says, "wow"
Crag says, "It's hard to believe"
stormagnet hopes so!
stormagnet says, "it's wildly popular, too, from thew look of"
stormagnet says, "the books on Amazon keep selling out"
stormagnet says, "and they auction for a ton of money"
Crag says, "If it's that successful it may go straight to license after the first season"
stormagnet hopes so!
Crag says, "which would incur annoying delays in our watching!"
Crag says, "but yeah"
stormagnet says, "unless you start learning Japanese too :P"
Crag says, "I see charachters with no mouths (just huge messes on desks) and I think lazy animators, but on this one we know better :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "in this case, it's stylization"
Crag says, "I might have to at that"
stormagnet says, "she's awesome!"
Crag says, "totally!"
Crag says, "This is such an RPG!"
stormagnet NODS!
Crag laughs
Crag says, "yeah, shut it Nicolas!"
stormagnet says, "god he's such a dick"
stormagnet says, "he needs to shut it"
Crag pfft
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "I was ready to like him"
stormagnet says, "the point is to consider that possibility, realize it is irrelevant, and MOVE THE FUCK ON"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "SWEET!"
stormagnet says, "save him"
stormagnet says, "make him stop being psycho!"
Crag says, "They're just crazy enough to do it!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "midnight bomber with bombs at midnight!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I love those sounds she was making"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "oh boy"
stormagnet says, "a true believer"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "they are so crazy"
stormagnet LAUGHS SOMNE MORE
Crag says, "ow!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "BWAH"
Crag says, "Nobody was going to look there."
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "you know you love it"
Crag says, "totally!"
Crag says, "WOW!"
Crag says, "WHAT!"
stormagnet says, "she's saving *everybody*"
Crag says, "holy crap"
stormagnet says, "NICE"
stormagnet says, "HOW CONVENIENT"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "he has a light"
stormagnet says, "NICE"
Crag says, "wild ride!"
stormagnet says, "NICE"
Crag says, "hot damn"
stormagnet says, "um"
stormagnet says, "no"
Crag says, "heh, he's so wrong :)"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "damn"
stormagnet says, "he has no idea what he's messing with"
stormagnet says, "hubris"
Crag says, "now we have to wait another week or so for the finale!"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet sniffles!
stormagnet says, "ah, well"
stormagnet says, "I need to go nap soon"
stormagnet says, "anyway"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I've got to get ready for game :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm guessing Rail Tracer is "chaotic good""
Crag says, "I suppose"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "His definition of good is chaotic"
Crag says, "Does that fit the meaning of the phrase?"
stormagnet says, "not really"
stormagnet says, "he has a very clearly defioned sense of good"
stormagnet says, "his way of enforcing it (his actions) are chaotic"
stormagnet says, "is ideals are good"
Crag says, "it wasn't clear to me :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "These shows are very hard for me to follow"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "he's not actually good"
stormagnet says, "he's certainly not lawful good"
Crag says, "certainly not"
Crag says, "Making players declare their alignment is so 1979!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but it's fun to go with the rpg instinct"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I could see some people in our crowd playing a charachter like that"
stormagnet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)
stormagnet says, "oh yeah"
Crag says, "Hah, I was just looking for that!"
stormagnet gives you a thumbs up!
Crag says, "Gud!"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag is trainable :)
stormagnet says, "dang, I hadn't heard of alignment languages"
stormagnet says, "that's wicked"
stormagnet has not actually *played* much Dungeons and Dragons
Crag says, "Alighment languages?"
stormagnet says, "true neutrals are pretty rad"
stormagnet is reading the wikipedia page
Crag reads
stormagnet says, "the dude in white is chaotic evil, totally"
stormagnet says, "Ladd, that is"
Crag says, "oh... yeah"
stormagnet says, "which is prety badass- a show down between two hard-core chaotics"
Crag says, "I think it's funny that you, a Libra, like the balanced alignment :)"
stormagnet says, "but of course!"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "it's also the most notoriously difficult to actually play"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "I'm usually most likely to play neutral good, I think :)"
Crag says, "These alignments don't fit my tendancies very well"
stormagnet says, "I'm usedto people who advocate much stricter harder-core examples than the wikipedia page, though :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "wikipedia is great"
stormagnet says, "that's why they eventually essentially ditched this system"
stormagnet says, "morals r hard, mmm'kay"
Crag says, "it's truuuuee!"
stormagnet says, "Lawful neutral is *Japan*"
Crag nods!
Crag says, "I think most new RPG systems would treat declared alignment as a hinderence you take on yourself"
Crag says, "I forget what you call that"
Crag says, "anti-perk"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "It's a constraint"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
Crag says, "You have to behave that way or take a penalty of some sort"
Crag says, "In Wild Talents you'd have to spend Will to go against your alignment"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And if you're out of Will you spend Base Will and if you're out of that you're a zombie"
stormagnet says, "and the more skewed the charachter, the more powerful but restricted"
Crag says, "totally"
Crag says, "And you get nothing for staying within the lines of your declaration"
stormagnet says, "I tend to think of those divisions as gradient axises, rather than strict divisions"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Totally"
Crag says, "everything is a gradient!"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "Has Quantum Mechanics taught us nothing?!"
Crag says, "Even (especially) existance"
stormagnet headbangs to thrash remix, "Everything is Gradient!"
Crag laughs!
stormagnet says, "with shouty vocals and snarly guitars"
Crag moshes!
stormagnet stoms!
stormagnet thrashes
stormagnet throws the horns!
Crag says, "woo!"
stormagnet says, "ok, enough partying"
stormagnet says, "I sleep now"
Crag says, "ok!"
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag says, "See you in a bunch of hours!"
Crag hugs!
Crag says, "Sleep awesomely!"
stormagnet says, "you betcha!"
Crag says, "FOr great justice!"
stormagnet will, hopefully!
stormagnet says, "for great justice!"
stormagnet says, "for not very long!"
Crag tucks you in, brings you a stuffy.
stormagnet says, "AW!"
stormagnet says, "thank youA!!!"
Crag says, "welcome :)"
stormagnet snuggles under blankety
stormagnet says, "I miss you so much"
Crag says, "Aw!"
Crag says, "I miss you too!"
stormagnet looks forward to Christmas!!!!!
Crag says, "me too!"
Crag says, "Best Christmas Ever!"
stormagnet says, "I'll be up again in about 4:30hrs"
stormagnet hugs!!!!
Crag says, "I'll still be at game then"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'll be back from game in about 10 hours :)"
stormagnet says, "I'll see you then, then :)"
Crag says, "ok!"
Crag says, "See you then!"
stormagnet idles: examinatin' the villagers
Crag idles: stealing magical rings from spider worshiping islanders!
[Idling at 8:15 A.M. on Sun, Nov 18: stealing magical rings from spider worshiping islanders!]
Crag wakes
Crag says, "Today's game was somewhat messed up by Ben being too hung over."
Crag says, "We're still having trouble working out some group dynamics, too"
Crag says, "Hayate no Gotoku 33 is out"
Crag says, "Based on past experience it should download in 10-20 minutes."
Crag says, "So anyway, today's game session:"
Crag says, "Everyone else was against me in my wanting to aquire the ring Ben had found in the temple."
Crag says, "After much discussion the only plan we could agree on was to run away to the beach and hope we could come up with a plan to get off the island then"
Crag says, "Oh, but before that..."
Crag says, "The villagers had a ceremony in which a younger couple was married and an older couple sacrificed themselves to the jungle, passing on their stuff to the younger couple."
Crag says, "Then some town elders went into a huddle and Al told us they were talking about what to do with us."
Crag says, "But while the elders were talking Al decided to contact the mute priest whom I met on the beach previously."
Crag says, "Interestingly, the priest refused to speak remotely as well, but they were able to communicate in gestures and images."
Crag says, "Lucky that Al can see in his mind without going crazy"
Crag says, "Al explained his own situation to the priest and the priest brought Al to a virtual monestary."
Crag says, "The priest had Al go into a confession booth.  The priest entered the other side and was thence able to speak."
Crag says, "The priest explained that he had vowed only to speak when specifically performing his priestly duties."
Crag says, "Al and the priest talked about Al's situation and came to no real conclusion"
Crag says, "But the priest did convince Al to participate in a virtual mass which lasted an actual 2.5 hours."
Crag says, "While Al was in his virtual mass the town elders made up their minds and went about their business."
Crag says, "We all sat around wondering what Al's problem was, but not wanting to disturb him either."
Crag says, "And in game we don't know much of the details of Al's experience with contacting the priest."
Crag says, "So next the town started doing another ceremony which seemed to be a re-enactment of their origin story."
Crag says, "We made the previously mentioned decision to get out of dodge."
Crag says, "We decided to leave in daylight because we would have better visibility and our torch would be harder to see."
Crag says, "Az (Shea's haitian) worked up a control spider spell that lasted just long enough for us to run through the jungle."
Crag says, "But the natives noticed and pursued us."
Crag says, "When we got to the beach the natives were still right behind us."
Crag says, "We did happen to notice that the Demon's Eye seemed to be in better condition than when we had left it, so we took a chance that it might be sea worthy."
Crag says, "I put Al on the latter and he climbed up."
Crag says, "Then I told Az and Jim to hold of the natives while I pushed the ship into the sea"
Crag says, "The priest was still there on the beach, so he helped fend off the locals too"
Crag says, "I was able to dislodge the ship from the beach, so we all scrambled aboard with relatively minor injuries"
Crag says, "We narrowly dodged some rocks on the way out of the lagoon and the natives seemed to give up on us for the time being."
Crag says, "The Demon's Eye was sailable, but not in good shape.  We did a loop around the island to see if we could see any land anywhere, but there was nothing."
Crag says, "We found we only had a couple weeks of food on us and decided to head west for the time being in hopes that we could improve our speed on the way by repairing the ship as we went.  Az got the wind to cooperate with us."
Crag says, "Once underway we all rested up, then gathered around the broken mast to see if Az could fix it."
Crag says, "He put a seed on the current top of the mast, then started his ceremony."
Crag says, "But the priest expressed objections.  We ignored him.  He insisted.  We ignored him.  Be started a prayer and started brandishing a gardening implement, so we jumped him."
Crag says, "Well, that priest was an ass kicker, let me tell you!"
Crag says, "He was fast and he hit hard."
Crag says, "He got me good twice and Jim's attacks didn't do much."
Crag says, "But Az was quick on his feat and freed the anchor."
Crag says, "We were still underway at a pretty good clip."
Crag says, "Everyone except me grabbed something or otherwise made sure they wouldn't be thrown overboard.  The priest went to the railing to hold on.  I jumped at the priest and tried to throw him over with my one good arm (he'd knocked the other out of commission)."
Crag says, "The ship turned to port hard as the anchor took hold.  The deck pitched way up.  The priest was holding on with one hand on the rail and the other holding onto his trowel which he had stuck in the railing."
Crag says, "I ended up holding onto the rail with just my good arm."
Crag says, "Jim tried to swing over to help and I tried to kick at the priest, but just before my blow might have landed he disappeared."
Crag says, "I cursed."
Crag says, "The ship righted itself.  We raised anchor, re-oriented towards the west and carried on."
Crag says, "Az performed his magic and succeeded in growing us a new fore mast."
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I forgot another detail."
Crag says, "The aft mast has a huge eyeball (about the size of two of Ed's fists, Greg said) impailed on it."
Crag says, "I tried to touch it and it twitched in a way which discouraged me from doing so."
Crag says, "It's still there :P"
Crag says, "ANYWAY"
Crag says, "We sailed west for a few more days (time enough to heal all our wounds and recover our will power)"
Crag says, "Next we spotted a french merchant vessel (the Rapide I think?)"
Crag says, "We put up a "let's talk" flag, and they put up a "mercy" flag, stayed away and kept their broadside facing us."
Crag says, "We put up a distress flag and they cautiously allowed us to get close enough to send over a longboat."
Crag says, "We sent Jim and Al over to try to get some food and directions to land."
Crag says, "Negotiations went poorly."
Crag says, "But we did get some food and our bearings."
Crag says, "Next we decided to sail to the nearest non-spanish port"
Crag says, "This is now Haiti but back then it was San Paulo or something."
Crag says, "When we got within view of there we ran out of wind, so we hung out for a while.  On Az's watch he spotted a French Galeon (not the same one we'd seen before) getting attacked.  We spontaneously decided to intervene."
Crag says, "We laid anchor and all four piled into the longboat and headed over."
Crag says, "We came aboard the attacker's ship from the opposite side of the ship they'd grappled."
Crag says, "When we came aboard we found that the captain and three sailors were abord watching the fight on the other ship."
Crag says, "They were all women!"
Crag says, "The captain was an abino woman.  She noticed us and brandished a sword at us and then Greg called it a good place to stop the session. :)"
Crag says, "I got Shea to come to Half Price Sunday with me"
Crag says, "So we spent a lot of time picking apart the session and the whole game"
Crag says, "We noted a number of horrible mistakes we'd made"
Crag says, "But we have a plan for next session which may work out very well for us."
Crag says, "Shea and I want to join forces with the women :)"
Crag says, "The problem is, we can't figure out how to get Ben and James to go along with some of our questionably aligned plans."
Crag says, "No doubt they see the women as the villains because they initiated the battle with the French galeon.  They will frustrate our efforts to join forces with the women."
Crag says, "Regardless of the outcome of that battle (if we live), we still have a problem going forward."
Crag says, "The Demon's Eye cannot be effectively used by three sighted sailors."
Crag says, "We need a crew"
Crag says, "The crew must either be zombies or we need a business plan."
Crag says, "Jim and Al will not go along with either of these."
Crag says, "Ed still thinks he's dreaming."
Crag says, "Priests do not disappear when people kick them."
Crag says, "Giant eyes do not live on the tips of ship's masts."
Crag says, "anyway, that's it for now."
Crag says, "I'm going to bed.  I may be up early, but I have to leave by 8 if not sooner."
Crag hugs and stuff
Crag idles: stupid work, be more awesome!
[Idling at 10:14 P.M. on Sun, Nov 18: stupid work, be more awesome!]
Crag says, "oh yeah, one more thing"
Crag says, "For lunch I had almost an entire roast chicken all to myself"
Crag says, "It was tasty"
[Idling at 10:17 P.M. on Sun, Nov 18: stupid work, be more awesome!]
stormagnet wakes-ish
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry for not chatting earlier >_<"
stormagnet says, "I was so wiped out with sleep dep I barely managed to send that message before konking out"
stormagnet says, "I didn't even wake up in time to run those errands"
stormagnet will have to do them tomorrow :/
stormagnet sleeps some more :)
Crag nods solemnly.
Crag idles: work
[Idling at 6:31 A.M. on Mon, Nov 19: work]
Crag wakes
Crag says, "I watched 10 minutes of Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru.  I didn't care for it at all and quit watching."
Crag says, "and we ran out of disk space on wrack again so downloading stopped"
Crag tries to free up some space
Crag says, "I sleep now.  May get up later for food."
Crag idles: nap
[Idling at 4:51 P.M. on Mon, Nov 19: nap]
Crag fails his stay asleep roll
Crag says, "Maybe I'll go to happy hour in a bit."
stormagnet wakes!!
stormagnet says, "I slept a ton"
stormagnet says, "Since I get 5 patches a week from the hospital, once a month I get to skip going"
stormagnet says, "THIS WAS THAT ONCE"
stormagnet overslept for Great Justice
stormagnet says, "I hella needed it, too"
Crag says, "Oh hi!"
Crag says, "I was in another window for a bit"
Crag says, "I want to sleep more, but it appears that the universe has other plans for me."
Crag says, "The class I'm doing at work is horrible"
Crag says, "It's training for another product we bought"
stormagnet says, "oh WEAK"
Crag says, "It's supposedly a five day class cut down to three"
stormagnet says, "uh-HUH"
Crag says, "But the product is so simple it could be a one day class"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "use the time constructively!"
Crag says, "I try"
stormagnet says, "bring your laptop"
stormagnet says, "'to take notes'"
Crag says, "They provide laptops"
stormagnet says, "you are very earnest!"
stormagnet says, "you are Very Serious about learning this product!"
Crag says, "Each laptop has a little vmware environment in which to do lab exercises or whatever"
Crag says, "I'm so serious I've almost been helping"
stormagnet says, "WEEEEAAAK!!!"
stormagnet says, "FOILED!"
Crag says, "When the teacher can't explain I cut in"
Crag says, "And explain way better"
stormagnet LAUGHS
Crag says, "Using Big Words that everyone already knows"
Crag says, "I think this teacher is ESL"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "He has a pretty bad accent and difficulties with things like "which" versus "who""
Crag says, "I think he's inexperienced and has low confidence too"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He's very repetitive"
stormagnet says, "ouch!"
stormagnet says, "he's probably working off a memorized script"
Crag says, "He'll say, "For example, suppose you have a windows server, for example, ....""
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He may be trying to"
stormagnet says, "definitely"
stormagnet says, "those are script memorization errors"
stormagnet says, "I used to do the same sort of thing when learning lines"
Crag says, "interesting"
Crag says, "He certainly doesn't have a firm grasp of the topics. :)"
stormagnet says, "it's like a memorization stutter"
Crag says, "He was able to answer some questions though"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "good on him for that"
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "Actually, thinking back, I'm not sure he did answer them"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "I bet this is one of their selling points too"
Crag says, "The class?"
stormagnet says, "Our product is featureful! It is Very Serious Software"
stormagnet says, "But never fear!"
Crag says, "Oh, that could be"
stormagnet says, "We *also* include a training class!!"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "We R Oracle!"
Crag says, "That's probably pretty standard at the Enterprise level"
Crag says, "heh, totally"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "That's the Oracle/Cisco standard model"
Crag says, "Sell rediculously expensive software that only certified professionals can run"
stormagnet says, "oh godDAMN it!!!"
Crag ?
stormagnet says, "this shop canxelled my lapblanket order AGAIN"
Crag says, "fuckers!"
stormagnet says, "I think they cannot fucking deal with overseas cards, period"
Crag says, "that could be"
stormagnet says, "that, or BofA has ALSO decided I'm suspicious"
Crag says, "It seems more likely to be the vendor."
stormagnet says, "@^$%@#%#$!!!!!"
stormagnet hopes so
Crag says, "BofA has no way of telling the difference between us"
stormagnet says, "the CapOne card really WAS blocking me, tho"
Crag says, "CapOne either for that matter"
Crag says, "So if you were blocked, I would be blocked too"
stormagnet says, "Because I used Amazon sucessfully once, but got blocked the second time"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "I still haven't talked to them"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But they haven't called either"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "ugh"
stormagnet says, "I think it's the vendor."
stormagnet says, "which SUCKS"
Crag nods and frowns and stuff.
stormagnet says, "because they were the cheapest"
stormagnet says, "AND the cutest"
Crag says, "aw"

stormagnet says, "good news: I can do COD"
stormagnet says, "bad news: there's a 420Y charge"
stormagnet says, "grrrr"
stormagnet says, "oh, well"
stormagnet says, "judging by our BofA transaction summary, there isn't much of a charge (or any) for withdrawing if I do it via one of the post office ATMs"
stormagnet says, "so in that sense, I can at least subtract the international transaction fee from that 420Y :/"
stormagnet says, "oooh- nowait, 315Y"
stormagnet misread fee table
stormagnet says, "meh"
stormagnet says, "I'll take it :)"

Crag says, "I had mozerella sticks and I'm sipping a cider."
Crag says, "I decided I was tired of hamburgers, but then not much else appealed to me either."
Crag says, "One TV is on the Discovery channel where there's a bunch of macho guys slobbering all over some grenade launcher or something."
Crag says, "On the other TV is some educational show about brains I think.  Except that they were showing lungs too, so maybe it's about fractals?"
Crag says, "And on the sound system there was some Ray Charles (I think), followed by the Beach Boys, followed by what I think is Beck trying to sound like Chris Isaac."
Crag says, "And now it looks like the discovery channel tv has switched to some sports channel or something where they're showingsome kind of ring fighting thing"
stormagnet says, "sweeet!"
stormagnet says, "sorry for the afk!"
stormagnet checks scroll
Crag says, "No prob"
Crag says, "I'm looking at my game notes"

stormagnet says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "grep?"
Crag says, "when the fur is flying I don't have time to type it up"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "No need to filter"
Crag says, "It's the editing that I'm too lazy for"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "I guess I could just copy it without editing it"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll do that this weekend if my hard drive doesn't arrive in time"
Crag says, "It shipped today"
Crag says, "Which means that at some point between Thursday and Monday, chez Sancho will be offline."
Crag says, "I'm having a second cider :)"

Crag says, "But anyway"
Crag says, "for the server project"
stormagnet says, "oooh"
Crag says, "I'm thinking I might set the MOO up first and not worry about the rest being offline for a bit"
stormagnet says, "speaking of desks"
stormagnet says, "hmmmmm"
Crag says, "yeah?"
stormagnet says, "we're in pretty good shape financially"
stormagnet says, "and I *did* get those plans drawn up"

Crag says, "Oh and then there's Yoshimune"
Crag says, "damn, so much to choose from"

Crag says, "less than a year"
stormagnet says, "but now it's gone"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "maybe I can find a doctor who can fix it"

stormagnet says, "I was planning to check out the Bunkasai today anyway..."
stormagnet idles: getting some culture with her takoyaki
stormagnet says, "ahhhh- it turns out the real festival is on the weekend"
stormagnet says, "the reson this week's classes are off is because these festivals are entirely organized and carried out by students"
stormagnet says, "so they get the time off to prepare the booths and such"
stormagnet says, "but I did go and get my kanji make-up tests over and done with, so it was hardly a lost cause ^_^"
stormagnet says, "OMFG"
stormagnet says, "the disclaimer in Potemayo 6 is *HILARIOUS*"
stormagnet says, "There is no air in space, so it is impossible for her hair and clothes to flutter."
stormagnet says, "It is a very stubborn image."
stormagnet dies!!!!!
stormagnet says, "They are my people!!!!!"
stormagnet says, "Kyou's mom is hilarious"
stormagnet says, "With the Guchiko traps"
stormagnet says, "But after Kyou and Guchiko, Nene is my favorite"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "She's.... so evil"
stormagnet says, "Yet adorable"
stormagnet says, "Yet eeeeevil"
stormagnet says, "And the brother"

stormagnet says, "with his blatant sister complex"
stormagnet says, "HILARIOUS"
stormagnet says, "ZOMG GINORMOUS ROOMBA!!!!"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "Nene's brothers, on the other hand"

stormagnet says, "are not remotely cute"
stormagnet says, "but her Mom is also HILARIOUS"
stormagnet says, "the joke with the backgrounds popping up behind them is that they are all named after trees"
stormagnet says, "Pine, Bamboo, Plum"
stormagnet tries to remember what kind of bread Guchiko came from
stormagnet . o O ( chocolate cornet? )
stormagnet . o O ( that would fit with the horns... )
stormagnet says, "mistranslation alert in number 7:"
stormagnet says, "it is not 'her first time learning to count'"
stormagnet says, "it's her 'first time getting an allowance'"
stormagnet . o O ( wtf, y'all? how do you mistranslate that?! )
stormagnet says, "there was something else earlier that bugged me, but it wasn't enough to remem..."
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "I remember"
stormagnet says, "not so much a translation as a tone error"
stormagnet says, "translating a butlers Uber-Keigo as"
stormagnet says, "What would you guys like to drink?"
stormagnet says, "is WAY off key"
stormagnet says, "it was more like, "Would you care for a beverage?""
stormagnet says, "oh crap"
stormagnet says, "I just remembered about region chipping >_<"
stormagnet says, "I have a classmate who's been playing games on hers, tho..."
stormagnet says, "I should ask her if she bought the PS2 here, or if it's chipped, or if she's managing to play them on an American one unchipped, or what"
Crag wakes
Crag says, "I slept for an actual 10 hours, feline interference not withstanding"
stormagnet says, "YAY SLEEP"
stormagnet says, "I, on the other hand, just read a long post detailing the buthery they're making of The Dark Is Rising for the movie adaptation"
Crag says, "The Dark Is Rising?"
stormagnet will not so much be SLEEPING, as huddled under the blankets quivering with RAGE and soaking the mattress with TEARS OF BLOOD
stormagnet says, "Susan Cooper"
stormagnet says, "It was, if I recall, VERY high on my list of Books We Should Read Together"
stormagnet says, "We still should, when I get back"
Crag says, "Ok"
Crag says, "I have no recollection :)"
stormagnet says, "but if I were to go anywhere NEAR the movie, it would just be so that I could make a scene and demand my money back"
stormagnet is not sure that would be worth the TAINT
Crag grins.
Crag says, "water dog!"
stormagnet says, "It goes beyond that"
stormagnet says, "this is.... un-fucking-believable"
stormagnet says, "I honestly cannot think of a WORSE movie adaptation"
stormagnet says, "EVER"
stormagnet says, "Worse than the Constantine movie"
stormagnet says, "Worse than if we even CONSIDERED Dracula 200 as being based on Brahm Stoker"
stormagnet says, "The director and script writer and actors all admit to NOT HAVING EVEN READ THE BOOKS"
Crag ..
stormagnet sobs
Crag says, "then why does the movie even share a title or anything?"
stormagnet says, "Picture doing Enders Game, and cutting out that annoying bit about aliens, and having them all be 20 years old, and it's an American military project, and space has nothing to do with it"
stormagnet says, "or something"
stormagnet says, "I can't even try to come up with an analogy"
stormagnet says, "it's hurting my head and making me want to cry"
Crag says, "weird"
stormagnet says, "OH AND THEY'Re ALL ON DRUGS"
stormagnet says, "....."
stormagnet says, "nope, not ewven close"
stormagnet says, "it's... horrible"
stormagnet says, "beyond horrible"
Crag frowns
stormagnet says, "I'd show you the page, excpet it's very spoilery for someone who hasn't read them yet"
Crag nods.
stormagnet sobs
stormagnet says, "THe REAL extra horrible tragedy?"
stormagnet says, "The author did not originally sell the rights to these hacks"
stormagnet says, "She sold them to HENSON"
stormagnet says, "but he DIED"
stormagnet says, "and the company just auctioned it off like a cheap lamp from an estate sale"
stormagnet says, "and there's NOTHING, NO legal recourse"
stormagnet says, "for her to stop them"
Crag says, "But why would someone buy that lamp and then use it as a jack for their truck at their next tailgate party?"
stormagnet says, "IT'S WORSE"
Crag says, "worse?!"
stormagnet says, "BECAUSE, SEE, THE BOOK IS ABOUT *MAGUIC*"
stormagnet says, "AND HARRY POTTER MADE LOTS OF MONEY"
stormagnet headdesks until her forehead is bloody
Crag says, "I'm so confused"
stormagnet says, ""I'm sorry"
stormagnet says, "I just couldn't keep it in"
Crag says, "that's ok"
stormagnet says, "when we read them, you'll understand"
stormagnet says, "just for example, though"
stormagnet says, "The protaganist is a quiet, intelligent 11 year old British boy"
stormagnet says, "Whose primary asset was his WITS and DIPLOMACY"
stormagnet says, "whioch is traditionally HELLA IMPORTANT when dealing with British tradition magic"
stormagnet says, "and he is very into Doing It Because it Is Right"
stormagnet says, "they made him into A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ANGSTY AMERICAN"
stormagnet says, "WHO USES HIS POWERS TO BLOW SHIT UP FOR FUN"
Crag says, "ok, I get that it's different"
Crag says, "I get that it sucks"
stormagnet says, "Just scratching the surface"
Crag says, "I understand"
Crag says, "I understand the magnatude of how bad this is"
Crag says, "What I'm having a hard time with is their motivation"
stormagnet says, "It Will Make Money"
Crag says, "Harry Potter didn't make money being different from the books"
stormagnet says, "this series is a bit more obscure"
stormagnet says, "and old"
stormagnet says, "but extremely well-loved"
Crag says, "But they didn't have to start from an old obscure book if they're basically starting from scratch"
Crag says, "All they're going to do is piss off the fans"
stormagnet says, "And being good and smart and history and beauty and love don't sell like swearing and punching people and blowing shit up and being an ASS-HOLE"
stormagnet says, "and that's THEIR idea of a HERO"
Crag says, "Then why not start completely from scratch?"
stormagnet says, "THEY DON'T HAVE THE CREATIVITY TO COME UP WITH A STORY"
Crag says, "crazy people"
stormagnet says, "so they rip shit off from someone who did and then hack it to bits pasting on bits and pieces that these idiots saw in Other Movies That Made Money"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "sorry"
Crag nods
stormagnet says, "from a social narrative standpoint"
stormagnet says, "this really just hit home"
stormagnet says, "it makes me feel, for a moment, that the world has truly become an evil place"
stormagnet says, "the changes they made turned the heros into idiotic bullies"
stormagnet says, "but you can tell who the villains are because They're Wearing Black"
stormagnet says, "really, bullies"
stormagnet says, "rude, obnoxious, selfish, shallow, stupid assholes"
Crag frowns
stormagnet says, "THESE are who we're supposed to look up to"
stormagnet says, "and if you're not, by god, they'll make you over until you ARE"
Crag hugs
Crag says, "I think you were in my dream this norning."
Crag says, "morning"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
Crag says, "I dreampt about playing some weird old-fashioned computer game with the nerdhalla folks"
Crag says, "And you had to play in ascii mode due to being remote while everyone else had monochrome graphics."
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag says, "And you showed me a funny screen shot where your tank was flipped upside down or something"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "and we laughed about it"
stormagnet says, "I like your dreams :)"
Crag heh
Crag says, "The game was awful"
Crag says, "It had a long setup and we never actually got to play because of it"
Crag says, "We were borrowing some space from some company or something"
Crag says, "And they kicked us out before we started."
stormagnet says, "punks!"
stormagnet kicks sand at them!
Crag says, "And the space was like a garage or something"
Crag heh
Crag says, "It was weird"
Crag says, "But I definitely remember that you were in my dream :)"
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs :)
Crag says, "Today will be a short day at work"
Crag says, "They always call short days before holidays"
stormagnet says, "awesome!"
Crag says, "I'm highly de-motivated"
stormagnet says, "when you get home we can watch stuff!"
Crag says, "You'll be asleep!"
stormagnet is cuddled up at the kotatsu again :)
Crag says, "yay kotatsu!"
stormagnet says, "if you give me a time, I will set an alarm!"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "3pm here, 8am there"
stormagnet says, "I can get up then!"
Crag says, "yay!"
stormagnet says, "that's when I normally have to get up for school, anyway"
Crag says, "That will make my day much better!"
stormagnet says, "actually, 15 minutes earlier"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag says, "awesome"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I should let you go to sleep now so you get 8 hours"
stormagnet says, "now that I've caught up on my sleep some, I'm trying to get on a more regular schedule"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet was thinking the same
Crag says, "Good plan"
Crag says, "I'll see you in eight hours :)"
stormagnet hugs!!!
Crag HUGS!

Crag says, "er, beer ad"
Crag says, "I like the beer ad version better than the original"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "The original is all fast and stompy, maybe a little sloppy"
Crag says, "The version in the commercial was super slow and epic"
Crag says, "Started with thee short chords played on a synth run through lots of effects"
Crag says, "And then the base and drums boil up underneath it"
Crag says, "It was very impressive for a stupid beer commercial :)"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "ANYWAY"
Crag says, "I forgot that Tiff had called me last night and I said I'd call back today"

stormagnet says, "Seikichi"
Crag says, "so now it looks like he caught them escaping"
stormagnet says, "nods"
stormagnet says, "er"
Crag says, "Still"
stormagnet says, "precisely"
Crag says, "why not shoot him right away?"
stormagnet says, "excuse to kill, instead of keep as captives"
Crag says, "It's still an obvious rescue attempt"
Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "I see"
stormagnet says, "then he wouldn't get to kill O-Sora"
stormagnet says, "right"
Crag frowns
stormagnet says, "and the rest, likely"

stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "oh gods I miss them so"
stormagnet says, "Mission-style burritos, very specifically"
stormagnet says, "very specifically Taco Del Mar style ones"
Crag says, "It's almost twice as far from Alameda to Tokyo as it is from Alameda to New Jersey"
stormagnet nods solemnly
stormagnet says, "you can't even get salsa and beans over here"
Crag says, "Maybe some kind of burrito ICBM"
stormagnet says, "maybe on special order"
Crag says, "If we can send a nuke to Asia, we can certainly send burritos!"
stormagnet says, "but they sure as hell aren't in any of the supermarkets or convenience stores I've been to"
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "We will make a fortune!"
stormagnet says, "REPENTANCE"
Crag says, "TOTALLY!"
stormagnet says, "we are very sorry about what those guys did, please have delicious burritos"
Crag says, "Special discount for survivors and their friends and family."
Crag says, "that would be pretty swell"
stormagnet says, "except most Japanese people pry won't like them"
stormagnet says, "they're REALLY weak on spicy things here"
stormagnet says, "it's killing me"
Crag says, "Taco Del Mar has a mild sauce..."
Crag says, "You could even get it without sauce"
stormagnet will be eating LOTS of spicy when she gets home
stormagnet says, "that might work"
stormagnet says, "travesty, but it might work"
Crag says, "We can find a way!"
Crag says, "We can do this!"
Crag says, "It will fund out backyard satelite project."
Crag says, "We will make a company that launches burritos around the world."
stormagnet says, "anyway, I am looking forward to lots of Burritos, cheap greasy pizza, mashed potatoes, and pub food"
Crag says, "And use the technology and money to sell satelite kits."
stormagnet says, "YES"
Crag says, "yay to all of that!"
stormagnet says, "mashed potatoes are another thing that it is impossible to find here"
stormagnet says, "KFC is all over the place, and actually a lot higher quality than in the US so far"
Crag says, "criminal!"
stormagnet says, "but they HAVE NO MASHED POTATOES"
stormagnet says, "but at least mashed potatoes I can make myself, if I weren't so lazy :/"
Crag says, "still"
Crag says, "Something must be done."

Crag says, "Oh, I had an interesting email from Greg.  He emailed us all requesting info about our charachters so he can post it in a forum about the game system"
Crag says, "He's also posting a log of our sessions"
Crag says, "And once he has all our stuff he's also going to post the stats of the priest and spider shaman"
stormagnet says, "NICE!!!"
Crag says, "I'll probably work on that tonight while you're doing your stuff"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "do you have Ekiga setup, btw?"
Crag says, "Ekiga?"
Crag says, "What's that?"
stormagnet says, "it looks like I can only call other Ekiga users, so I wanted to check"
stormagnet says, "the free software VoIP thing"
Crag says, "Oh"
stormagnet says, "that you recommended"
Crag says, "I probably have it, but I haven't tried using it"
Crag says, "I don't have the microphone part figured out yet"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "maybe I had best just use Skype, then"
stormagnet says, "So I can call the family tomorrow"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Er"
Crag says, "I definitely don't have Ekiga on the laptop"
stormagnet says, "never mind"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "Oh, but if you have it, I can"
Crag says, "because you're on windows"
stormagnet says, "anyway, I'm going to nap a little"

stormagnet says, "also, I forgot to charge me chair >_<"
stormagnet FAILS
stormagnet says, "I guess I'll nap a little more, and see if it's charged then"
stormagnet says, "I might still make it in time..."
Crag says, "I'm awake"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "I'll try calling BofA"
Crag says, "Or rather the number on the back"
Crag says, "I couldn't find a way in the phone tree to do anything about the card.  I'm going to check the website"
Crag says, "after I pee"
Crag says, "trying a different number now"
Crag says, "phone number"
Crag says, "I'm on hold"
stormagnet says, "oh yay, hold"
stormagnet hugs
stormagnet says, "thank you"
stormagnet says, "It looks like, after getting 3 whole business days off, I'm going to fail to make it on ANY of them"
stormagnet says, "I'll have to go next Tuesday"
Crag says, "They're re-directing me to the debit card department"
stormagnet says, "which may be for the best, anyway, since the City Office is close to the hospital, where I have to go waste time ANYWAY"
stormagnet says, "hmph"
stormagnet says, "that's one reason I need to get Skype or something set up instead of Ekiga"
stormagnet says, "even toll-free numbers are long distance here, and cost about a buck a minute"
stormagnet says, "the CapOne card, I couldn't do anything about, but I would have liked to be able to call BofA myself"
Crag says, "GAH"
stormagnet says, "I emailed one of the Rakuten stores, and they said the card system is the same for all of their stores"
Crag says, "call center closed for the holidays"
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet says, "AUIGH"

stormagnet says, "HATE"
stormagnet says, "that's it"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "Evergreen won't be any different"
stormagnet says, "we should officially go switch to Evergreen Bank"
stormagnet says, "On this?"
Crag says, "I don't think they will"
stormagnet says, "I think they might be better"
stormagnet says, "...."
Crag says, "They may even be worse because they're smaller"
stormagnet says, "hmm"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "ugh"
Crag says, "There's no harm in trying them"
stormagnet says, "but their Int. fees sounded better"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah, on that front they could be a win"
Crag says, "But don't get your hopes up"
stormagnet sighs
Crag says, "there are no good banks"
stormagnet says, "this day is made out of FAIL"
Crag says, "That's just not how the world work"

stormagnet nods
Crag says, "assuming I get through at all"
stormagnet says, "did you try saying, "assistance," "associate," "transfer," "help," and making static sounds?"
Crag says, "I didn't."
stormagnet says, "what are the tree options?"
stormagnet says, "did you find one that works?"
Crag says, ""Hold on :)"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "I'm trying the travel notification option"
Crag says, "crap, this is automated too"
Crag heh
Crag says, "When did you arrive over there?"
stormagnet says, "September 7th"
stormagnet says, "Seattle time"
Crag says, "It doesn't like me back-dating my travel date"
stormagnet says, "then, today"
stormagnet says, "whatever"
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "I was able to put in tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "And I put the end date as august 1st next year"
Crag says, "and then they said have a great trip :P"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "But"
Crag says, "They said "we'll process this as fast as we can""
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And I had to "say and spell" my name"
Crag says, "So there's still ways it could get fucked up"
stormagnet says, "I won't hold my breath"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I don't know what else to do"
Crag says, "I guess I could go to a BofA branch on Friday?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "if they're open"
stormagnet says, "but that's Thanksgiving, right?"
Crag says, "Thursday is thanksgiving"
stormagnet says, "oh"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "Friday is 'black friday', the biggest shoppign day of the year or whatever"
stormagnet says, "oh, right"
stormagnet says, "I'm a little worried"

stormagnet says, "and the sizes were included on the wisahlisted items"
stormagnet says, "and then she asked for my sizing information"
stormagnet says, "......"
stormagnet says, "I was very specific on purpose"
stormagnet says, "because...."
stormagnet says, "shh!"
stormagnet says, "secret!"
Crag's lips are sealed
stormagnet says, "the clothes she got me for my birthday wree god-awful >_<"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "color blind soccer mom"
stormagnet says, "in the wrong size"
stormagnet says, "baggy bright magenta cable knoit sweater"
Crag says, "I agree that you do have cause for concern"
stormagnet says, "but with a too-tight crewneck"
Crag says, "Not just because of the poor taste"
stormagnet says, "and elastic waist black courdurouy pants that are huge in the butt and too short :/"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "Danger"
stormagnet says, "Danger"
Crag says, "Thanks for the pictures, by the way. :)"

Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "static field?"

Crag says, "If it was the internet, why did telnet work?"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I mean, a specific limiting thing"
Crag says, "maybe"
Crag says, "Our tests were not complete"
stormagnet says, "I think they have some kind if restriction run amok"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Maybe I should write a script for you to run the next time it happens."
stormagnet says, "we should study it more later :)"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I'll think about throwing together a tidy little perl script to test your net."

Crag says, "I still have 8, lemme review :)"
Crag says, "I reviewed, I can't explain it."
stormagnet says, "ok"
Crag says, "That girl's dog coughed up the key and what's his name said he hates what's her name"
stormagnet says, "but I didn't accidentally delete one too many, that's the main thing"

Crag says, "Should I try to get up early?"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet says, "naw"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "that would just tempt me to stay up way too late again :)"
Crag says, "In that case just text me when you're online if I don't respond within a few minues."
stormagnet nods
Crag heh
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag says, "In that case I will now heed the call of the comfy bed"

Crag says, "They said as much"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "aw!"
stormagnet :(
stormagnet says, "but...."
Crag says, "The pystashio salad or whatever it is wasn't as popular because nobody felt like they had to fight for their share"

Crag wakes
Crag hrms
Crag says, "I'm sure Tiff has some sort of interest in me, but I'm having a REALLY hard time deciphering that the nature of that interest is."
Crag says, "It may be that my interest in Astrology is throwing me off."
Crag says, "She's a Scorpio, so no matter what she does I analyze it in terms of secret motives and manipulation."
Crag says, "Which is unfair, even if it's accurate."
Crag says, "But with that said, for any theory I have as to what her interest in me is, I can come up with a reason why that assessment might be wrong."
Crag says, "I'd like to just ask her, but I don't know how to do so politely and without risk of dampening her enthusiasm."
Crag says, "ANd the other factor to take into account is that I don't know what my interest in her is."
Crag says, "Which may be troublesome for her as well."
Crag says, "She seems to be a little high maintenance (about 0.2 Melanies?)"
Crag says, "And she says she's still getting over Eric"
Crag says, "If her interest is only as a friend (which would be fine, obviously), then her behaviors so far all the more confusing"
Crag says, "But it could be that circumstances are making her seem more interested than she intends to seem."
Crag says, "I would ask people who know her, but nobody who knows her well is someone I can confide in."
Crag says, "I wish you were coming home sooner."
Crag takes a bath
Crag says, "And now I'm going to go out and about."
Crag idles: out and about
[Idling at 1:47 P.M. on Fri, Nov 23: out and about]
stormagnet says, "I find it highly likely that she's interested in you"
stormagnet says, "especially since the poly conversation has already been broached, thanks to Ty :P"
stormagnet says, "But I'd say, just keep going like you are"
stormagnet says, "Be yourself"
stormagnet says, "Either she'll bring the subject up, or she won't"
stormagnet says, "and if she doesn't, it may be because she doesn't know what to think about it or what to say yet, either"
stormagnet says, "it may be a little awkward, but that's ok"
stormagnet says, "hell, savour the awkwardness :)"
stormagnet says, "that said, now that I've taken out the trash, I'm going back to bed-"
stormagnet says, "text me if you want to chat :)"
stormagnet says, "pk, I'm heading out to the culture festival!"
stormagnet says, "er, Ok"
stormagnet says, "sleep well!"
stormagnet idles: gettin' cultured
Crag says, "yay culture!"
Crag says, "you are no doubt devouring it"
Crag says, "Tom Patton asked me to tell you something in Japanese, but even though it was only half an hour ago I've forgotten it"
Crag says, "I filled him in on your adventures and he was impressed and pleased and stuff"
Crag says, "He had a lot of "That's what I figured" sort of responses"
Crag says, "And he was smiling and nodding and laughing a lot"
Crag says, "Tiff and I had a pretty great time today."
Crag says, "We went downtown on foot, but it was a total zoo"
Crag says, "So we ended up at the bar at the Cheesecake Factory"
Crag says, "And that was freaking delicious"
Crag says, "Then we came back to the apartment and I played a bunch of music for her that she hadn't heard of"
Crag says, "Then I lent her a big bag of CDs to rip"
Crag says, "And we have a plan to share more in both directions soon"
Crag says, "She also wants to get into Linux, and I think she's serious about it"
Crag says, "Though I don't think she knows yetexa why she's se"
Crag says, "yet"
Crag says, "er"
Crag says, "knows yet exactly WHY she's serious about it"
Crag says, "The party was strangely mellow"
Crag says, "John Charles was there with his new girl, but I didn't make an effort to investigate either of them"
Crag says, "John Denver also showed up with a couple of friends"
Crag says, "Billy made it just before the party shut down"
Crag says, "Riva and Nick made an appearance"
Crag says, "Sara was there without River"
Crag says, "Nicole was very absent"
Crag says, "Very in the sense that she doesn't work tomorrow, so ... wtf? :)"
Crag says, "Maybe I'll find out more tomorrow"
Crag says, "Ty showed up and tried to be interesting. :P"
Crag says, "OH!"
Crag says, "I subjected Tiff to Salad Fingers"
Crag says, "She was suitably disturbed!"
Crag says, "It was great."
Crag says, "I now understand the appeal of Salad Fingers."
Crag says, "It's the pleasure of making someone else watch!"
Crag says, "It's hilarious!"
Crag says, "ANYWAY"
Crag says, "Following up to my previous monologue and your reply, I completely agree with you, of course."
Crag says, "As for how I feel about Tiff, I'm enjoying watching and waiting a lot."
Crag says, "She vented with me a lot today, and it felt good to me."
Crag says, "I didn't tell her anything or advise her and she thanked me for that."
Crag says, "And that was very satisfying"
Crag says, "when it comes down to it, I like being needed."
Crag says, "She seems to need me in the way I am now, which is great."
Crag says, "So I agree doubly with your response. :)"
Crag says, "And now I have a cat in my lap.. and face."
Crag says, "A sancho"
Crag says, "ok, he's moved on to the synthesizer."
Crag says, "And now is time in sprockets where we dance."
Crag says, "And by dance I mean sleep"
Crag says, "I hope you got lots of culture today!"

stormagnet says, "she says you were 'quite lively and entertaining' at Thanksgiving :)"
stormagnet says, "ok, I gotta say"
stormagnet says, "less than 5 minutes into El Cazador, and I'm noticing strong thematic ties to both Noir and Madlax"
stormagnet says, "Not just stylistic, but plot themes"
stormagnet says, "as in, if this were by chance by the same people, it might end up tying the three together into a series"
stormagnet says, "ok, around 11 minutes in"
stormagnet says, "it's been a long time since I watched either Madlax or noir"
stormagnet says, "but if this *isn't* meant to tie those two series together"
stormagnet says, "than it's not even a rip-off- it's doujin"
stormagnet says, "fanfic, basically"
stormagnet says, "because this is definitely building on the same universe"
stormagnet says, "ok, I can't take it anymore"
stormagnet googles
stormagnet says, "ok, yeah, confirmed"
stormagnet says, "they're meant to be a trilogy"
stormagnet says, "you pry mentioned all this before when you first told me about the series"
stormagnet says, "but all I remembered was that it reminded you of it :)"

stormagnet says, "hmm"
stormagnet says, "meh"
stormagnet says, "it *totally* figures that this dude also did the soundtrack for Xenosaga"
stormagnet says, "since that's one of the things that hooked me on it"
stormagnet says, "wow, another Way that Today Was Not Fail"
stormagnet says, "but Was In Fact Win"
stormagnet says, "I got an email about the IPE scholarship"
stormagnet says, "not that I got it or didn't, mind you"
stormagnet says, "but that they were letting everyone know that the selection was being delayed, because they were trying to recruit more funds this year"
stormagnet says, "which means that at some point they're so deadlocked on the decision that it's essentially a tie, and they're trying to find away add another recepient"

Crag says, "Bu ru ma - broom?"
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "OH cool, your airline tickets hit the bank account yesterday."
Crag says, "So everything really is ok :)"
Crag says, "Our current (available) balance is just shy of $1600"
Crag says, "And I get another check before the end of the month."
Crag says, "AND I'm thinking about using one of the CapOne checks to pay rent"
stormagnet says, "hey, you're awake!!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Hey!  YOU'RE awake!"
stormagnet says, "Some of trhe words are Engrish, some aren't"
stormagnet says, "yeah ^_^;"
Crag says, "I win!"
stormagnet says, "I would avoid using the CapOne checks to pay rent"
Crag says, "Oh?"
stormagnet says, "we don't want to rack up a balance on it now that it's paid off"
stormagnet says, "why would you want to use on of those instead of just a regular check?"
stormagnet says, "we're not looking like we're in danger of overdrafting or anything"
Crag says, "Yeah, you're right"
stormagnet says, "despite my profligate clothes buying ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "I should order new BofA checks next week."
stormagnet says, "it would just end up making us have to pay extra interest on it"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I was planning to pay it off right away"
stormagnet says, "I know"
Crag says, "Do we pay interest on balances that don't last a month?"
stormagnet says, "I think we originally had a two week grace period before interest starts accumulating"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "our terms have changed considerably, due to missed payments and such -_-;"
Crag says, "I see"
Crag says, "Well we'll just not use it for a while then I guess"
stormagnet says, "I think we should try to avoid keeping a balance on that card, and use it just as a drop to avoid international transaction fees"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "and that keeps it open for emergencies, too"
Crag says, "Sounds good to me"
stormagnet says, "and avoiding keeping a balance on it will also improve your credit rating"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I'm glad we're doing so well ^_^"
Crag says, "Say, while you're awake you can help me"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm updating my amazon list"
stormagnet says, "I can try :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And I can't remember if we got Azumanga Daioh or Fruits Basket already"
Crag says, "I know we got Juuni Kokki"
stormagnet says, "Neither, as I recall"
Crag says, "Ok, I'll leave 'em on the list :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I have a translation clarification for El Cazador 2, by the way"
stormagnet says, "when she asks 'how good are your eyes anyway?' and Ellis replies 'I have two?'"
stormagnet says, "there is, as you may have guessed, a pun"
stormagnet says, "which is hard to translate naturally"
stormagnet says, "She asked what her vision rating is, basically"
stormagnet says, "like 20-/20, etc"
stormagnet says, "er"
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "20/20"
stormagnet says, "and the all-purpose word for this and any number-related question in Japanese is the same"
stormagnet says, "so it's literally your-eyes-how-many?"
stormagnet says, ""Maybe best as, "What number are your eyes?""
stormagnet says, "heh"
Crag says, "I see (har har)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Heh, I have some Ayn Rand on my wishlist"
stormagnet says, "know thy enemy, and all"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "I recommend using the library for those, though"
stormagnet says, "if only for the poetic justice"
Crag says, "I'm imagining you're mom's reaction to seeing it on my list though :)"
Crag heh
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "There is that."
Crag says, "I dunno, it's not like Ayn will see the profit from my purchase"
stormagnet says, "irojiro, by the way, was one of the mini vocabularly lessons I got off that menu :)"
stormagnet says, "one of those creepy Randian orgs might, tho"
stormagnet says, "irojiro is one of the few words that wasn't slang"
stormagnet says, "it translates literally as 'color-white'"
stormagnet says, "and is used to describe the pale, delicate sort of beauty"
stormagnet says, "which was kind of funny"
stormagnet says, "because the menu item it was attached to, I originally wanted to get first"
stormagnet says, "Peach Chuu-hai"
stormagnet says, "but, because I didn't know the word"
stormagnet says, "and was afraid it might be something super-pervy"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I went on the safe side and got the 'little sister' apple"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "what kind of pervy stuff did they have?"
stormagnet says, "Lolita- for a start"
stormagnet says, "though that was sold out ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "and the $10 special"
stormagnet says, "Megumi"
stormagnet says, "which was, apparantly, 'dynamite body'"
Crag ..
stormagnet says, "I suspect it was a special fan-service, rather than a drink"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "Is it... served differently? oh..."
stormagnet has NO idea
stormagnet says, "or rather"
stormagnet has TOO.MANY ideas
Crag giggles.
stormagnet says, "konhisokusu"
stormagnet says, "is indigo-colored thigh-highs"
stormagnet says, "which are, I gather, considered uniform-appropriate, and fetishized appropriately"
stormagnet says, "there was one on there that I never did figure out"
stormagnet says, "I'm going to look it up now :)"
stormagnet says, "bu-ru-ma is, of course, the infamous 'bloomers'"
stormagnet says, "those tiny gym-uniform short-shorts"
Crag says, "Ah, I should have figured that out"
stormagnet says, "that that one Azumanga pervy prof was obsessed with :)"
Crag says, "I recall :)"
stormagnet says, "man, even WWJDIC is failing on this one"
stormagnet says, "I chatted with the 'maids' a bit"
Crag says, "Yeah?"
stormagnet says, "and one tried to explain it to me"
stormagnet says, "I gather it's a loli-con related term"
stormagnet says, "I think it might be 'tsuru' for smooth"
stormagnet says, "and 'peta' for damp/sticky"
stormagnet says, "but I don;t know`what the larger meaning is... "
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag ..
stormagnet says, "burikko is 'fake-kid'"
stormagnet says, "a teenager/older who deliberately asks like a little kid for cute points"
Crag says, "Ah"
Crag says, "And these are all drinks?"
Crag says, "Or... something else?"
stormagnet says, "those were all drinks :)"
stormagnet says, "and the cafe itseld was called 'tsundere'"
stormagnet says, "which I'm sure you remember from Lucky Star"
stormagnet :P
Crag says, "I don't remember..."
Crag fails
Crag makes tea to try to fail less
stormagnet says, "ah- wikipedia to the rescue"
stormagnet says, "there's a page for tsurupeta"
stormagnet says, "ok, the term is used in adult games a lot"
Crag says, "uh oh :)"
stormagnet says, "and is loli-con specific"
stormagnet says, "the tsurutsuru 'smooth' part is the breats- or lack thereof, basically"
stormagnet says, "I"m stuck on the 'peta' part, though"
Crag says, "hm"
stormagnet says, "I gather it mostly refers to a pre-pubescent body type"
stormagnet O_o
Crag ..
Crag says, "alright then"
Crag says, "Well, I culled my wishlist a bit"
Crag says, "There's nothing on it I'm really excited about"
Crag says, "I don't really want _stuff_ anymore"
Crag says, "I'm still reeling from our last move"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "ok, pettan means flat"
stormagnet says, "so flat and smooth"
Crag says, "Ah"
stormagnet says, "So, in Ultimate Girls"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's too young even for me"
stormagnet says, "the blue haired one would be the tsurupeta"
stormagnet nods

Crag . o O ( pipe dance )
Crag is disturbed and amused by the Mai Otome Comparison - Breasts
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet had not followed that link, until you mentioned it
stormagnet says, "so"
stormagnet says, "ahen"
stormagnet says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "VERY educational"
Crag grins.
stormagnet says, "when I didn't understand her definition, the 'maid' cracked up and reassured me repeatedly that it was totally Not A Word I Needed To Know"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "I swear, quizzing them about the vocabulary was totally providing Fan Servioce for the other patrons"
Crag laughs
Crag says, "I wish I could have seen that"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Amazon needs some usability experts on staff"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Or needs to listen to the ones they have, if they have any"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "they're still better than most"
stormagnet says, "credit where credit's due"
Crag says, "true"
Crag says, "In Disney performance review parlance, they are "Leading The Way""
stormagnet says, "ooog"
Crag says, "Getting sleepy?"
stormagnet says, "nope"
stormagnet says, "just mildly queasy at executive jargon"
stormagnet says, "bleah"
Crag says, "oh, heh"
Crag says, "I'm innured to it now :P"
stormagnet says, "muah"
Crag says, "So .. you up for watching something?"
stormagnet nods
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "soon as I finish this episode, shall we watch more Denno?"
Crag says, "Yes"
Crag says, "Don't watch past ep 4 of El Cazador :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "wasn't intending to"
Crag says, "cool"
stormagnet says, "I'm still on 2"
Crag pokes around on amazon in the mean time
stormagnet says, "I had it paused while I was seraching for that word :P"
Crag says, "Three more episodes of Edo Rocket came out"
stormagnet says, "w00t!"
stormagnet says, "I was right- they batched them :)"
Crag says, "And Denno Coil 21"
stormagnet says, "SWEEEET"
Crag says, "AND"
Crag says, "Potemayo special 3!!!"
Crag says, "It's a holiday miracle"
stormagnet says, "YAY"
stormagnet says, "OH"
stormagnet says, "one more"
Crag says, "yesh?"
stormagnet says, "Episode three's title?"
stormagnet says, "that verb means 'to rain'"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "it's in the ukemi tense"
stormagnet says, "passive"
stormagnet says, "and when used by that, it means dumped/rejected"
stormagnet says, "So..."
stormagnet says, "gimmee a quick break, and then on to Denno?"
Crag nodsnods
Crag says, "I'm looking at the amazon music recommendations"
stormagnet says, "nice"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I keep marking stuff 'own it' and giving them ratings, and then that changes the recommendations such that when I go to the 'next' page, I see all the stuff on the last page that I didn't rate."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I wish I could say "no singles, no live albums" for recommendations"
Crag says, "I only want those to come up when I'm searching or browsing"
Crag says, "Also, when an album comes out in three versions (regular, explicit, and import w/ BONUS TRACKS), I wish they would treat that as one item with three 'colors' or something"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "I second that one heartily"
stormagnet returns
Crag says, "alright then"
Crag says, "Episode 9"
stormagnet nods

stormagnet says, "can you IMAGINE the chaos and mass panic if they actually let one of those Sachi's inside the SCHOOL?"
Crag nods
stormagnet says, "she needs to learn"
Crag says, "she's only 17, I guess"
stormagnet nods
Crag pffft!

Crag says, "um"
stormagnet says, "damn"

Crag says, "me too!"
Crag says, "I need more tea"

Crag says, "Aw!"
Crag says, "When will your hug pillow arrive?"

stormagnet idles: dreaming of warm fluffy things
Crag says, "Val's about to mail you"
Crag says, "doh"
Crag says, "In six hours I'll be at Ty's jamming"
Crag says, "Another thing about Amazon"
Crag says, "I don't know if it's a pattern in people's purchasing or preferences or something"
Crag says, "But just because I like one album from an artist doesn't mean I want everything they've ever done."
Crag says, "Though, removing singles, lives, and bestofs, and collapsing virtually identical records would make a lot of that less of a problem."
Crag says, "I also wish the recommendations wouldn't include items I already have on a wishlist"
Crag says, "OMG"
Crag says, "Baccano 13 is out!!!!eleventy-one"
Crag says, "Here's where Greg's been posting game stuff:"
Crag | http://www.nemesis-system.com/wild-talents/index.php
Crag says, "Greg's notes are way better than mine!"
Crag says, "Not surprisingly, his writing is as good as or better than his speaking"
Crag says, "er, sepach"
Crag says, "speach"
Crag idles: jam
[Idling at 1:59 P.M. on Sat, Nov 24: jam]
Crag just got back (1:12 am pacific)
Crag says, "Ended up going to see a show at the Croc with Ty and his aunt Gail"
Crag says, "Will fill you in tomorrow, but must sleep now!"
Crag idles: real life intrusion
[Idling at 1:13 A.M. on Sun, Nov 25: real life intrusion]
stormagnet says, "oh nice!"
stormagnet says, "I miss going to shows with you"
stormagnet says, "we should go to lots of shows while I'm home for xmas!"
stormagnet :)
stormagnet says, "I crashed out"
stormagnet says, "Around 4:30, I got too tired and full and sleepy"
stormagnet says, "I Maxed Out on the Culture Festival and came home"
stormagnet says, "slept for about 3 hours, and just now woke up again"
stormagnet says, "feeling bright and perky an rejuvenated"
stormagnet says, "I was looking at the history of alarms that I keep setting myself over and over, and have noticed that this is a *really* common pattern"
stormagnet says, "I think I should just start planning around it, as much as possible :)"
stormagnet says, "Crash around 4:30-5, sleep until around 8-8:30, stay up until about 3:30"
stormagnet says, "Ideally followed by sleeping until around 10:30-11, but that's not going to work most weekdays ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "But I can fine tune this"
stormagnet says, "what's important is that there was actually a very predictable, regular pattern to what seemed like a wildly irregular, unpredictable sleep schedule"
stormagnet says, "who knew?"
stormagnet says, "anyway, the festival is over now"
stormagnet says, "so now it's time for me to panic over all the homework I still haven't done >_<"
stormagnet says, "I'll be in need of a break by the time you wake up :)"
stormagnet says, "come to think of it, that late afternoon-early evening period was when I tended to fall asleep in the car the most, too"
stormagnet says, "iiiiiiinteresting"
stormagnet says, "I think I just cannot escape the fact that I need about 10 hours of sleep every day, but since the rest of the world won't let me be the night owl that I gravitate towards naturally, breaking things in half seems to work pretty well"
stormagnet says, "and now I know that if I have to have morning classes, I should avoid classes in the afternoon that are later than 4pm"
stormagnet says, "and knowing that this is the schedule I get sleepy on naturally lets me plan in advance re: medication, or if necessary, pre-emptive caffination :)"
stormagnet says, "oh my goodness"
stormagnet says, "I'm probably reading *way* too much into this, but"
stormagnet says, "that email from the scholarship peeps?"
stormagnet says, "they forgot o do the email in list or BCC form"
stormagnet says, "so all the addresses are visible"
stormagnet says, "but what really caught my eye about this is"
stormagnet says, "my address is way at the top"
stormagnet says, "like, if they are being shown in the order that they were typed in, it would have been one of the first they input"
stormagnet says, "and they're NOT in any kind of alphaberuic order"
stormagnet O_O;
stormagnet says, "er, alphaBETIC"
stormagnet crosses her fingers
stormagnet . o O ( c'mon, $2k!!! )
stormagnet says, "I'm amused at the addition of a narrator in El Cazador"
stormagnet says, "doubly so that the voice and narration style reminds me of the one in Potemayo"
stormagnet says, "and with that, I'm caught up on El Cazador"
stormagnet says, "viva la procrastination!"
stormagnet says, "brb"
stormagnet idles: procrastinatin' in the tub!
Crag wakes
Crag says, "I did NOT get enough sleep"
Crag says, "But if I go back to sleep now I will sleep through my alarm"
Crag says, "Sancho decided he couldn't wait for me to wake up because he's hungry NOW"
Crag says, "He made noise in the kitchen which I _think_ was pawing at the cabinet I keep the cat food in"
Crag says, "The show we went to was pretty weak."
Crag says, "The 'headliner' was a band led by Ty's friend Jesse"
Crag says, "Jesse's good and his keyboard guy Peter was alright"
Crag says, "But the drummer was merely adequate and the bass player was out of place."
Crag says, "Beyond that their style just wasn't to my taste"
Crag potty
Crag back
Crag says, "We have sooo much anime...."
Crag checks out new stormy pick
Crag says, "er, 'pic'"
Crag says, "Oh, that's a good one!"
Crag says, "It's over-exposed, but I like your expression and posture"
Crag says, "I tried to fix the over-exposure in the gimp, but my photo editing skills are too weak"
stormagnet returns, frsh from the bath!
stormagnet says, "yeah, I noticed that too"
Crag says, "Yay!"
stormagnet says, "I'm trying to fix it, but I don't know why it's doing that :/"
Crag says, "Maybe we can work on it together when you get home!"
Crag says, "I'm so relieved that you got your tickets"
stormagnet says, "but it does make my skin look better, which I'm not complaining about ;)"
stormagnet says, "yes!!"
Crag says, "Heh, yeah"
stormagnet says, "me too :)"
Crag says, "Did you read Greg's posts on project-nemesis?"
stormagnet says, "oops, no"
stormagnet says, "link?"
Crag says, "I've been re-reading them.  His logs are WAY better than mine."
Crag says, "Sure, jussec"
Crag | http://www.nemesis-system.com/wild-talents/6.html
Crag says, "His username is Xarei"
stormagnet peers
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag says, "The 'Nemesis' project is an adaption of the One Role Engine to a Lovecraftian universe"
Crag says, "But this site covers a bunch of other ORE stuff too"
stormagnet says, "coooool"
Crag says, "They're in league with the Unknown Armies guy too"
Crag says, "I think"
stormagnet says, "nice!"
stormagnet says, "that color coding world description is cool!"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "The book spends a lot of time on that"
Crag says, "It talks about the meaning of the four colors, their five levels, explaining GM color level choices and handling color changes."
Crag says, "And it's all in the context of comic books."
stormagnet nodnods!
stormagnet says, "I got that"
stormagnet says, "I like it a lot!"
Crag says, "sadly the book is out of print and impossible to get"
Crag says, "However, Nathan bought extra so I might be able to get one from him"
stormagnet says, "and I can see immediately why Cursed was so popukar :)"
Crag says, "yeah :)"
Crag says, "I think Greg's tweaks were sheer genius"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "he is a really, REALLY talented GM"
stormagnet says, "which is why I enjoyed those Vampire LARPs he used to put on so much :)"
Crag says, "I understand that a lot better now :)"

Crag says, "Have you downloaded Bacanno 13 yet?"
stormagnet says, "not yet :("
stormagnet says, "I thought the Denno I was downloading would be finished by now ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't downloaded them all, and had been forgetting to re-up as we were watching them"
Crag says, "You should also grab Edo Rocket 21-23"
stormagnet says, "but I have through 15 now :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "those are queued"
stormagnet says, "but I'm throttling my downloads to one at a time"
Crag says, "That's probably a good idea."
stormagnet says, "since it's prone to choking sometimes :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Alright then.  Dennou Coil 10?"

stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "eeeeeexcellent"
Crag says, "I was going to talk to Shea about Dennou Coil in particular"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "Because of wanting to run a game of it"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "SWEET"
Crag says, "the plan I have in mind is to finish the series, then see if I can find any fan sites which catalog the canon facts from the show"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "Then I'll make up the rest"
Crag says, "wow!"
Crag says, "She's gnarly!"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "WHOA"
Crag says, "sweet"
Crag says, "The kids need to learn to use the emergency stop button :)"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "I wish they had subbed it as killa-bug or kilobug or something"
Crag says, "kira just seems totally wrong to me :P"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "but"
stormagnet says, "kira means sparkle"
Crag says, "Hm"
stormagnet says, "I think they're deliberately overloading those three"
Crag says, "yeah, I wouldn't put it past 'em"
Crag says, "aw"
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag nods.
stormagnet :(
Crag says, "yummy!"

Crag says, "me too!"
Crag snuggles fiercely then dashes off!
Crag idles: Yar!
[Idling at 9:24 A.M. on Sun, Nov 25: Yar!]
Crag returns
Crag says, "We are all still alive"
Crag says, "And haven't really been in any serious danger at all."
Crag says, "We talked our way off the all-female pirate ship because Jim had reservations about engaging women in battle and the rest of us lost our resolve because we hadn't figured out our plan in advance."
Crag says, "I didn't take any notes because Greg's were so much better than mine"
Crag says, "Also, in this session I didn't have much to do until the very end"
Crag says, "After talking our way off that other ship we went back to the Demon's Eye to regroup"
Crag says, "As soon as were were aboard I asked everyone to declare their intentions"
Crag says, "I stated my own intentions as to increase my own security as much as possible, physically, financially and otherwise."
Crag says, "I stated that my end goal is to hole up in a sturdy fort blistering with cannons staffed by the most loyal and trustworthy people I could find."
Crag says, "Everyone else said they were looking for answers to the questions our circumstances raised"
Crag says, "I agreed that we were all the best leads any of us had on these problems so that's a good reason to stick together for now"
Crag says, "And I said the next thing we need to do was agree on a plan of some sort"
Crag says, "I said that we needed to exchange our bars of silver for something more liquid and some supplies, and that if we're going to go anywhere in the ship we needed a crew"
Crag says, "And I pointed out that if we're going to keep a crew we would need a way to feed and pay them, which probably means piracy of one form or another"
Crag says, "And I continued on to say that this seemed to present a problem for Jim"
Crag says, "Jim then explained that he's no happier about it than I, explaining that his actions are not entirely of his own choosing.  To demonstrate he tossed his sword overboard."
Crag says, "The significance of this was not immediately apparent, and he said that it would be back and that he can't get rid of his sword or hat.  He said they compel him to behave in certain ways."
Crag says, "I asked him whether his own beliefs were part of this compulsion, but he said he didn't know"
Crag says, "Next Azaka started leading the conversation towards the question of leadership.  Jim objected that leadership is irrelevant if we don't know what we're doing."
Crag says, "And then I noticed that his sword was back in its sheath."
Crag says, "Ignoring Jim's objection I nominated Azaka as captain.  Azaka immediately responded by nominating me."
Crag says, "Then Jim, clearly not comfortable with the very idea that we might have some kind of leadership, nominated Al"
Crag says, "Al was very confused by this."
Crag says, "Jim asked Al to either pick one of the current nominees to settle the tie, or to nominate Jim to put us in clear deadlock."
Crag says, "Al said the thought this was a meaningless debate and refused to take a stand."
Crag says, "So I changed my nomination to myself"
Crag says, "But Azaka's and my decision to make me captain had no effect on the question of what to do next"
Crag says, "At some point either Jim or Azaka proposed that we could support ourselves as privateers, to which I made annoyed noises because my experiences in the navy had made me blind to the distinction between privateer and pirate."
Crag says, "Jim seemed to think he would be alright privateering, though, so we proceeded to develop this plan further."
Crag says, "We decided we would pull into port in the morning, investigate news from Europe, aquire a letter of marque, restock the ship, hire sailors, skilled and otherwise, and proceed with our privateering venture with the primary goal of researching our predicament or whatever it is."
Crag says, "And we did so."
Crag says, "Azaka, Jim and Al went into town and I stayed with the ship."
Crag says, "So I ended up spending about two hours of game time just laughing and spectating"
Crag says, "Or maybe it was less, but it felt long."
Crag says, "anyway"
Crag says, "While pursuing their in-town objectives the party was followed by a non-descript gentleman."
Crag says, "After he followed them into several establishments Azaka confronted the man asking him what his business was."
Crag says, "He said he had been tasked with investigating a young blind man who is protected by a large man."
Crag says, "He thought that maybe Al was the young man he was looking for."
Crag says, "He asked Al if he had encountered a priest recently."
Crag says, "Al snorted and said "we sure did.""
Crag says, "The gentelman brightened up a little and explained that he is trying to track down this priest and that he'd be interested in whatever information they could give him."
Crag says, "Al filled him in on the story of the priest and the man was clearly disappointed that the priest had disappeared."
Crag says, "Then he fidgited a little, said that he knew this was a strange request, but since Al is his only lead in tracking down the priest, he'd like to join Al's group."
Crag pauses for non-game comment
Crag says, "I don't wish to alarm you, but I just examined a fresh poop of Marco's and I'm a little concerned"
Crag says, "It was a bit too liquid and a little too red for my tastes."
Crag . o O ( tastes... in poo?  ew )
Crag says, "He doesn't seem to be distressed otherwise"
Crag says, "So maybe it's nothing"
Crag says, "I might just be over-protective after the last scare"
Crag says, "anyway, we can talk about it more later."
Crag resumes game reporting
Crag says, "They decided to let this gentleman join our party.  As it turns out, his name is Father Benedicto, an inquisitor."
Crag says, "Played by Tetsuo :)"
Crag says, "At that point Al said he'd go back to the ship with the padre"
Crag says, "When Al and Benny (my name for him for now) showed up at the ship and Al introduced me I had to roll to keep from freaking out."
Crag says, "WHY DID YOU LET AN INQUISITOR JOIN US?!"
Crag says, "I was still sore from my time as a prisoner of Spain, not to mention my last encounter with a priest."
Crag says, "Al filled me in on the details and eventually I calmed down."
Crag says, "Azaka and Jim continued their business in town including stopping at a pub, where Az gave a bar wench some money and asked her to spread the word that he would be at the pub tomorrow recruiting for adventures, and in particular that he welcomes women, colored folk and christians.  And under his breath he muttered "but no frenchies""
Crag says, "While at the pub they spotted a man they recognized from when they initially came to in the brig of the Demon's Eye several weeks ago."
Crag says, "It was one of Captain Morgain's men, drinking himself silly"
Crag says, "They chatted him up and recruited him."
Crag says, "His name was Erol something"
Crag says, "So when Az, Jim and Erol showed up at the ship and Erol commented that the ship looked to be a little beat up, I immediately grew suspicious"
Crag says, "Then they told him it was in worse shape when we found it and that it seemed to repair itself"
Crag says, "And he said yeah, it does that."
Crag says, "I said, "Who is this man who is chummy with the Demon's Eye?""
Crag says, "And they introduced me"
Crag says, "ANd I rolled to keep from freaking out again"
Crag says, "Erol had knocked me out with a blow to the head when I was initially captured, and I knew it."
Crag says, "WHAT IS WITH YOU PEOPLE?!"
Crag says, "WHy are you bringing Inquisitors and Captain Morgains own men amongst us?!"
Crag says, "Oh, it's OK, they said, he doesn't like Henry Morgain anymore.  The captain abandoned him in a difficult situation and now he wants revenge."
Crag says, "I rolled my eyes, threw my hands in the air and stomped off"
Crag says, "Oh yes, another thing that happened before they came back"
Crag says, "Al slowly climbed the rigging, by himself, and got into the crowsnest of the mast on which the eye of the ship is mounted."
Crag says, "He poked at the eye a little and it responded noticably"
Crag says, "He touched the tail of the eye and it tried to hit him in the head, but he blocked it."
Crag says, "But it didn't do anything else, so he sat down and meditated"
Crag says, "When Erol came aboard he asked if anyone had looked through the eye yet."
Crag says, "We asked him what he was talking about, but he didn't elaborate"
Crag says, "Jim had overheard him from up above, however, and decided to experiment some more."
Crag says, "He grabbed hold of the tail of the eye, and it POPPED OUT HIS LEFT EYE AND INSERTED ITSELF INTO THE SOCKET"
Crag says, "Jim had joined him in the crow's nest but was remarkably unperterbed by this development."
Crag says, "Al did not cry out, however, as he was experiencing the view from the ship's eye at this point"
Crag says, "He quickly discovered that the eye could see not only Very Freaking Far, but even forward into time."
Crag says, "On his first viewing he saw time speed up in the view and was also able to restore time back to the present"
Crag says, "He was also able to see a strange white-ish light area far off which drew his attention"
Crag says, "He focused on this and his view soared over to this area which turned out to be clouds or fog with an island similiar to the one we had escaped, with its own zigurat."
Crag says, "More interestingly, he saw the five of us (including Father Benedicto) mounting the steps of the ziggurat.  Jim appeared taller and Azaka appeared to be glowing."
Crag says, "He separated himself from the eye by pulling its tail out of his head *slurp*, and then hollared down below asking where Jim was"
Crag says, "Someone replied that he had gone ashore for some pre-departure carousing"
Crag says, "He contacted Jim telepathicaly only to discover that Jim was busy with one of the local whores"
Crag says, "Only slightly put off, he told Jim about what he'd seen and said he'd like to talk about it more later.  Jim ignored him as best he could, trying to enjoy his evening."
Crag says, "The first time Al had looked through the eye, the removal of his own eye had done the kind of damage to his head which, if repeated, would surely kill him."
Crag says, "But for some reason this did not prevent him from looking through the eye again"
Crag says, "It did no new damage, so he was fine in that sense"
Crag says, "In this viewing session he experimented a bit to try to determine the limits and capabilities of the eye"
Crag says, "He found he could only look in the directions which would be considered 'forward' of the ship, both spatially and temporally."
Crag says, "However he was able to concentrate on a subject and zoom to it."
Crag says, "With the intent to see the female pirate captain (whose name we know but I've forgotten), his view raced over the sea to some islands, into a cave where some pillars were decorated as women with three faces each."
Crag says, "Just as his vision came up to the pillars it was rebounded by something and the ship's eye reverberated, kicking him off the eyestalk"
Crag says, "Father Bendicto had joined him in the Crow's Nest and asked him about his experiences, which he related."
Crag says, "Some time after resting from all that Al came down for the night."
Crag says, "Nothing else happened that night."
Crag says, "THe next morning Al, Jim, Azaka and I went into town."
Crag says, "I bought myself some clothes more fitting a ship's captain and I acquired a month's worth of supplies for a ship staffed with 50 people."
Crag tea break
Crag says, "We're going over to John and Marti's at 2pm on the 24th, by the way."
Crag says, "Val and Cathy will be there too. :)"
Crag says, "And presumably Barb, of course."
Crag says, "so, back to the story"
Crag says, "While I was stocking myself and the ship, Az, Jim and Al interviewed volunteers"
Crag says, "Az asked what people's abilities were, Jim asked what their goals were, and Al read their minds"
Crag says, "Oh, the first interviewee was the wench Az had asked to spread the word"
Crag says, "For her abilities she said she could sew, but that she refused to be a whore."
Crag says, "When Jim asked her what her goals are she said she wanted to get out of whoring."
Crag says, "Al had no trouble reading her mind and said she was hiding nothing."
Crag says, "So she was the first recruit :)"
Crag says, "They hired another 19 of the best candidates and came back to the ship with them."
Crag says, "After they came back we had a meeting of me, Al, Az, Jim and Erol."
Crag says, "The subject of the meeting was ship's rules and how to divide shares of riches"
Crag says, "Jim rather strongly suggested that rather than give the captain extra shares, that all the officers should get equal shares."
Crag says, "I sortof scowled at him, and proposed that this arrangement needed a sunset clause"
Crag says, "Jim said we'd just keep this arrangement for the first voyage and that the next time we came into a port where someone could safely pursue other business that the terms would be up for negotiation again."
Crag says, "That proposal was enough for me so I agreed"
Crag says, "Erol found these terms strange but clearly working in his favor"
Crag says, "Oh yes, before we'd talked about shares we worked out the stations of the officers"
Crag says, "I remained captain from our previous election, Azaka was named first mate, Erol became second mate, we assigned Jim as security officer and as the only person willing to stick a supernatural eyestalk in his head, Al was the obvious choice for navigator."
Crag says, "Then we decided on the shares as described above."
Crag says, "Next Az rounded up the rest of the crew so they could meet the officers and agree to the rules of the ship and terms of employment."
Crag says, "We gathered above decks.  Az introduced me as captain, and so on.  There was some obvious concern when Az introduced Al (still with blindfold on) as the navigator.  But nobody objected and everyone signed their contracts in whatever way they knew how."
Crag says, "With all of that settled we weighed anchor and departed."
Crag says, "Earlier (before we had come in to town) we decided to staff the ship with 20 experienced crew and 30 freed slaves."
Crag says, "The idea was that this would benefit us by giving us a full complement of sailors without paying the full price, and would have obvious benefits for the slaves."
Crag says, "So I asked Al to go back up to the eye and see if he could find a plantation of a suitable size and location for our plans."
Crag says, "He couldn't see anything helpful until we got the ship pointed in the right direction, but then he found a good candidate."
Crag says, "As luck would have it there was a very small town with a passable dock for us to anchor at in preparation for our raid.  While we were docked, Al surveyed the target coffee plantation and determined that there were about 30 slaves and four fighting men.  He tried looking into the near future but saw nothing about our plans.  We took this to indicate that the fates were either unaware or unconcerned with what we had in mind."
Crag says, "We decided that Az, Jim and I would make the best team for this plan.  I put Erol in charge of the ship and Al hung out in the crow's nest where he could watch our progress and possibly contact us telepathically if he saw anything we needed to know about."
Crag says, "We attacked in broad daylight figuring we had enough of an advantage of surprise and strength that attacking at night would be of no additional value."
Crag says, "First Az walked right out into the part of the coffee forest where two fighting men on horseback were watching the slaves work."
Crag says, "He told them he had a message for them and tried to keep them focused on him while Jim and I ran around behind them"
Crag says, "Az's attempt at distraction was not very successful, but it was good enough.  Jim and I did get in the first attacks on our respective quaries."
Crag says, "Neither of us were hurt in this part of the raid.  Az helped Jim with his man and I took mine down with ease."
Crag says, "As we were fighting a third man leaned out of a window of the plantation house (what do you call those?  not just a house but... something else?)"
Crag says, "The man took a shot at Jim and hit him non-critically in the side."
Crag says, "Az and I jumped on the horses of the men we'd already knocked out.  Az went through the front door of the house and I ran around back.  Jim ran up to the side of the house under the window the man had leaned out and scaled the trellis."
Crag says, "The plantation owner and his wife had just come in from the back wondering what was going on as Az came into their house, on horseback, bearing down on them."
Crag says, "It was a nightmarish sight for them.  A well-dressed haitian on one of their own horses, carrying a blunderbuss he'd taken from one of their guards, coming at them down the hall."
Crag says, "So they tried to run out the back door."
Crag says, "The lady of the house was able to run a little faster than her husband, who was rather round and out of shape."
Crag says, "I overtook the man and (with a rather nice roll I might add) picked the owner up and hoisted him over my head."
Crag says, "Next I threw him at his wife (with another good roll!) knocking them both out but not doing any serious harm to either of them."
Crag says, "While all this was going on Jim had scaled the trellis.  The man inside had just finished reloading his blunderbuss as Jim got to the window."
Crag says, "The man tried to fire at Jim but Jim was too quick with his sword and knocked the man's gun up as it fired, again avoiding harm.  He easily knocked the man out with his next blow."
Crag says, "With all the white people knocked out Azaka gathered the slaves together outside."
Crag says, "He told the slaves who had been cooperating with their masters to go tend to their master's wounds now."
Crag says, "To the rest of the slaves he explained that he had a ship he is staffing for adventures and anyone who wishes to join should grab as much of value from the house that they can and follow us to the ship."
Crag says, "Someone asked why joining him on his ship would be any different from their lives on the plantation"
Crag says, "He said they would be paid and free to leave any time they were at port... or at sea, for that matter (and then he chuckled)."
Crag says, "Someone asked about their families.  Azaka said they were all welcome: elders, friends, siblings, children."
Crag says, "There was some murmering and then pretty much everyone one of them descended on the house to loot it."
Crag says, "Greg said it reminded Azaka of when he'd seen piranah devour a cow that had fallen in the wrong river."
Crag says, "So we headed back to the ship and that was the end of the session. :)"
Crag pets a marco now
stormagnet wakes!
stormagnet says, "I forgot to set my alarm ^_^;;"
stormagnet [:reads scroll
stormagnet says, "Nice session!"
stormagnet says, "you're going to have a very interesting crew :)"
stormagnet says, "I'm glad that you were paying close enough attention to Marco to catch that"
stormagnet says, "I don't think it's likely to be too serious"
stormagnet says, "Marco has a known predilicion for Eating Things He Probably Shouldn't, and has had reactions like that before"
stormagnet says, "but it might be a good idea to make sure he gets lots and lots of extra, clean water"
stormagnet says, "and keep him the hell away from dry food :)"
stormagnet says, "so basically, business as usual, but a little more stringent, or something"
stormagnet says, "if it happens again, though, it might be good to go stock up on some more baby food at Safeway :)"
Crag says, "I'm here"
Crag says, "was in another window"
Crag says, "I haven't fed them any dry food at all since you left"
Crag says, "I'll definitely keep an eye out"
Crag says, "I'm not _too_ worried because his personality doesn't seem to have changed"
Crag says, "He's still pushy, still harassing Sancho, etc."
Crag makes more tea
Crag . o O ( I wonder if I should email her phone to let her know I didn't crash )
stormagnet says, "I'm here!"
stormagnet says, "I wandered afk for a sec"
Crag heh
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "whew!"
Crag says, "I would have emailed your phone before going to bed"
Crag says, "But now that you're here we can chat it up!"
stormagnet says, "yeah, I'm almost certain that he just managed to get into something he shouldn't"
stormagnet says, "yay!!"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I'd like to keep him from getting into whatever he got into if I knew what it was"
Crag says, "oh well"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I wouldn't worry about it too much"
Crag says, "I'll try not to :/"
stormagnet says, "if it continues, than we can try quaratining, but I don;t think that'll be necessary"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "I'm so glad he got better"
Crag says, "Me too"
stormagnet says, "I was really really scared"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I know"
stormagnet says, "I'm so relieved that you're loving on them and giving them both plenty of attention"
Crag says, "hee"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "They don't really give me any choice :)"
Crag says, "And I don't mind"
stormagnet laughs!!
Crag says, "So anyway"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yes, game was pretty good"
stormagnet says, "I am amused at the twist with Tetsuo"
Crag says, "I'm pleased that the leadership question has been at least partly answered"
stormagnet says, "I suspect that Greg is, in fact, working Church politics into this arc"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'm sure that's the case"
stormagnet says, "congratulations, by the way!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Thank you, I think :)"
Crag says, "I suspect being captain will make me a target"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "of course"
stormagnet says, "but it suits your character perfectly"
Crag says, "And said as much in game as well, intending it to be a reason why I should be captain"
stormagnet says, "and please note:"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "Greg and Shannon's styles are VERY different"
Crag says, "I've noticed!"
stormagnet says, "in thgat Greg almost never lets his characters die"
stormagnet says, "as well as other points"
stormagnet says, "they're both good GMs, but run very different campaigns"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Greg is like the new testament God to Shannon's old testament God"
stormagnet says, "so, savour being a target"
stormagnet says, "it'll make things interesting"
Crag says, "Edward will love being a target"
stormagnet says, "YES"
stormagnet says, "you should tell him that"
stormagnet says, "he will crack up so hard"
Crag says, "I will :)"
Crag says, "I think we all have fairly clear pictures of each other"
stormagnet says, "pry Shannon, too, for that matter :)"
Crag says, "And Greg moreso"
stormagnet nods!
Crag laughs
Crag says, "That's true"
Crag says, "I should post a link to the nemesis site for Shannon to check out our stuff"
stormagnet says, "YES!"
Crag says, "I'm sure he'd enjoy Greg's notes"
stormagnet says, "totally"
Crag says, "I'll do that tonight"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "That would be in the go bots suck room I suppose"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "and you can X him, as well"
Crag says, "I might at that"
Crag says, "We've all been pretty open both in charachter and out"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Except for Shea who is playing up the mystery of his character"
Crag says, "Tetsuo didn't have much of a chance to reveal himself this session"
Crag says, "Since it took us HOURS to get off the freaking boat"
Crag says, "That was driving me nuts :)"
Crag says, "Both Robert and Edward were getting irritated :)"
Crag says, "Edward is frustrated with the naivete and unprofessionalism of his coleagues"
Crag says, "Mostly Jim, actually"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "I had guessed that might be an issue"
stormagnet says, "this is VERY unconventional"
Crag says, "Which part? :)"
stormagnet says, "and Ed is pretty conventional"
Crag says, "Oh that, yeah"
Crag says, "That's been hard on him too"
stormagnet says, "for a start, allowing wimmens as cast members"
Crag says, "yes"
stormagnet says, "though the female pirates may have primed him for that"
Crag says, "Well"
stormagnet says, "by sailor superstition, that curses a ship"
Crag says, "He still hasn't admitted that this is real"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I like that tack"
Crag says, "There are so many things wrong from his point of view"
stormagnet says, "the sort of throwing up your hands thing"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "but it would definitely make him uncomfortable"
Crag says, "But Greg pointed out that this is the first dream Ed has had in which he slept and dreampt :)"
stormagnet says, "but now that he's captain officially, despite having resisted a bit"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think he may confront this reality next session"
stormagnet says, "he might start having to come down to earth"
Crag says, "Exactly"
stormagnet says, "and might want to impose some order"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think I'm going to talk to the priest about it"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "good idea"
stormagnet says, "amusing one, too"
Crag says, "Even though he's a damn'd Spaniard!"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I think Ed may cling to the religion he rejected to protect him from the 'blueness' of this world"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "I kind of thought he might"
Crag says, "Like, if I have to accept fantasy it might as well be the one I sorta know"
stormagnet says, "he;s going to have to find a way to reconcile it"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Exactly"
stormagnet says, "he might just decide that it's the Apocalypse"
Crag says, "well yeah, there is that"
Crag says, "He may also conclude that he too has gone crazy like the captain he led a mutiny against"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But he might just get over it"
stormagnet says, "he would've been raised, as everyoine was, to believe that it was right around the corner"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "that's true."
stormagnet says, "Not 'freaked out' Apocalypse"
stormagnet says, "but, "Everything's gone weird because God decided to turn it all upside-down""
Crag nods.
stormagnet says, "but he's likely to start having the sort of moral qualms that Jim and Al have in that case"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "that would suck"
stormagnet says, "and since, as every good Englishman would know, God is on England's side"
stormagnet says, "being a privateer might be a chance to get back on God's good side"
stormagnet says, "even though he'd basically given up on that, this weirdness might make it more real to him"
Crag says, "If he buys into Christianity, I could definitely see him going that way"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "And"
Crag says, "He's into the loyal follower thing"
Crag says, "So he might choose God as his new captain"
stormagnet says, "he might not have been very devout before, but this is likely going to sway him"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Which would be ... interesting"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "you can always ask Greg for advice :)"
Crag says, "He's going to be vulnerable talking to Father Benedicto"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "I want to avoid asking Greg for advice 'cause I don't want to be a burden on him :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I want to be a Good Player so he invites me to more games!"
stormagnet says, "but if you're not pushy about it"
Crag . o O ( best. gm. EVAR. )
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "and you can always ask if it would be ok to ask"
stormagnet says, "like, if he's not too busy"
Crag says, "If I get desperate I may"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I might also just talk it out with Shea"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "but there's another funny thing"
stormagnet says, "also, Ben's gamed with Greg a LOT"
Crag says, "Father Benedicto is already feeling almost as weirded out as Ed"
stormagnet says, "so you can ask him what Greg's attitude towards that sort of motivation-coaching is"
Crag says, "Because he's on a ship called The Demon's Eye, and he watched Al use the eye"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "yeah, you think?"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
Crag says, "That's a good point too"
stormagnet says, "it sees the future"
stormagnet says, "there's definitely some kind of a dogma point there"
Crag nods.
Crag says, "The first thing the padre did when he came aboard was bless a barrel of water"
stormagnet says, "Who knows, maybe they'll change the name :P"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "When he was done with that he tried to use it to bless the ship"
Crag says, "Nothing happened :)"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "take it as a good sign"
Crag says, "We presume the ship is absolved of its sins... for now."
Crag says, "I do"
stormagnet says, "if it were possesssed, all hell would have broken loose"
Crag says, "I was expecting trouble"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "according to exiorcism cannon, anyway"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "so"
stormagnet says, "maybe it's a misnomer"
Crag says, "It may be a neutral entity"
Crag says, "that could be"
stormagnet says, "maybe it's a glance through the eye of God"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "maybe this is a Mission from God"
Crag laughs
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Blues Brothers style :)"
stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "What's funny is that I could see Ed and the priest sortof teaming up as the Sane Ones or something."
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but, on the other hand"
stormagnet says, "Al seems to have some insight into the whole angle"
stormagnet says, "having used the eye"
Crag says, "That's true"
stormagnet says, "and having been blessed/cursed/whatever by God in an unusually emphatic way"
Crag says, "At this point Al is basically made out of pure insight :)"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh, there's some meta-game info you may be amused by"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Since this session didn't end on a cliffhanger, James spent most of his saved up XP today"
stormagnet says, "whoring?"
Crag says, "He had planned to buy off his curse, but his interactions with the ship in-game changed his character concept"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "good!"
stormagnet says, "that would've been a waste"
Crag says, "He spent all his points improving his perceptions and concentration"
Crag says, "He put no energy into destructive capability (his original intent) or removing his curse"
Crag says, "So now he's a REALLY GOOD LOOKOUT"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "And he's still crippled"
stormagnet says, "which teams up well with Al"
Crag says, "In fact, it's even worse because one of his eyes is actually gone"
stormagnet says, "the crippled walk and the blind see?"
Crag says, "Hm?"
stormagnet grins wickedly
Crag says, "By James I meant RL James, not Ben's character Jim"
Crag says, "James is Al"
stormagnet says, "ah!"
stormagnet says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "but yes"
stormagnet says, "all the same"
Crag says, "Oh, one other thing I just remembered"
stormagnet says, "it takes on serious prophetic/biblical overtones in the right light"
stormagnet says, "which is, of course, the light Al's seeing it in"
Crag says, "James told Greg that he intended to keep the functionality of his remaining eye a secret in general"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "James said that if anyone doubts his blindness he will raise just the left side of his blindfold to show them the empty socket"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "nice"
Crag says, "Yeah, I liked that a lot :)"
Crag says, "I'm very impressed with James's gaming"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "he's GOOD"
stormagnet says, "and not showboaty"
Crag says, "Yes"
stormagnet says, "works well with any type of system or group"
stormagnet says, "he's in pretty much ALL of Greg's games, I think"
Crag says, "I knew virtually nothing about him before, so I had no expectations at all"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Ben's been on pretty good behavior"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He caught himself arguing rules and called himself on it"
stormagnet says, "they all work together well"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "nice!"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "So far I think Tetsuo's going to ease into the group without any problem, too"
Crag says, "His character will be very uncomfortable though :)"
Crag says, "I think it's a great role for him"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "He's always seemed to enjoy playing slightly obsessive characters"
stormagnet says, "he plays uncomfortable brilliantly"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Yeah, that too"
stormagnet says, "precisely"
stormagnet says, "it's perfect casting"
Crag says, "yep!"
stormagnet says, "I wonder if Greg would let me come spectate while I'm in town"
Crag says, "The only Sunday you'll be here is the 23rd.  There might be holiday interference"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "true..."
Crag says, "But if we have game I suspect you'd be welcome"
Crag says, "You'd have to get down the stairs though"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "As well as up them"
stormagnet says, "hmmm... yeah"
Crag says, "it would be a big hassle for you"
stormagnet says, "if I came through the back, there'd be less"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I was mostly thinking of the basement stairs"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "but then there's two sets"
stormagnet says, "into the house"
stormagnet says, "then down"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "if I went through the back, it would pry be simpler"
stormagnet says, "I could bring a couple plastic safeway bags and butt scoot"
Crag says, "Oh, does the basement door to the outside open?"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'd never seen it used"
Crag says, "I kinda assumed it was non-functional :P"
stormagnet says, "I'm pretty sure it's useable, but not popular"
stormagnet says, "I gather there's spiders and such"
Crag says, "You could probably come in that way then"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I'll bring it up with Greg next session if I remember"
stormagnet cheers!
Crag says, "there were some other details I left out of my retelling"
Crag says, "Not necessarily interesting ones"
Crag says, "But there was role-playing for all the business the others did in town on that first day"
Crag says, "Exchanging most of the silver for other money, getting the (counterfeit) letter of marque, etc"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "the paperwork"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "Yeah"
Crag says, "Which reminds me"
Crag says, "Next session I need to meet with the officers and make sure we get our stories straight"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "definitely"
Crag says, "For example, how did we come to take over the Demon's Eye?"
Crag says, "Also, what is the deal with the composition of our crew?"
Crag says, "I am fully anticipating that our rescue operation will come back to bite us"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "especially as you're privateers, now"
Crag says, "exactly"
stormagnet says, "who's turf was that plantation on?"
stormagnet says, "if French, you're good"
Crag says, "French"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "that's who you're *supposed* to be robbing, if I recall"
Crag says, "Yeah"
stormagnet says, "so then again, maybe not"
Crag says, ""True"
Crag says, "It could work in our favor"
stormagnet says, "the English didn't really get into slaving in the way the French, Spanish and Americans did"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "So..."
Crag says, "You want to watch something before I crash?"
stormagnet says, "yes!!"
stormagnet says, "you betcher ass!!"
Crag grins
stormagnet says, "all my downloads are done!"
stormagnet says, "we can watch the Baccano!!"
Crag says, "zomg!"
Crag says, "I hope I can follow it"
Crag says, "I'm a little out of it"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I think I'm having a long-delayed hangover"
stormagnet says, "oh dear"
stormagnet says, "I'm a grab a soda real quick before we start"
Crag says, "ok"
Crag says, "I have to move files around and stuff anyway"
stormagnet says, "you should drink some water and have some salt"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I had some Emergen-C"
stormagnet says, "excellent"
stormagnet says, "later, if your stomach is up for it, I recommend something mild and starchy along with some Ibuprofin"

stormagnet NODS
Crag says, "That's encouraging :)"
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "So why would that one chick fall for that Rail Tracer guy?"
Crag says, "She'd only just met him right?"
stormagnet says, "there are, from the look of it, MANY more adventures with this cast of characters"
stormagnet says, "looks like"
stormagnet says, "and more of those books are coming out"
Crag says, "so... did he just happen to push all the right buttons or what?"
Crag says, "I don't get it :)"
stormagnet says, "that chick was.... odd"
stormagnet says, "I don't think it took much"
stormagnet says, "but remember"
stormagnet says, "she has that psychic power to read intentions"
Crag says, "oh... I had forgotten about that"
stormagnet says, "so she must have been able to tell that the crazy shit he was saying, he 100% meant"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And that impressed her, heh"
stormagnet says, "and he could understand her, even though she's mute"
Crag says, "oh well, I might fall for that too"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "and they seem like they may be the same alignment"
Crag says, "good point"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "I'm really, really looking forward to reading those books :)"
stormagnet says, "I should buy lots of books to bring home while I'm here"
stormagnet says, "it's the best practice of all"
Crag says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "my vocabulary has been growing really fast from all the games and manga and anime and tv"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "And class?"
stormagnet says, "not as much ^_^;"
Crag says, "wow"
stormagnet says, "but helpful"
stormagnet says, "I kind of expected that, though"
stormagnet says, "the real learning comes from Just Being Here"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "the class is useful, but is really more of an excuse"
stormagnet says, "and not everyone is like me"
stormagnet says, "most aren't"
stormagnet says, "most of my classmates only watch the English language tv channels"
stormagnet says, "while I haven't been watching them at all"
stormagnet says, "and don;t seem to be reading much, either"
stormagnet says, "it's a matter of perspective, or something"
Crag says, "I like yours :)"
stormagnet says, "and also, I pick things up faster- so the rate at which I pick things up under formal instruction isn't much different than the rate I do without"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "aw"
Crag hrms
stormagnet says, "?"
stormagnet grins expectantly
Crag says, "A subber released some Denno Coil with a tag of RonPaul2008"

Crag says, "Everyone was on time for a change"

Crag says, "It raised more questions than it answered, too"
stormagnet says, "it was really funny"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "I'm guessing the Shinto tie in is going to get deeper from here on"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "remember, Shinto is animist"
Crag says, "That's where everything has a spirit right?"
stormagnet nods
Crag . o O ( I'm learnding! )

Crag says, "Well"

Crag says, "All of the social and historical stuff"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "I can do the mechanics and technological stuff"
Crag says, "But the context is still pretty alien to me"

stormagnet says, "I thought Machiko was going to come over tonight, but either she's pretty late, or I'm misremembering"
stormagnet says, "maybe it was tomorrow..."
stormagnet says, "ehn"
Crag says, "I may be home late.  I've got a terrible knot in my shoulder and I'm thinking I might see if I can get a massage."
stormagnet says, "that sounds nice....."
stormagnet says, "the massage, not the knot >_<"
stormagnet says, "I'll be out running errands anyway, so take your time ^_^"
stormagnet says, "man...."
stormagnet says, "there's a lot of massage places around here, and they seem a lot cheaper than in Seattle..."

stormagnet says, "I think I might have left some of those sticky heat patches behind in the bathroom cabinet"
stormagnet says, "I reccommend using one- if there aren't any there, go get some on your way to work"
stormagnet says, "in the absence of massage as an option, heat is the next best thing"
stormagnet says, "especially when it's cold out, which just makes it knot up tighter"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry I wasn't on sooner"
stormagnet says, "I killed my putty in an attempt to keep myself from getting disatracted, since I can no longer get away with putting off this essay >_<"
stormagnet says, "but I need to take a break now, or my head will explode"
stormagnet says, "besides, from the few classmates I ran into during the Mita-Sai, I have a growing suspicion that most of the class *forgot* that we have this massive essay to write during this break"
stormagnet says, "I kept asking them what they had chosen for their topic, and they talked about essays in *other classes* we were taking together"
stormagnet says, "where *all we had to choose* was a topic"

Crag says, "Besides visiting you, I think for my birthday I want a fancy chair"
Crag says, "like a recliner or something, possibly with built-in massage features."
Crag says, "And if you're wondering where that thought came from, it came from me leafing through the Brookstone catalog that somehow found me at the apartment."
Crag . o O ( toys for boys who have jobs )

AZAKA: Why exactly are you following us?

MAN: (Clasping his hands together as if in prayer) My apologies I did not mean offense, I was interested in that blind young man.

AZAKA: Are you a priest?

MAN: Yes, I am, and I am looking for other priests. I had heard that you had seen one. A Spanish monk.

AZAKA: Check him for gardening tools.

They explained to the priest their previous encounter, and he explained that the other priest was of the Carthusian order known for their solitary life and habit of growing all of their own food.

JIM: So, then what order are you?

PRIEST: Inquisitore.

(All players wince sharply)

AL: Are you going to have a problem with our ship?

PRIEST: Some of my brethren are less lenient than I. A fact for which I have been disciplined.

AL: Ill put it this way, can you suffer a witch to live?

PRIEST: No.

AL: How are you at ignoring stuff?

Crag | http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/11/28/interesting/

Crag says, "Oh!"
Crag says, "I see now"
Crag says, "I was looking at the wrong picturz"
Crag says, "Yay kotatsu!"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Your pictures come in so many different sizes"
Crag says, "I keep seeing the Hairy Potter book in your pictures"
Crag says, "I still haven't read it yet"
Crag heh
stormagnet says, "I still haven't either"
stormagnet ^_^;;
Crag says, "wow, you must be really busy over there!"
stormagnet says, "I'm worried that if I start, I won't be able to stop"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet :(
stormagnet says, "all I do is study and sleep, it seems like"
stormagnet says, "and watch anime with you :)"
stormagnet says, "but that's about as far as my recreation goes :/"
Crag says, "Are you ever going to have time for tutoring?"
stormagnet says, "honestly, I worry about that"
stormagnet says, "what's worse, it turns out that the office I need to submit that paper work to is NOT the city office"
stormagnet says, "but some other place I have a) never been and b) several train stations away"
stormagnet says, "goddammit"
Crag pouts
Crag says, "At least you don't really need to worry about the money right now"
Crag says, "But I'd feel better if you were meeting more people and stuff"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "me too ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "but I'm still planning to have that nabe party, so that's a start :)"
Crag says, "Excellent"
Crag says, "I've got to head off to work soon"
stormagnet says, "and maybe I can get the profs to divulge a bit more of what our post-break assignments will be, so I can get a head start"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet says, "have a good day!"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag hugs!
stormagnet hugs!
Crag says, "I'll check in from work so maybe we can chat more before you go to sleep :)"
Crag says, "But take care of yourself!"
Crag says, "Don't make yourself sick or anything"
Crag says, "keep warm and comfy, eat well, get all your salts and stuff"
Crag says, "I still worry about you"
Crag says, "And now I'm going idle for about 40 minutes for the walk to work.  whee."
Crag idles: trip trap, trip trap
[Idling at 8:05 A.M. on Wed, Nov 28: trip trap, trip trap]
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "I made myself a proper dinner"
stormagnet says, "AND"
stormagnet says, "I got a bento box!"
stormagnet says, "finally"
stormagnet says, "so I'm going to start taking lunches to school!"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "I could take pictures of my bentos, too"
stormagnet says, "and send them"
stormagnet says, "that'll give me extra motivation to make them extra cute"
stormagnet says, "since I can't make you aisai bento"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag wakes
Crag says, "Almost forgot to check the MOO when I got to work"
Crag says, "yay taking lunches to school!"
stormagnet says, "oh noes!"
Crag says, "Yes, you should send me pictures of your bentos"
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet giggles
stormagnet says, "I can send you a pic of my dinner, too"
Crag says, "Is is appropriate to apply english pluralizing to japanese words?"
stormagnet says, "though it's nothing special"
Crag says, "What's the plural of bento in japanese?"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "not really"
stormagnet says, "but so common that everyone does it"
Crag says, "Still"
Crag says, "I use latin rules to pluralize words I assume to be latin"
stormagnet says, "and ever since the LolCat trend of adding random pluralization, I have ceased to mind"
stormagnet says, "it just makes it sound cute to me now"
stormagnet ^_^;
Crag laughs
Crag says, "peace and harmony through lolcats!"
stormagnet grins
stormagnet says, "YES!"
stormagnet says, "LOLCATS FOR WORL PEACE!"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "I picked up some Love Monster from Amazon"
Crag says, "Which one is that?"
stormagnet says, "a manga series I love muchly, but that started to get really hard to find scanslations of"
Crag says, "Ah, one I don't know then :)"
stormagnet says, "I tried to get you to read it, but you weren't really into it"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "it's the monster school, with the ecchi bits ^_^"
Crag says, "Manga is really hard for me to process"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Oh, I kinda remember that"
Crag says, "The guy in the tower and all"
stormagnet says, "I'm pleased to find that it's really easy reading ^_^"
stormagnet NODS
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "that one!"
Crag says, "I'm sure I would like it as an anime"
stormagnet is surprised you remember!
stormagnet nods!!
Crag says, "heh, yay me!"
stormagnet says, "oooooh0 that would rock!"
stormagnet says, "it's very Hard Core rainecrack"
Crag grins
stormagnet ^^
Crag says, "but there are so many kinds of hard core rainecrack"
Crag says, "How can you rank them?"
stormagnet says, "yes, but this has nearly all of them combined!"
Crag says, "Ahh"
stormagnet says, "it just keeps getting better, too"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "this is pry better for me that a night out clubbing, anyway"
stormagnet says, "in terms of recreation"
Crag laughs
stormagnet says, "it's cheaper, and good studying"
stormagnet says, "...."
Crag says, "I agree with that evaluation"
stormagnet says, "but I do feel like a total hikikomori ^_^;;"
Crag says, "Your situation is a little unusual"
stormagnet says, "but, it's more like I'm kikikomorase"
stormagnet says, "right"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of forced into it"
Crag says, "yeah, I was trying to think of a nicer way of putting it"
Crag says, "but there isn't one"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
stormagnet sighs
Crag hugs!
stormagnet says, "but I'll enjiy it as much as I can"
stormagnet hugs!!
stormagnet says, "and I'll keep looking forward to spring"
Crag says, "Yeah!"
stormagnet says, "I can do all the outside-of-my-apartment stuff with you ^_^"
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag says, "I'm looking forward to it"
stormagnet says, "It's hard to remember to think of things as "things I can't do *right now*"
Crag says, "Did you see the mail from your mom about the 24th?"
stormagnet says, "instead of Things I Can't Do"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "She sent it to your UW account"
stormagnet says, "I mentioned it briefly in the MOO"
Crag says, "Will you be bringing both chairs back?"
stormagnet says, "but I didn't give specifics, since I figured you would have heard already"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "ok, I'll reply later than"
stormagnet says, "OH!"
stormagnet says, "and!"
Crag says, "Er, then"
Crag says, "yes?"
stormagnet says, "I told her already :)"
stormagnet says, "BUT"
Crag says, "oh, ok :)"
stormagnet says, "my disability thing?"
Crag says, "Yeah?"
stormagnet says, "I get a discount"
stormagnet says, "on buying chairs here"
Crag says, "Oh!"
stormagnet says, "and they have those ones I'd been lusting after"
Crag says, "Are you going to buy a new manual before you come back?!"
stormagnet says, "the elctric+manual hybrids"
stormagnet says, "I'm toying with it"
Crag says, "Yes!"
Crag says, "I... am in favor of this."
stormagnet says, "I still haven't gone to see how expensive they are"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "well yes, that is the questions"
stormagnet says, "they're also smaller, and lighter"
stormagnet says, "and, of course, CUTER"
Crag says, "OF COURSE"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "Everything in Japan is cuter"
Crag says, "It's like everything's BIG in Texas."
stormagnet says, "but they look just MASSIVELY more manueuverable and flexible"
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "yes!"
stormagnet says, "I just love the idea of being to switch modes in the same chair"
stormagnet says, "it'll make curb climbing SO. MUCH. EASIER"
stormagnet says, "and I can Not Worry About The Batteries Dying"
stormagnet says, "and still get exercise!"
Crag nodsnods
stormagnet says, "and they look like they'd fold up a lot lighter and smaller than my other"
Crag says, "That will be the key factor"
stormagnet says, "I don;t think they have anywhere near the speed and milage"
stormagnet says, "but that's A-Ok!"
Crag says, "Yep"
Crag making tea, brb
Crag . o O ( unless someone talks to me on the way to or from the kitchen )
Crag says, "holy crap"
Crag says, "CHris Helms gave his notice"
Crag says, "Also, we got approved for more headcount in our group"
Crag says, "Also, Jennifer asked me if would prefer one larger monitor or two monitors (I picked two)"
Crag says, "She's going to take another stab at getting my desktop replaced"
stormagnet says, "whoa!!"
stormagnet O_O
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "that was quite a cup of tea!!"
Crag says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "When it rains it pours"
stormagnet nodnods!!
stormagnet says, "aw, crap"
stormagnet says, "I finished my food and the manga I was reading"
stormagnet says, "and it's 3am"
stormagnet says, "I have to do more homework now"
stormagnet says, "and I *still* haven't finished my paper"
stormagnet (T_T)
stormagnet says, "I suspect that one of the reasons the dorm kids have time to party so much is that they've been divvying up homework and notes"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "that must be nice"
stormagnet says, "it's comforting to remember that I don't actually *need* these credits"
stormagnet says, "and that they won't affect my GPA for squat"
stormagnet says, "but my pride just won't let me slack properly"
stormagnet says, "especially since I feel like I have to represent"
stormagnet says, "as a disability trailblazer, or something"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "ooog"
Crag says, "aw"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag hugs!
stormagnet hugs!!
Crag says, "Binder sent me an approving X in response to my post about Greg's game."
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "I'm litening to Pandora and it's playing a bossa nova version of Paint It Black for me"
Crag | http://www.pandora.com/music/album/various+artists/bossa+n+stones+vol+2
Crag says, "I'm adding it to my amazon wishlist :P"
Crag says, "You're probably (hopefully?) sleeping now, so I'm going to do some serious idling now"
Crag idles: hating work
[Idling at 11:24 A.M. on Wed, Nov 28: hating work]
stormagnet says, "yay Bossa Nova paint it black!"
stormagnet wants
stormagnet is not sleeping, yet, sadly
stormagnet says, "BUT"
stormagnet says, "I'm about to throw in the towel"
stormagnet says, "even if I did catch some sleep earlier, two all nighters in a row is just suicide"
stormagnet says, "...though it's practically an all-nighter all ready...."
stormagnet _|-|o
Crag says, "GO TO SLEEP"
Crag says, "Don't make me come over there"
[Idling at 12:06 P.M. on Wed, Nov 28: hating work]
stormagnet goes to sleep >_<
stormagnet hugs and smooches and cuddles
stormagnet idles: save me, rilakkuma~!
stormagnet says, "........shit"
stormagnet says, "going to bed was a mistake"
stormagnet just woke up >_<
stormagnet says, "at 2:00pm"
stormagnet says, "too late to make it to *any* of my classes"
stormagnet says, "or even take the garbage out on time"
Crag says, "Oh hey"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag back in a few
Crag says, "well"
Crag says, "I hung out with Tiff again today"
Crag says, "I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that she doesn't have much to offer."
Crag says, "I'm going to continue spending time with her"
Crag says, "It may be that she's just overwhelmed with life challenges"
Crag says, "Some of what she says confuses me."
Crag says, "I feel like some of what she says or does is to test me in some way"
Crag says, "Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that by itself"
Crag says, "But maybe it's all a test?  Or maybe none of it is."
Crag says, "She said she wants to learn about computers, but when I started telling her about computers today she didn't seem to actually be interested at all."
Crag says, "She gives me the impression that she wants me to do things for her"
Crag says, "And it feels like the tests she's subjecting me are looking for a way to inspire me to want to do things for her"
Crag says, "Some of it would work if she kept at it"
Crag says, "But she changes methods abruptly enough that I am questioning her sincerity"
Crag says, "Sometimes she seems to be reciting parts"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "that sounds pretty Scorpionic"
Crag says, "Exactly!"
stormagnet says, "and that's the more Conventionally Female way of acting with guys you like"
stormagnet says, "as well"
Crag says, "and then I wonder if I'm just interpreting her that way because I know she's a Scorpio :)"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "THOROUGHLY possible"
Crag says, "There's some more data too"
stormagnet says, "she could have been distracted, or maybe computers are harder than she thought, or whatever"
stormagnet says, "but...."
Crag says, "well, the point of our meeting today was to talk about computer stuff"
stormagnet says, "it seems pretty likely that yeah, she was basically using it as an excuse to spend time with you"
Crag says, "I don't mind if that's the case, of course :)"
stormagnet says, "and a lot of girls pretend to be interested in a guy's hobbies in order to 'get them to like you'"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "there's a lot of 'get them to like you' strategies >_<"
Crag says, "it's totally not working on me"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "I like her a little DESPITE her efforts, if that's what they are"
stormagnet says, "we're a little.... unusual"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "but that unusualness is a large part of your appeal ^_^"
Crag says, "I've changed a lot.  There was a time when I would have eagerly fallen for whatever trick someone wanted to play on me."
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "But Catherine cracked that nut and you pried it open :)"
stormagnet laughs!
Crag says, "in a good way, obviously :)"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "So the more data part"
Crag says, "She has some repetitiveness to her that disturbs me"
Crag says, "I'm trying to think of the specifics now"
Crag says, "It's things she says like about not wanting people to mention Eric around her"
Crag says, "But she says it in EXACTLY the same way, three times now"
stormagnet laughs
Crag says, "And I haven't mentioned him at all"
stormagnet says, "oh dear"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "ANd she's mentioned TWICE that she's worried she'll run into him at a party"
stormagnet says, "she's being Conventionally Female"
Crag says, "ugh"
stormagnet says, "in that kind of passive-agressive way"
Crag says, "I think she'd be a lot more interesting if she let go of that crap"
stormagnet says, "what this translates to is:"
stormagnet says, "please, talk to me about Eric, so I can be Vulnerable and you can Sooth Me"
Crag says, "I let her talk about whatever she wants to :)"
stormagnet says, "the reason she keeps saying it the same way is because she's rehearsing it in her head"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "She has had lots of vulnerable episodes"
Crag says, "And I let her have them"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "I listen and nod and smile knowingly"
Crag says, "I don't tell her she's right or wrong"
Crag says, "But"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "I don't feel like soothing her"
Crag says, "If she said she needed a hug, I would give her a hug"
stormagnet says, "a lot of girls feel that being direct about these things is off-putting"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Well, sometimes being direct IS off-putting"
stormagnet says, "there's a huge cultural programming that tells girls to be manipulative to get what you want"
Crag says, "but like so many things there's a balance :)"
stormagnet says, "because asking for it is wrong"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah, that's very true"
Crag says, "But I don't speak code"
Crag says, "so..."
Crag says, "reh"
stormagnet says, "most guys don't"
stormagnet says, "which is, of course, the problem"
Crag says, "one of many :)"
stormagnet says, "as oft cited by sit-coms everywhere"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "also true"
stormagnet says, "basically, iedeally, the guy will pick up these cues, translate them mentally, and then act on them"
stormagnet says, "so that the girl never has to say it directly"
stormagnet says, "this shows that he Understands Her Feelings"
Crag says, "Any idea what she expects me to do?"
stormagnet says, "and that sort of semi-psychic/psychological-decoding shows that you're Meant For Eachother"
Crag heh
Crag says, "oh man, the meant for eachother thing... she keeps setting off my 'trying to be meant for each other' alarm"
stormagnet says, "tell her that you won't bring up Eric around her, but if she 'ever needs to talk'"
stormagnet says, "that's a set phrase right there"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "Ah, ok"
stormagnet says, "yeah, she's probably trying pretty hard"
Crag says, "Heh, here's an amusing example of How Right You Are."
stormagnet says, "which is kind of cute :)"
Crag says, "Yeah, it is cute"
Crag grins
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "today's best example:"
Crag says, "We met at beths.  I said I was thinking about having a grilled cheese and she said that's exactly what she was thinking of having!"
Crag says, "Wow!"
stormagnet LAUGHS
stormagnet says, "oh dear"
Crag says, "It was so classic I almost thought she was kidding"
Crag says, "But she wasn't."
stormagnet says, "you realize that girl's magazines, like Cosmo, are basically manuals for this kind of thing"
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag sighs
stormagnet says, "which is one reason I read them - it gives me a little social insight into a process I used to be Utterly Clueless about"
stormagnet says, "they will give step-by-step directions"
Crag says, "I'm going to leave that work to you.  I don't have the stomach for it"
Crag says, "The work of tracking the social crap"
stormagnet says, "to the point where, if you were feeling really dedicated and kind of creepy about it, you could probably deduce which magazines she reads by which strategies she tries :P"
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "ew"
Crag says, "That would be creepy"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Sounds like something Daniel would do"
Crag grins.
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "And pride himself on too"
stormagnet says, "this is why Daniel is Irresistable to that kind of girl"
stormagnet nods
Crag says, "yeah"
Crag says, "And disturbingly, Melanie kinda is that girl :)"
stormagnet says, "and it's good that he's out there, since he enjoys it :)"
Crag says, "But she's more than that, so he's still interested after all these years."
stormagnet says, "oh absolutely"
stormagnet says, "that's why they crack me up"
Crag says, "totally"
stormagnet says, "they're so perfect for each other!"
stormagnet says, "I love those pictures they took in France"
Crag says, "Yeah :)"
stormagnet says, "I bet they're having a great time :)"
Crag says, "They remind me of Daniel's parents."
Crag says, "I think so too"
stormagnet says, "the flip side to this sort of thing"
stormagnet says, "is that what they *really* want is someone who will understand them when they haven't figured themselves out"
stormagnet says, "so that when they don't even know what they want, their partner will give it to them"
stormagnet says, "that sort of, 'really thinks hard about me and knows what I'm thinking and feeling' thing"
stormagnet says, "is a measure of love"
Crag says, "That sounds like you and me"
Crag says, "well"
stormagnet says, "and having it fulfilled gives them a lot of security"
Crag says, "I think you give that to me at least"
Crag says, "I don't know if I do that for you :)"
stormagnet does her best :)
stormagnet says, ""
stormagnet says, "it's interesting"
stormagnet says, "because this fits really well into what I'm studying in my psych class over here"
Crag says, "Awesome!"
stormagnet says, "since this sort of thing is WAY more pronounced in Japan"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, that makes sense"
stormagnet says, "'amae' psychology"
stormagnet says, "and why 'sunao' heroines are Special"
stormagnet says, "the female leads in anime, who AREN'T doing it on purpose"
stormagnet says, "except once in awhile, when they totally fail at it, for comedic effect :)"
Crag grins.
Crag says, "Oh... bamboo blade 9 is out"
stormagnet says, "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Crag says, "We could watch it tonight if you've got time"
stormagnet nodnods!!!
Crag says, "oh, except you'd have to copy it"
stormagnet says, "yeah"
Crag says, "Can you grab it via torrent on your end?"
Crag says, "maybe?"
stormagnet says, "that would keep you up too late"
Crag says, "yeah"
stormagnet says, "torrent is sloooooow"
Crag says, "oh well"
Crag says, "We should still watch something"
stormagnet says, "so is copying"
stormagnet says, "dang"
stormagnet says, "yeah!"
Crag says, "ohwait"
Crag says, "9 is by that crappy AEN subbing group"
Crag says, "We could wait for Huzzah and Doremi to sub it"
Crag says, "I got their version of 7 in case you want to re-watch it"
stormagnet cheers!!
Crag says, "That was the REALLY bad one"
stormagnet remembers
stormagnet giggles
Crag says, "so bad!"
Crag says, "We haven't watch minami-ke 7 yet"

stormagnet says, "or Denno?"
Crag says, "Oh yeah!"
Crag says, "Either!"
Crag says, "We haven't watch El Cazador together yet"
Crag says, "That would be a treat"
stormagnet nodnods!
Crag says, "I need to change into a robe"
Crag says, "It's kinda hot in the apartment"
stormagnet says, "ok!"
stormagnet brabs a snack
Crag says, "I think the neighbors' tolerance for cold is much lower than mine"
Crag says, "I'm leaching their heat or something"
stormagnet laughs
stormagnet says, "ah, apartments"
Crag says, "Oh, Tiff and I watched ep 1 of Peach Girl last time she came over and this time we watched eps 2-4"
stormagnet says, "yay!"
Crag says, "It's weird watching the series over again, but interesting too"
stormagnet says, "I really liked that one :)"
Crag says, "I remember!"
Crag says, "I liked it too"
Crag says, "And I like it again"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Tiff says Sae got her own show or manga or something afterwords that explains more of her point of view or something"
stormagnet says, "I hadn't heard about that!"
Crag says, "Something to look into perhaps"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I connected to the MOO from the laptop so that I can view the show full screen and use both keyboards for syncing :)"
stormagnet says, "w000t!!"
Crag says, "I'm all set, so let me know when you're ready"
stormagnet just send you pictures :)
stormagnet says, "er, sent"
Crag says, "Oh, sweet, I'll take a look"

Crag says, "oh"
Crag says, "ok"
stormagnet says, "they're being a little mysterious"
Crag says, "heh"
Crag says, "They DO that..."

Crag idles: dear kitties, please let me sleep 8 hours
[Idling at 11:33 P.M. on Wed, Nov 28: dear kitties, please let me sleep 8 hours]
stormagnet says, "hmmmm"
stormagnet says, "executive decision #2"
stormagnet says, "I can't afford to wait for the library bureaucratic crap to clear before  getting the references I need for this project"
stormagnet says, "but if I ordered them from Amazon and got expedited shipping, they'd be here by tomorrow"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet says, "whoa"
stormagnet says, "Amazon Prime in Japan is only 3900Y"
stormagnet says, "...."
stormagnet makes executive decision
stormagnet picks up the rest of Baccano while she's at it
Crag grins
Crag idles: off to work again
[Idling at 8:02 A.M. on Thu, Nov 29: off to work again]
Crag returns from work
Crag says, "Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei 10 is on its way"
Crag says, "I think work may have underpaid me for last week because of the change in policy about friday"
Crag says, "It's not gonna hurt us any"
Crag says, "but it's a little irritating"
Crag says, "I'm gonna go take a bath and when I get back I'm doing a solaris install"
Crag says, "crap, I don't have the SATA cable I need"
Crag says, "So I can either halt wrack and borrow one of the redundant cables in their"
Crag says, "or pick one up on my way to or from work tomorrow"
Crag says, "I had forgotten that ildana's current drive is PATA"
Crag says, "So I can't just use its cable"
Crag says, "this is all way too complicated"
Crag says, "I'll pick up another cable tomorrow"
Crag says, "I wish I could put 'SATA cable' on my safeway.com order"
Crag says, "I'm ordering one bottle each of three Gevurztraminers for taste testing purposes. :)"
Crag says, "Also to pad my order"
Crag says, "And I'm still $2.56 short of $150"
Crag says, "I guess I'll have to taste-test some merlots too"
Crag says, "I'm sleepy, gonna lie down"
Crag back
Crag says, "I has kitties"
Crag says, "I'm hanging out with the laptop in bed"
Crag says, "Marco has installed himself next to me."
Crag says, "Sancho's at the foot of the bed"
Crag says, "Oh yeah, I signed up for at-work massage tomorrow"
Crag says, "I'll let you know how that goes"
Crag says, "Running low on battery"
Crag says, "I guess I'll snooze or something"
Crag idles: <insert clever message here>
[Idling at 8:14 P.M. on Thu, Nov 29: <insert clever message here>]
Crag rolls critical failure trying to sleep
Crag idles: let's try this sleeping thing again
[Idling at 8:32 P.M. on Thu, Nov 29: let's try this sleeping thing again]
Crag says, "ARG"
Crag says, "Sancho woke me up"
Crag says, "Huzzah-Doremi version of Bamboo Blade 8 is downloading"
Crag says, "And I have 6 and 7 for re-watching if we want."
Crag says, "neighbors are bumping around in the middle of the night again"
Crag says, "Not as loudly as the time they woke me up"
Crag says, "but I'm getting the impression that these people are ogres"
Crag says, "I guess you won't be online tonight."
Crag says, "Leave me lots of scroll, I'm going into stormeh withdrawl."
Crag idles: let there be sleep
[Idling at 2:25 A.M. on Fri, Nov 30: let there be sleep]
stormagnet says, "aw!!!"
stormagnet says, "I'm sorry I missed you :("
stormagnet says, "I slept All. Day."
stormagnet says, "and still feel pretty ooog"
stormagnet says, "but I went to class just for the first 15 mijnutes, so I could turn in my homework and take the kanji quiz"
stormagnet says, "and found out that once again, half the class was out sick at the same time"
stormagnet says, "so I'm trying to remind myself that all of our immunes systems are Not Used to Japan's colds and flues"
stormagnet says, "er, flus"
stormagnet says, "and that it's Totally Understandable for me to be getting sick so much"
stormagnet was kind of beating herself up about it
stormagnet says, "ooooooh- my books are here!"
stormagnet says, "ummm.. they sent me two copies of Gakumon no Susume... I'm a have to send one back (-_-;;)"
stormagnet says, "and the one I really, *really* needed isn't in here...."
stormagnet _|-|O
stormagnet . o O ( is the universe telling me to cut it out and rest? )
stormagnet . o O ( I sure hope so, because there's no fucking way I'm tackling this in Japanese without a translation at hand O_O; )
stormagnet says, "so... umm...."
stormagnet says, "yay for harddrive!"
stormagnet says, "boo for no cable!"
stormagnet says, "but yay for massages and wine and kittahs!"
stormagnet says, "but boo for noisy neighbors!"
stormagnet says, "hmmm"
stormagnet (-_-;)
stormagnet says, "I apparantly need to pay return shipping to return this copy of gakumon?!"
stormagnet says, "it's so cheap, I wouldn't make back the cover price >_<"
stormagnet says, "and it's my fault for being to zonked out to notice that it had ended up in my basket twice"
stormagnet says, "goddammit"
stormagnet says, "maybe I'll give it someone"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "at least it was only, like, $5"
stormagnet says, "omg, my English version of the Pillow Book *wasn't* included"
stormagnet says, "*just* the Japanese"
stormagnet headdesks repeatedly
stormagnet says, "wtf is wrong with me?"
stormagnet says, "at least I don't have to freak over incurring extra shipping, since I got Prime"
stormagnet says, "but, dammit!!"
stormagnet says, "I might want to get Prime when I come back to the US, too"
stormagnet says, "it wasn't worth it before, but since going out shopping in the wheelchair is so damn complicated, suddenly it's a LOT more worth it"
stormagnet says, "hell, most of the bookstores I've found here, the aisles are too narrow for me to enter"
stormagnet sighs
stormagnet says, "but, hey, Amazon's allright"
stormagnet says, "the delivery guy has gotten used to me"
stormagnet says, "when I opened the door this time, he was looking down, instead of over my head"
stormagnet keeps startling other delivery people when she opens the door
stormagnet says, "oog, BofA really has been chargiong some steep fees when I take cash out of the post-office ATM"
stormagnet says, "I just didn't see them before"
stormagnet says, "it would be worth asking the Evergreen Bank people how their fees would compare on a sample transaction"
Crag wakes due to Sancho AGAIN
Crag says, "We can go to Evergreen while you're here and you can do all the talking"
Crag | http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/11/30/peace-negoshiayshuns/
Crag says, "You should always cut yourself more slack"
Crag says, "Your Aires moon is in your first house"
Crag says, "All the rest of your plantes are in your seventh through tenth houses"
Crag says, "The first house is your identity, sense of self, etc"
Crag says, "Houses 7 through 12 are all about other people"
Crag says, "You're totally fair, judicious, balanced, etc with the rest of the world, but when it comes to you and especially your feelings, you're impulsive and aggressive."
Crag says, "or something"
Crag says, "If I were to dare to make a suggestion based on your chart (dare! dare!) it would be this"
Crag says, "When you think your Aries moon gets you down ("I'm not active enough" or something), invoke your retrograde Mercury in Libra by thinking or talking about things, especially reviewing yourself.  Retrogrades are associated with review, so if chart reading can work the other way around like this, you should find that when you think and talk about review that it tends to be balanced and judicious"
Crag says, "Mercury is in your 7th house, which is partnerships/marriage, so maybe that means think about me?"
Crag says, "What would I say about whatever you're getting down on yourself about"
Crag says, "ANd of course the answer would always be that you're awesome and your worst is better than most people's best."
Crag says, "I should try applying this technique to me and see if it helps me any"
Crag looks at his chart
Crag says, "Looking at my chart, when I run up against the limiations of beauracracy(sp?) I should look to Mercury in Aquarius and Uranus in Libra for help..."
Crag says, "As well as Jupiter in Pisces..."
Crag says, "Ah..."
Crag says, "According to the astrolog help doc, Uranus represents one's individuality, desires for change, and tendency to go against social norms."
Crag says, "Well"
Crag says, "It's true that when paperwork gets in my way I feel like a revolution is in order"
Crag says, "But it's in my third house so I just end up talking about it"
Crag says, "Mercury is in my eight house"
Crag says, "So when this happens my thoughts are logical and destructive"
Crag says, "blank slate falacies"
Crag says, "This paperwork is stupid.  We should throw out all paperwork for some other system I haven't come up with yet."
Crag says, "that sounds like me"
Crag says, "at least on the inside"
Crag says, "I don't know how to read this configuration in reverse yet"
"I'll" is not the name of any player.
Crag says, "I'll have to try again later"
Crag says, "But for now it's time for me to go to work"
Crag idles: There's Mercury in Uranus
[Idling at 7:58 A.M. on Fri, Nov 30: There's Mercury in Uranus]
stormagnet laughs!
stormagnet says, "that was a very accurate reading :)"
stormagnet says, "I tend to go easiest on myself when I try and evaluate myself as I would another person, or from another person's perspective"
stormagnet says, "and easiest of all when I think of you :)"
stormagnet says, "but at the same time, it seems like, *because* it's myself, I can't afford to go easy, or something"
stormagnet says, "it's maybe not entirely logical"
stormagnet ^_^;
stormagnet says, "I swear, one of my deepest cravings is to have someone save me from myself"
stormagnet says, "it's where my sub side switches on.."
stormagnet says, "force me to be loved and taken care of and protected and spoiled rotten"
stormagnet says, "where I would otherwise force myself to work hard for everyone else until I drop dead, and *still* not think it enough"
stormagnet says, "I'm kind of conflicted that way ^_^;;"
stormagnet says, "but you help me a lot :)"
stormagnet says, "man, there's a winter bazaar and mochi making festival today"
stormagnet says, "why do I always get sick just in time to miss out on the things I'm really looking forward to >_<"
stormagnet was going to get one of those quilted happi coats to wear at the kotatsu!!
stormagnet was going to eat fresh mochi!!
stormagnet says, "I guess there's always the Setagaya BoroIchi and New-Year's to look forward too..."
stormagnet says, "but man, this flu is inconvenient"
stormagnet says, "..."
stormagnet says, "at least I got to finish reading all of Love Monster"
stormagnet is feeling very satisfied from that
stormagnet says, "I'm going to sleep some"
stormagnet says, "I'll set an alarm so I wake up around the time you come home, though"
stormagnet says, "since I slept all day anyway ^_^;"
stormagnet says, "I want to watch things with you :)"
stormagnet says, "I'll feel better about missing things if I go buy some mochi at the convenience store and then huddle up at the kotatsu watching Denno and El Cazador with you"
stormagnet ^_^
stormagnet says, "it'll probably be better for curing my flu, too :)"
stormagnet says, "since my stomach seems mostly recovered now, after having slept all day like that"
Crag says, "I never thought of dom/sub as having a saving someone aspect"
Crag says, "I find that kinda hot"
Crag says, "I will happily continue to dominate you in that way"
Crag [to stormagnet]: Go easy on yourself!  Take a nap!  Eat some delicious foods!  YOU DESERVE IT!!!
Crag says, "Yay!  I can't wait to get home now!"
Crag says, "Ok, here's the actual reason I logged in from work:"
Crag | http://www.unitseven.co.nz/
Crag says, "By way of notcot of course"
Crag says, "It's supposed to snow tomorrow"
Crag says, "1 inch likely"
Crag says, "possibly a little more"
Crag says, "It'll all wash away Sunday though"
Crag says, "But who knows, maybe you'll get a white Christmas :)"
Crag says, "The massage helped a LOT"
Crag says, "I can breath all the way in without it hurting"
Crag struggles to stay motivated to work for two more hours
stormagnet says, "OH. MY. GOD."
stormagnet says, "that map is AWESOME"
Crag grins
Crag says, "Neither the Office Depot nor the Radio Shack downtown stocks SATA cables"
Crag says, "So I'm going to have to shut down wrack at some point to use one of the redundant cables in it"
Crag says, "omg hayate 34 is out"
Crag says, "I can't keep up with all this anime!"
stormagnet says, "eeeee!"
Crag says, "Also, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei 11"
stormagnet says, "EEEEE!"
Crag says, "Also, Myself; Yourself 9"
stormagnet still needs to watch the first 8 ^_^;
Crag says, "yeah me too"
Crag says, "I only watched 1 and now I'm waiting for you :)"
stormagnet grins
Crag says, "I watched that one episode and decided it was something to watch together"
stormagnet nods!
Crag says, "I don't even remember what it's about or anything"
stormagnet queues
stormagnet says, "erm"
stormagnet says, "where *is* #1?"
Crag peers
Crag says, "whoops"
Crag says, "I never put any in for-stormy!"
Crag says, "heh"
stormagnet says, "heh"
stormagnet ^_^
Crag says, "Lemme get right on that..."
Crag says, "ohwait, we might not have space"
stormagnet says, "ahhh"
Crag says, "Ah, we have space"
stormagnet says, "oh good!"
Crag says, "I don't remember what I deleted, but we have 11g free"
Crag says, "I'll copy it from my desktop and let you know when that's done"
stormagnet cheers!
stormagnet says, "SO...."
stormagnet says, "meanwhile..."
Crag says, "hold on, something's wrong with wrack..."
stormagnet says, "eh?!"
stormagnet says, "NOES!!"
Crag says, "donkey's not running and it won't start"
Crag says, "oh poo"
Crag says, "wrack's fine"
Crag says, "The reason I thought I had 11g free was that I was on the wrong machine"
Crag says, "wrack is full again"
stormagnet laughs!!
Crag sighs
stormagnet did that!
stormagnet says, "before"
Crag says, "so that brings us to the hard drive problem"
stormagnet says, "the mistaking machines"
stormagnet nods
stormagnet can wait :)
Crag says, "Can I call you on skype?"
stormagnet nods!
stormagnet says, "tho I'm kind of sniffly ^_^;;"
Crag says, "bye bye!"
