Subject:  Feature: bug/feature tracking system

Replace *bug with a pseudo-list which creates new tickets which are themselves mailing lists (*b:num, maybe).  Add a bug manipulation feature which lists, searches, and acts on bugs in groups.

Alternatively, create an in-MOO interface to an external bug database.
