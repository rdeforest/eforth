                            Happy Birthday, marmot!                            

There's a pair of handcuffs by the bed. They're surrounded by empty Chinese
food cartons, an empty bottle of wine, and two wine glasses. One of the
glasses has fallen over, leaving a red stain on the carpet which slowly
creeps towards the handcuffs.

The alarm clock went off an hour ago, but the room's inhabitants have shut
it off, preferring the warmth of their shared bed to the cold of the real
world.

                       This is OpalMOO.  Welcome to it.

        The suspiciously scrawny rubber banshee self-immolates noisily.

Ow, crampped. The blanket in the back probably covers a hole that the cold could get in through, so don't move it to much. How can anyone live in a refridgerator box?

OpalMOO Cemetery
You see a graveyard here. Tombstones seem perfect for lying upon, toppling over, or lighting cigarettes on. It's cold, and a fine mist glides over the ground... altogether creepy in a terribly sensual way. The open door of the crypt creaks as it moves in the wind. 
You see Plush Wooden Coffin and Dylan here.
Indigo (out on her feet), marmot (out on her feet), Wellsie (dozing), neuro (out on our feet), Kayti (out on her feet), RatdowsXP (out on his feet), mew (dozing), JoD (out on his feet), Icarus (out on his feet), Blackbriar (out on his feet), samsarra (out on her feet), Profane (out on his feet), and Tobin (out on his feet) are here.
