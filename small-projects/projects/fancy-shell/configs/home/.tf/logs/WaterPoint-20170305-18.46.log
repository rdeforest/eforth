The Coastal Path
A relatively smooth path along the coast.  The ocean rolls against the rocky coast.  It is dark out and the stars are shining.  It is cold.  The coastal path continues to the southeast and north.

Subject:  Small vulnerability potential in use of crypt()

[For some reason I wasn't allowed to send this to *security]

The string returned by crypt() is case-sensitive, and should only be compared using equal() or strcmp().

Unfortunately, $login:connect uses != to compare the result of crypt() with a player's saved password hash. This could allow someone to connect as the player using any string that happens to have a similar hash, differing only in case.

Although the crypt() password keyspace is 72,057,594,037,927,936 in size, I estimate this reduces the effective keyspace to at most 70,368,744,177,664. I could be off.

When you have a verb name on a feature like #750:@pw*xml the help system will not match "help @pw" against it.

Subject:  "move"

The Waterpoint move Saturday was from one Linode in the Dallas data center (768M, Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit) to another Linode in the same data center (1G, Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 64-bit).

A while back Linode doubled all Linode sizes and upgraded their hardware. This move takes advantage of that update moving down to the cheaper 1G plan rather than going to the overkill 1.5G plan. Linode could have migrated the old VPS automatically, but that would've migrated the obsolete 11.04 install as well as taking a lot longer.

The MOO server is compiled 32-bit.

WP stayed at the same IP address (I set up the new VPS and then swapped the IP with the old VPS) for the move.

At the same time, I repackaged the HTTP proxy and updated it to run on Go 1.1, and switched from Apache to Nginx for the static site. I also began setting up the short URL domain (wtpt.org) on the same box (it's currently hosted on Dreamhost). When it moves to this box it'll proxy /tu to the MOO rather than redirecting. (All other URLs will redirect.) That'll save one redirect when using the short URL redirector.

It's now also encrypting/backing up the database to S3 in addition to its other backup targets.

Subject:  Waterpoint outage

Linode took the hypervisor node that is on down with no warning. It was an unsafe shutdown and we lost everything since the last checkpoint. Way to go, Linode.

Subject:  another day, another linode emergency

The latest crash (they called it "emergency maintenance" but an unclean shutdown is a crash) is courtesy Linode. They migrated this instance to another physical host, so in theory there should be more stability now.

It's probably time to start exploring other options, but I am not sure they will be any better. Relying on a single instance basically means things will break sometimes.
