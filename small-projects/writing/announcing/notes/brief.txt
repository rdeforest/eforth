Subject: Robert de Forest no longer drinks alcohol

Friends, family, and colleagues:

I have chosen to adopt a non-drinking lifestyle. As of now, any interest I
express in consuming alcoholic beverages is out of character and may be taken
as evidence that I am unwell.

This decision and the change are major and many of you will have questions or
concerns. In a few days I intend to post a great deal more about it at
http://robert.defore.st for those who are interested. It is currently just a
placeholder.

I mean to broadcast this message to everyone who might want/need to hear
it. To that end, please feel free to share this news with anyone else you
think would like to or needs to hear about it whom I might not have contact
information for. I'm thinking especially of people who only converse on
Facebook.

Some of you will receive multiple copies of this message as I am going to sendÂ 
it from both my home and work addresses and my home and work contact lists
included some of you more than once. I apologize for the extras.

I thank you all for your patience and understanding in this matter.

Robert Andrew de Forest
