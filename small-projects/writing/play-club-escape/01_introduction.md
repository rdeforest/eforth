## Introduction

The eroge "Play Club" by ILLUSION was a huge disappointment to me. In that
game there are five sex scenes introducing the player to the situation and the
.. victims. After that it's just "pick your aggressor and victim and go to
town." It barely qualifies as a sex simulator. There aren't even transitions
between positions like in ILLUSION's Artificial Girl 3. It's definitely not my
idea of "fun."

This story is my way of putting some context back into that game. I ignore the
bulk of the dialog because it's poorly written but retain the premise, which
will be come clear right away.

TRIGGER WARNING! The game is entirely non-consensual and this story only
address a small part of that.
