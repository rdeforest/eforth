# Thoughts on work

Yesterday (2016-08-03) when Rich showed me I'm completely out of PIP-land, I
joked "it's smooth sailing from here" and he quickly reacted in what I would
describe as a negative way. This concerns me.

Another example of something Rich has said which has had mixed impact on me.
He described me as one of his potential start players in a way which feels
like a kind of pressure and expectation which I do not welcome. I want my great
works to be a natural side effect of doing what I love. Doing what I love is my
greatest concern, not the output I produce.

Separately from my more specific ambitions, my goal for my career is for it to
be _easy_ and _safe_. I like challenges to be buffet style as opposed to a
7-course-meal chosen by the chef. The hard parts of work should be the work
itself, not expectations from me, my friends, my family, my co-workers or the
world at large. I don't respond well to traditionally masculine motivators such
as those so often linked to sports.

Obviously I work within a context which imposes hard requirements I do not
presume to escape. The entire management hierarchy is beholden to customers
of all kinds and if leadership can find someone who can out perform me at the
same cost they should certainly give that person my job. That means I have to
have some display of performance which they can estimate confidently. To that
end Rich and I need to define and document concrete goals and performance
metrics to serve that estimation.

I believe I actually work better within a framework which supports that
objective. Rich may not like the degree to which it does not accurately
reflect reality, and in a sense I agree with him, but I like to feel safe in
knowing that "as long as I do X I'm safe" is a great comfort to me.

# What I want

## Job Security

  - In the present: A well defined and easily tracked minimum bar I must meet to remain in good standing with Amazon.
  - In the future: A low-friction process for negotiating the life-cycle of components of that minimum bar.
  - Socially: To be trusted by peers and leadership to drive my own ambitions at the pace I'm most comfortable with.

This is not a lack of ambition. It is how I manage my anxieties. I already have
too much and too many ambitions. Any added to that are detrimental.

## To work side-by-side with others

I can work independently, but I don't like it and I believe I'm more
productive working in tandem with others. In Payments I worked with my
co-workers to rearchitect our documentation, to address oppressive ticket
load, to troubleshoot difficult problems, to test HSMs for suitability to our
mobile payments encryption requirements, and to draw up a proposal to move the
Payments Secure Zone into AWS. These were very productive adventures.

At my previous position at Fred Hutch I was the only person on my team but I
worked closely with other teams regularly. I almost never worked alone at
Disney. Since coming to AWS it has been gratifying to be trusted to be
productive in isolation, but it has been difficult in a non-technical way and
I'm certain I could have been more productive working side-by-side with
people.

Rich and I have talked about this before and I know he understands and agrees,
and I also know that his hands are somewhat tied in that there's nobody else
on the team whose time would be better spent working with me. He's trying to
hire engineers as fast as he can. but he is also competing with the rest of
the company for talent as evidenced by the recent thread on
systems-engineers@.

# What I am _not_ asking for

I am not asking that I be held to a lower standard than others. I _am_ asking
that I not be held to a _higher_ standard. Someone once told me a story about
a band leader in school who gave them lower grades than less capable students
because he thought this person weren't meeting their potential. This kind of
approach is extremely de-motivating for me.

If I appear to not be "applying" myself or "living up to my potential" it is
not the case. Whatever I accomplish is exactly what my potential actually was,
even if it does not meet some people's expectations for me.
