# Thoughts on work

Yesterday (2016-08-03) when Rich showed me I'm completely out of PIP-land, I
joked "it's smooth sailing from here" and he quickly reacted in what I would
describe as a negative way. This concerns me.

Another example of something Rich has said which has had mixed impact on me.
He described me as one of his potential start players in a way which feels
like a kind of pressure and expectation which I do not welcome. I want my great
works to be a natural side effect of doing what I love. Doing what I love is my
greatest concern, not the output I produce.

Separately from my more specific ambitions, my goal for my career is for it to
be _easy_ and _safe_. I like challenges to be buffet style as opposed to a
7-course-meal chosen by the chef. The hard parts of work should be the work
itself, not expectations from me, my friends, my family, my co-workers or the
world at large. I don't respond well to traditionally masculine motivators such
as those so often linked to sports.

Obviously I work within a context which imposes hard requirements I do not
presume to escape. The entire management hierarchy is beholden to customers
of all kinds and if leadership can find someone who can out perform me at the
same cost they should certainly give that person my job. That means I have to
have some display of performance which they can estimate confidently. To that
end Rich and I need to define and document concrete goals and performance
metrics to serve that estimation.

I believe I actually work better within a framework which supports that
objective. Rich may not like the degree to which it does not accurately
reflect reality, and in a sense I agree with him, but I like to feel safe and
knowing that "as long as I do X I'm safe" is a great comfort to me.

# What I want

I want three things:

- Static Safety: A well defined and easily tracked minimum bar I must meet to remain in good standing with Amazon.

- Dynamic Safety: A low-friction process for negotiating the life-cycle of components of that minimum bar.

- No additional expectations: The freedom to only meet the minimum bar and no other, without judgement or repercussions.

This does not come from a not lack of ambition. It is how I manage my
anxieties. For me, too much ambition is a far greater problem than not enough.

# What I am _not_ asking for

I am not asking that I be held to a lower standard than others. I _am_ asking
that I not be held to a _higher_ standard. Someone once told me a story about a
band leader in school who gave them lower grades than less capable students
because he thought my this person weren't meeting their potential. This kind of
approach is extremely de-motivating for me.

If I appear to not be applying myself or living up to my potential it is not
the case.
