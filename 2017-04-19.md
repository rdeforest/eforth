Focus on my part in communications

- depth and consequences of my words
- maybe with Dr. L

- learn how to be a big dog in a small room

What do I want to say?

- I want to collaborate with her
- "When you expect the worst, you won't be disappointed."
- I want her to communicate more, but less aggressively
