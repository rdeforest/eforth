    - participant.pendingMessages()
    - item.acknowledge()

  - UI
    - User sign-up

Doing:
  - Expose new methods

Done:
  - Does model.coffee replace model.js?
    - YES!
  - participant.pendingMessages()
    - Does participant.items() do what I think?
      - Apparenly, but need to create an example item to be sure
      - Easier said than done, but whatever.
    - make item.due() and .acknowledge work
    - make pendingMessages work
