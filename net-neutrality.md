# Introduction: appeal to authority (me)

I have been a denizen of the Internet since the fall of 1992. I provided phone
support for Windows 95 from launch in August to December when call volume
dropped to a point where Microsoft could shut down one of their call centers.
I have been supporting the infrastructure of the internet since 1996 when I
joined Got.net (The Internet Connection) as what was then known as a Unix
System Administrator but is now referred to as a System Engineer. I worked at
Got.net for a combined four years, Disney for 8 and I've been at Amazon for
almost 5.
